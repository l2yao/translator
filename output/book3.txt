*   **Lecture 2:** The Secret to Increasing Fortune and Changing Destiny: Diligence and Thrift
    *   [“Rise at dawn to sweep the courtyard, ensuring cleanliness both inside and out; retire at dusk, personally checking and locking the doors. When consuming a single bowl of porridge or a single meal, contemplate the difficulty in its provision; when using half a thread or sliver of fabric, always remember the effort and resources that went into its creation.”]
*   **Lecture 3:** Long-term Vision for Lifelong Happiness; Non-attachment to External Things for Inner Joy

Do not build luxurious houses; do not seek fertile land.”]

*   **Lecture 11:** Prioritizing Righteousness Over Profit, True Blessings Reside Within
    *   [“Brothers, uncles, and nephews should share more with those who have less; those older and younger, and within and without the family, should adhere to proper etiquette. A man who listens to his wife and is unkind to his own family is not a true man; one who values wealth over parents is not a true son.”]
*   **Lecture 12:** Grasping the Fundamentals of Being Human

*   **Lecture 27:** Courageously Facing Yourself; Be Aware of the Consequences of Evil Thoughts
    *   [“Bad deeds feared to be known by others are true evil. When seeing beauty, if lustful thoughts arise, retribution will fall upon your wife and daughter.”]

Accept one's fate with contentment, and listen to heaven's will. If one conducts themselves in this way, they are likely to be virtuous.”]

**Lecture 1: Title Explanation**

Respected elders and friends, greetings to you all! The *Doctrine of the Mean* states, "When a country is about to prosper, there will be auspicious signs." When a country or nation is about to flourish, we see many positive omens. As we study traditional Chinese culture together, it contains five thousand years of wisdom, experience, methods, and concepts, along with demonstrable results, which have produced sages throughout the generations. This invaluable wisdom, if we truly accept and delve into it, will not only benefit ourselves but also our future generations, enabling them to build their lives upon a foundation of five thousand years of accumulated wisdom.

Indeed, if we observe the current era with a calm mind, we will notice that without the teachings of the classics, people tend to become very lost. Without the guidance of the classics, people do not know their direction in life, nor what they are busy with. Some may work for decades, only to find their worries and family problems compounding, without any solutions in sight. However, if a person has a sense of responsibility for their family, and is sincere in their heart, they will find resonance with the wisdom of the ancestors, as our ancestors are always protecting us from the unseen realm.

At the beginning of this year, on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, our esteemed teacher arrived in Malaysia, a visit which our Malaysian compatriots recognized as a special and auspicious occasion. Furthermore, and more importantly, our Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib, personally visited Hong Kong in early January to seek our teacher's wisdom on governance. It is deeply moving to see the head of a nation so close to a wise and benevolent leader – such respect and reverence is not easily found. The Prime Minister sought our teacher’s guidance on how to best manage Malaysia. Our teacher replied, "If you do well in 'education,' you can govern your country well." Prime Minister Najib also invited our teacher to lecture in Malaysia for a month. The Prime Minister's understanding of our teacher's teachings and the value of traditional culture is truly inspiring, a testament to the fact that he is someone who deeply understands and appreciates our teacher’s wisdom. Our teacher gladly accepted the invitation. Moreover, our teacher had a meeting with the Prime Minister and his wife, during which they discussed the wisdom of governing a country and the importance of moral education. The Prime Minister's wife was so pleased with their discussions that she requested that our teacher share these teachings with the entire population. This is truly commendable. This request by our Prime Minister's wife can potentially benefit millions of families. Therefore, there have been two interviews with our teacher recently on the "What do you say?" program and also on "8TV". This is a blessing for the Malaysian people. Why are there such great blessings? Because the Prime Minister cherishes traditional Chinese culture. So, when the head of a nation cherishes the wisdom of our ancestors, the entire population benefits. This reminds us of the Qing dynasty, and how it achieved a prosperous period of 150 years. It was not complicated. The emperors of that time, such as Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong, led by example in studying the teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism with their families, including their concubines, children, and officials. They themselves sat at the very front, setting an example for all. Therefore, although the Qing dynasty was ruled by the Manchu people, a minority ethnic group, they were able to achieve a 150-year period of prosperity, even surpassing the "Rule of Zhenguan" and the "Reign of Wen and Jing" of the Han dynasty. This is no simple achievement. Therefore, when leaders lead by example, the nation will surely prosper.

Therefore, at the beginning of this new year, we have witnessed auspicious omens in Malaysia and also in our motherland. Our national leaders lead by example in practicing thrift and avoiding wastefulness. Our President Xi Jinping advocates the "four dishes and one soup" policy, and advises government officials not to drink excessively when entertaining guests. I have heard it said that some may spend tens of thousands of dollars on alcohol in a single evening. Alcohol can be very important for medicinal purposes, but it should not be consumed just for the sake of drinking. This is a waste because so much effort is involved in making even one drop of alcohol. At a time when so many people are living in hunger, or even facing starvation, we should not be spending so much money on extravagant items. This is not what our ancestors taught us. Instead, we should have a heart that embodies the spirit of "feeling hunger as others do" and "feeling the pain of others as our own". We should refrain from purchasing such expensive items, and instead use the money we save to help people who are in crisis and poverty.

President Xi has taken the lead by residing in three-star hotels when on business trips. Those who offer four- or five-star hotels may feel discouraged now, as people may not choose to stay there. However, they can simply reduce the number of stars. As long as they provide enthusiastic service, and remember the teaching of our ancestors on providing good quality at an affordable price. In all industries, the aim is to provide service. Where does the joy of a trade lie? It is not the joy of earning excessive wealth, which is merely a desire that will become a bottomless pit, but it is in truly helping people, and winning the respect of others through our service. This is where true joy lies! Therefore, the goal of life is to serve others. Why are people in all industries not happy? Because we have lost the true purpose of our work.

For example, if we are teachers in school, where does our joy lie? Our joy is to witness the growth and development of our students, which is a lifelong satisfaction. If a teacher’s goal is to earn a higher salary or to make extra money through tutoring, they will not experience the true joy of teaching. One must find the true joy of life, or else one will feel increasingly empty and helpless. Similarly, for doctors, their goal is to rescue the dying and heal the wounded. They experience joy in saving a life, knowing they have released a family from fear and sorrow, while helping a family retain someone who can hold them together. They find that being able to save a person is a life that is worth living. If hospitals focus on yearly revenue quotas, of billions or tens of billions, are the doctors truly happy? I believe that these doctors may eventually become confused about the true value of their profession. So, we realize that without the guidance of the classics, many principles of life remain elusive.

Earlier we mentioned President Xi leading by example in being frugal, and our esteemed teacher even responded by adopting a "four dishes and one soup" meal during the new year celebrations. With President Xi’s example, how much money do you think we are saving our nation's citizens each day? It is very gratifying to see that our motherland is on the path to a cultural revival, led by President Xi. This is truly a sign that our entire nation is on the path to prosperity. Furthermore, President Xi is mindful of not disturbing the ordinary people when he travels around the country, and he maintains a very low profile. In these small details, he shows great consideration for the people. Therefore, Malaysia and China have great hope, and I also see hope in all the elders and friends here. Because it is the beginning of the New Year, and today is the first day of our course on "Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management," with so many people participating, it signifies that all the elders and friends here will set a good example to guide your families, communities, and workplaces to delve deeply into traditional culture to revive it. Our teacher has a famous saying: "A harmonious society starts with the heart, starts with one's own heart, starts from one's own home, starts from one's community, starts from one's workplace, and starts from one's own hometown."

All of these are good beginnings, but we must strive to maintain them. A good start is half of success. A good start must be coupled with persistence to be maintained. Therefore, diligence is not just about being proactive for a short time, but rather maintaining diligence throughout one's entire life. Our ancient sages also remind us, "It is easy to start, but difficult to persevere." Therefore, the ambition and eagerness to learn that we possess must be maintained and constantly improved, aiming for daily growth.

Of course, today, as we come together for our first lesson on "Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management," it is important to remember that the aim of our learning must be “to establish one’s aspiration as the most important thing”. This aspiration will become the driving force of our learning. What aspiration should we establish? Firstly, “managing a family” means being able to pass down our family lineage. This is something that we owe to our ancestors. "Connecting the past and the future" is the duty of each of us. If we fail to do this, we are culpable. We must fulfill our own responsibilities. We must aspire to revitalize our family lineage from our generation onwards.

In addition to establishing this goal for our own family, we should also establish a goal for our nation. The revival of Chinese culture begins with us being a good example, and with our families being good examples. Why is it so important to be a good example? Because in order to learn the teachings of sages, we must have faith, understanding, action, and realization. If one has faith, they will delve into the teachings of the classics, and after understanding them, they will put them into practice. Finally, this "realization" is where we will attain insights, elevate our state of being, and gain wisdom, ultimately attaining the realm of the sages. “Faith” comes first. If we do not believe, how can we learn? Therefore, faith is the most important thing in this era. If we think that traditional Chinese culture is something that is outdated, we will not be able to explore it deeply.

Yesterday, our teacher was interviewed, with the topic of whether the ancient wisdom could solve the current social problems. If this question is not answered, then it will be impossible to delve deeply into the teachings. Therefore, our teacher stated an important point, which is that the hearts of the ancients were purer than ours. Because their hearts were pure, they were able to generate wisdom, and they were able to see things with great depth and clarity. If our hearts are not pure and have many desires and worries, then we can only think in the short term. When our desires grow, we become blinded by these desires, and our minds become clouded with material gain. We can no longer see things in the long term. Therefore, if we pause and think, who has a purer mind, us or the ancients?

Zhuge Liang said, "Be detached in order to establish one's aspiration, and be tranquil in order to achieve greater things." If our children have very strong desires, how can they have a great aspiration? If one only wants to play computer games for three days without sleeping, how can he have any ambition? He only thinks about satisfying his own desires, and he will have no ambition. Therefore, it is important to have a clear mind and minimal desires in order to have a lofty aspiration. If we cannot calm our hearts, how can we think deeply?

If we calmly analyze the current social conditions, we can see the lack of tranquility and how our understanding of things is very superficial, as we are unable to see the root causes. As the *Great Learning* says, "Virtue is the root, and wealth is the branches." Virtue is fundamental, while wealth is secondary. If we think carefully, do most countries prioritize moral education, or do they prioritize the economy? Isn't it true that countries place the secondary before the fundamental? Thus, what they are thinking is knowledge, not wisdom.

Let’s take another example: people today think that the economy is most important. An economist who has won the Nobel Prize once stated, "The sole purpose of a business is to make profit." This statement has been in university textbooks for the past 100 to 200 years. Is this knowledge or wisdom? Wisdom is a truth that has been verified over thousands of years and remains unchanged. Many things in our textbooks are ideas that have been created by people in recent times, which may very well be incorrect. There are many economic experts, but how big is the global economic crisis? How did our ancestors teach us to use money? They said, "live within your means" -- this is wisdom. But if we think about how people are taught to use money in this era? "Just swipe," and they have more than one credit card. If you go to a university campus, you will see students opening their wallets, and there might be an average of three or more credit cards. Do they have the knowledge of how to use credit cards? Yes. They can calculate the interest rates, and they compare the options. Where is their cleverness used? It is used to ensure that they do not max out their credit cards. But they will eventually be maxed out. Because they have not worked on improving themselves, they have not improved their self-control, and thus problems will occur.

If we teach children this way, how will the next generation not overspend? Therefore, there are many "moonlight goddesses" in the next generation who spend everything they earn every month. These "moonlight goddesses" have studied for ten or twenty years, and have much knowledge, but may not possess wisdom. Their desires grow more and more, and their wisdom is completely covered. Desires cloud their minds. If we look at the current social phenomena and we think about what the ancients have said, including "Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management", as we examine it today, we must admire the ancients and be grateful for their compassion, in handing down such wisdom from generation to generation to us.

Alright, after having established our aspirations, for our family, for our nation, and as a member of the Chinese nation, we should be thinking about all of mankind. Those who are not thinking about all of mankind are not acting like a member of the Chinese nation. In the teachings of sages, we emphasize substance over form. What is the substance of being a member of the Chinese nation? Is it having yellow skin, or is it having a heart that resonates with the heart of our ancestors? It is not just about skin color, nor is it about the blood that runs through our veins, but it is about having thoughts and ideas that resonate with our ancestors. If our ideas contradict those of our ancestors, then we are not acting like members of the Chinese nation.

If we look at the teachings of our ancestors in the *Great Learning* and in the other classics, they all taught us to think about all of mankind. The *Great Learning* states, "Those in ancient times who wished to spread their virtues to the world", were always thinking about the benefit of the world when they considered matters. Why is our planet so damaged? Because people only think of themselves, and not of others, nor of future generations. If we stop and think, are there any guarantees that the future generations will have a good environment to live in? Our ancestors always sought to leave good wisdom and a good living environment to their future generations, but how has it come to pass that it is this generation that is destroying the environment? If we continue on this path, we are not only not worthy of being a member of the Chinese nation, but we are not even worthy of being parents or elders. We should think of the future generations in order to act like an elder, and we should not just have the name of an elder without fulfilling our responsibilities.

After establishing our goals, our attitude towards learning is very important. Chinese culture is an internal learning, which means that we must work on ourselves, rather than making demands of others or pointing out their shortcomings. We should start with this understanding and attitude. If we do not have this attitude, then we will not be able to calm our minds when we study. For example, if we are reading a classic which says, "Rise at dawn," then we might say to ourselves that our daughter-in-law is always getting up late. Or, if it says, "Sweep the courtyard," then we might say our son never sweeps the floor. Or if it says, “Keep the interior and exterior tidy,” then we might be thinking about how untidy our daughter’s room is. As you can see, when we are reading these passages, our minds are often pointing the finger outwards, and making demands of others. If we continue learning in this way, we will find that when we return home, our whole family may close the doors in response, as if the police are coming.

Therefore, we must first look within. The Taoist classic, *Treatise on Action and Response*, teaches us: “Correct yourself, and then influence others.” When we conduct ourselves well, we will naturally influence those around us, rather than making demands of them. As long as we have the intention to make demands of others, the desire to control others in our hearts will not diminish. It is very subtle.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and fluency, while maintaining the tone and intention of the original speaker:

**Translation:**

Therefore, this inner practice of cultivating the mind, "only involves silently cleansing the depths of our heart's source," is very subtle. If we don't truly and authentically observe our own thoughts, we likely won't notice them, and may even deceive ourselves. People might say, "You seem a bit angry," and we'll retort, "I'm not! I'm not!" Then there's no hope. When someone offers a gentle reminder, and we don't acknowledge it, they won't dare remind us again.

Therefore, firstly, regarding this mindset for internal cultivation, the classics also teach us, "When your actions do not meet expectations, seek the cause within yourself." If this attitude is not established, the more we study the teachings of the sages, the more afflictions we will have, because we'll be demanding things of others. When others don't listen to us, we suffer from unfulfilled desires. And it's not just we ourselves who suffer, everyone around us will suffer, and feel a great deal of pressure. The teachings of the sages should be like a gentle breeze, not something that makes people feel pressured. If the people around us are feeling increasingly pressured, then it means we ourselves have learned it wrongly.  The result of our learning should be our family members saying, "Since my husband started studying traditional culture, he's been so good to me, so considerate," and then going around promoting the teachings of the sages. That is to glorify the sages, a good demonstration, doing it right.

Furthermore, in our study of the teachings of the sages, "learning values practice."  We should put each phrase we learn into action. If we don't have this attitude, then every verse of scripture is just knowledge.  We might have read it, we might have memorized it, but without integrating knowledge and action, we can't benefit from it ourselves.  Not only will we not benefit ourselves, but our arrogance will grow.  The *Standards for Being a Good Student* says, "If one doesn't practice what they learn, but only pursues knowledge, their vanity will increase and what kind of person will they become?”  Sometimes after reading these things, we can even lecture others. When others are reading, we might say, "I know it too, let me recite it for you," showing off. We're afraid others don't know how much we've memorized. That "increased vanity" grows imperceptibly.

Therefore, the venerable Master often mentions that what Teacher Li Bingnan said, is we cannot toy with the teachings of the sages, we cannot treat them as amusement. What does it mean to treat them as amusement? To recite them so that others think we're refined, but without truly putting a single word into practice. This becomes playing around, and we gain no real benefit. Therefore, let's adopt an attitude today, to immediately act on what we learn, okay? Good. Let's tick this box, and remind each other. The camera is recording you all, “Of all speech, sincerity is paramount.” You've all joined the pirate ship—no, you’ve embarked on the great ship of the sages, heading towards a life of happiness and fulfillment! So, for example, if the first thing we said today is “Awake at dawn,” then tomorrow we must wake up early. Is anyone thinking, "Oh no, I shouldn't have said 'good' just now, let me have a few days' grace period.”  Of course, you don’t need to feel pressured, because when studying the teachings of the sages, no one can be there constantly reminding us, so self-reminders are the most important.

In the process of learning, the teachings of the sages especially emphasize “grasping the root.” A noble person must focus on the root.  Today we are studying family precepts, in order to govern the family. What is the “root”? “To govern one's family well, one must first cultivate oneself.”  When we have found the root, it's like cultivating plants. We definitely fertilize and water the roots, not by pouring water on the leaves, or soaking the leaves in water, it's useless. We must grasp the “root” by cultivating ourselves. So, today we are parents, and we want to educate our children. What is the root? Self-education is the root. If we are leaders, parents, or teachers, and we can't educate ourselves, then we can't possibly educate our subordinates, our children, or our students. Therefore, this concept, our ancestors taught us to “focus on the root,” to start with ourselves, this is extremely important.

First, let's look at the title:

**[Zhu Zi's Family Maxims]**

Zhu Zi refers to Mr. Zhu Bailu, who lived at the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty. He was also known as Zhu Yongchun, with the courtesy name Zhichi. His father was very learned and later became an official. Unfortunately, he died defending against the Qing army during the late Ming Dynasty. Mr. Zhu Bailu, though a brilliant scholar himself, had great integrity and was unwilling to serve the foreign invaders. Especially since his father died in battle against the Qing, he chose to remain in seclusion as a recluse his entire life.  Scholars have two paths: one is to become an official, using the teachings of the sages to govern the people and be a good public servant; the other, if conditions are not ripe, is to live in seclusion, as a hermit.

We might think that living in seclusion offers no benefit to the country or society. But actually, these hermits often have great ability, virtue, and wisdom. They choose not to come forward, setting a great example of valuing integrity. Also, they do not compete for fame or fortune. Although they have the ability to compete, they choose not to. In fact, if the whole world were to emulate this lack of competition, society would become stable and peaceful. Moreover, they would continuously improve their own morals and knowledge, and engage in education, producing many outstanding students, who would then make great contributions to their families, society, and the nation. And we can see that Mr. Zhu Bailu also left us *Lectures on the Four Books.* His understanding of the Four Books is very deep. Those who study the Four Books can find great enlightenment through his life of dedicated practice. That also includes the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, benefiting countless families and people. We are only studying them together today, yet many of these phrases are extremely familiar to us: “A single bowl of porridge or a single grain of rice, always remember its difficult origins,” “Though our ancestors are far away, our sacrificial offerings to them should be sincere.” These phrases we know so well. This shows us that through his dedication and deep immersion in the classics, his benefit to future generations is immeasurable!

So we cannot think that if one becomes an official their contribution must be greater, and if they don’t become an official their contribution is lesser. We cannot look at it this way. Actually, there is a reason for every scholar’s decision to advance or retreat, and we should not focus on their outward appearance, but rather on their intent. Because each person's circumstances are different, the way they manifest will also be different. For example, Zheng Xuan of the late Han Dynasty was an outstanding scholar. At the time, the Han Dynasty was in turmoil, and there was no enlightened ruler for him to serve. He deeply studied the Five Classics and ended up providing excellent commentaries on the Five Classics and the Thirteen Classics, benefiting future generations.  Of course, there were also those who became officials during those troubled times, but one cannot look at them and say, "Hmph, just seeking fame and fortune, a lackey."  For example, if they were to serve another ethnicity, we couldn’t call them a lackey. We cannot judge by outward appearances.

For example, Yelü Chucai, was from the Liao Dynasty, but he deeply studied traditional Chinese culture and served Genghis Khan of the Yuan Dynasty. Because the ancients understood the opportune time, he knew that the Song Dynasty’s fate was exhausted, and the Yuan Dynasty was established, and this could not be changed.  But, the Yuan Dynasty was founded by the Mongols, who were nomads and skilled in martial arts. If they had not had Chinese culture to guide and influence them, how many lives and common people would they have slaughtered? So, Yelü Chucai, in accordance with the circumstances, without seeking fame or fortune, assisted Genghis Khan, constantly advising him to abstain from killing, pointing out that Heaven values life. How many people did he benefit?  Just speaking of the siege of Bianjing (Kaifeng) by the Yuan army, they had been attacking for a long time without being able to conquer it.  Finally, the general was so enraged that he decided that upon entering the city, he would kill all of the inhabitants – a complete massacre. Yelü Chucai quickly advised Genghis Khan, and finally he issued an order to not commit any indiscriminate killings, saving the lives of 1.47 million people. So, the decision of these scholars to advance or retreat provide great inspiration for us.

We are not currently in a war, and we do not lack material comforts, but the lack of spiritual fulfillment is the most serious it has been in the past five thousand years. People's thoughts and ideas are skewed, and their hearts lack purpose. Now is the great era of cultural revival, and we have all encountered this era. Professor Toynbee also said, "The only way to solve the social problems of the 21st century is through Confucianism and Mahayana Buddhism." After hearing these words, does everyone feel that their lives are different?  Some hear with their ears, and some hear with their hearts, and it’s not the same.  If one hears these words with their heart, they will be awakened and enlightened, and suddenly think, "Ah, I finally understand why I was born!"  If one hears these words with their heart, they can attain enlightenment. Many people spend their entire lives wondering, "What am I supposed to be doing in this world? Am I just supposed to eat, sleep, eat again, then work to get a paycheck, and just let my life pass by day after day?”

I heard an elder say the other day that life seems to pass by so quickly after the age of forty. Hearing that, I felt a chill, because I just turned forty this year, and it made me think, am I about to get on a roller coaster? That one, two, three years would pass by in an instant?  So the ancients were compassionate, setting examples for us, reminding us that not even an ounce of gold can buy back an inch of time, so we must cherish our spiritual time, and not waste it away. The Venerable Master also said that human life is only a few decades, we should always do something meaningful, and not come into this world in vain. Now, not only are we coming in vain, but more seriously our spirit is rapidly declining. I’d ask everyone, was our moral character better when we were in elementary school, or now? We didn’t run red lights when we were in elementary school, but what about now?  We used to say "My dad said" and "My mom said", but what do we say now? "What *I* say."  We were pure then, but what about now? I’m certainly not as pure. So think about it, life should be a continuous progression of increasing our wisdom and spirit, and not a decline of our spirit, we're on the wrong path if that is the case.

Earlier we mentioned, to solve the social problems of the 21st century, we must rely on Confucianism (the Confucian school of thought), and Mahayana Buddhism (the Buddhist school of thought), which is Chinese culture.  In other words, saving this world depends on Chinese culture. Now, where is Chinese culture? I'm waiting for someone to confidently declare, "It's here with me!"  "A scholar must be resolute and strong, his task is heavy and his journey is long," we are the children of China, we understand the teachings of our ancestors, but other ethnicities don't.  Now the only solution to save this world is Chinese culture. And we are Chinese people, so haven’t we already understood what we are here in this world to do? This is called “seeing the right and acting bravely." This is the righteousness and duty that we should fulfill to our compatriots, and all the people in the world. We can't just watch the world go to its destruction, can we? So we must see the right and act bravely, this is what Confucius taught.  Of course, we must take responsibility when it is required, it is not fulfilling our duty if we don't. The saying "to see a person in danger and not help", is "to see righteousness but not act,” is a “lack of courage.” Isn’t that right? Indeed, “to see the right and not act is to lack courage," it's a sin to not save someone in need. Therefore, there is no turning back, we can only move forward.

In fact, where does true happiness in life lie? Mencius said it so clearly: "When looking up to Heaven, we feel no shame, when looking down at people, we feel no embarrassment." This means to have a clear conscience. Only such a person can taste true joy in life. If there are many things that we should do, and we do not do them, and we just continue to seek fame and fortune, then our conscience will be uneasy. In reality, many people may be powerful and very busy, but they haven’t taught their children well, or been filial to their parents, I believe at night, when all is quiet, their hearts will be extremely empty. Therefore, true joy definitely comes from the conscience. Having a clear conscience and feeling no shame in oneself, this is joy that comes from within.

As we walk on this path, in this great era of promoting culture, we can choose to engage in teaching, in support, or we can choose to set a good example in our own workplace. Everyone's circumstances are different. We who have already chosen to promote culture, that is also a particular circumstance. It doesn't mean we are superior, or that we have learned more than others. In fact, those of us who are promoting culture are in greater danger, like myself. Why? Because of the burden of fame. After becoming well-known, "people fear fame as pigs fear fatness.” Many people will offer praise, but honestly, that praise is usually way over the degree of our true abilities. Like nine years ago, I had the opportunity to go to Haikou. At the time, my knowledge of the classics was far from sufficient, but the circumstances matured, and I started sharing. If we aren't careful, we can lose ourselves in praise and applause. So even though I have the chance to share with you, I am very likely in a dangerous situation myself, and I should remind myself to be unattached.

Okay, Mr. Zhu Bailu's morality and knowledge have been passed down for hundreds of years, and he is our role model. We can learn from him. Next, *Family Maxims*, to "govern the family," how do we govern a family well? Start with self-cultivation, from the investigation of things, from our own moral character. Next, the concrete starting point, to eliminate desires, to eliminate bad habits. This "eliminate," in the phrase "investigation of things," is the meaning of eliminating and confronting. Here, it has another meaning. "Maxims" this "maxim" refers to standards, is a method, that everyone follows, a standard. It is essentially the unchanging way of how to conduct oneself, called "maxims." So when we understand family maxims, we start by working on our hearts and minds, and won’t be in the mode of demanding things of others.

Let's look at the first sentence which says:

**[Awake at dawn. Sweep and clean the courtyard. Keep inside and outside neat and tidy.]**

Actually these phrases, each time we recite them, we will feel that the ancients, in each phrase and each word, the meaning is very profound, we should not underestimate any single word. For example, in *Standards for Being a Good Student,* there's a sentence that says, "When parents scold, we must obey." "Scold," means to scold, to punish us, we must "obey". "Obey" means that we must follow and not disobey, even if our parents are scolding us because they misunderstand, or even when they're angry, we shouldn't explain or argue. There's a possibility that would make our parents even angrier. We should obey if they are right, and obey even when they’ve misunderstood us. In the old days, if parents punished them rightly, they would go and fetch the stick for their parents to beat them with. Also, after obeying, they had to "accept".  We cannot let our parents have lectured us in vain. After they teach us, we should not repeat those mistakes again and remember that lesson. Otherwise, if they scold us once, and we keep repeating that same mistake, aren’t we depleting our parents’ energy and spirit? So every word of that is heart-method.

Let’s look at "Awake at dawn."  "Dawn," is in the morning. What does it represent? From the aspect of action, we need to get up early. From the aspect of the mind, it's that we have a regulated life.  Learning the teachings of the sages is an inner study, we must follow the rules. Only with precepts can we achieve samadhi. Think about it, are people who sleep late and wake up late able to have samadhi?  They can't even wake up after the alarm goes off three or five times. When they finally get up, things are always being dropped and clattering, because they're in a rush. So these rules of life are part of the precepts. Only by following precepts can we attain samadhi, and only through samadhi can we open our wisdom.

Therefore, in learning the teachings of the sages, we must first learn the rules. Where are the rules? We can say that every word and action we do each day are rules. Waking up early is a rule, and waking up early is also filial piety. Does waking up early have anything to do with filial piety? Yes, it does. “If the body is harmed, our parents will worry." "Our body, hair, and skin are given to us by our parents".  If someone does not get up early, it means they are going to sleep late. When we stay up late and lose sleep for a few days, it's difficult for us to recover. How can we take this body that our parents gave us, the body that they have worked so hard to raise, and waste it? Moreover, will our parents worry when they see this? Definitely worried, so we've been lacking in filial piety. The root of this virtue is not whole. Also, waking up early is studying the way, which is following the way of nature. The universe has its order, “rise when the sun rises, and rest when the sun sets.” We shouldn’t go against nature and Heaven. Then there's no way to cultivate the way. If a person can wake up early, they will have more time in their day, their time will be abundant, and the whole of their life, and daily schedule, won’t be so chaotic.

Mr. Zeng Guofan also talked about how to tell if a family will prosper, by looking at three things: First, at what time do the descendants wake up? Second, do his descendants do housework? Third, do his descendants read the teachings of the sages? From these three points, we can tell. Mr. Zeng Guofan's judgement on whether a family is prosperous just happens to mention that here, “sweep and clean the courtyard,” this is diligently doing housework.

Okay, "Awake at dawn," getting up early is also self-love, and is beneficial to our health. And people who wake up early have a plan for their day, so the way they schedule things will be stable, and their ability to work will also improve. So from the heart’s perspective, viewing the teachings of the sages, each teaching can actually inspire a great many good roots. When we understand from this perspective, our faith in the teachings will become very strong, we won’t doubt them, and we will hurry to put them into action.  “Sweep and clean the courtyard,” means diligence. What influence does diligence have on a person's mind and nature? For example, if they are diligent, they will be responsible; if they are diligent, they will understand the hardships of others, and be grateful to others; if they do chores often, they can empathize with the difficulties of others. All of this comes about from the changes that diligence creates in their mind.

So, we will continue to discuss how each phrase inspires the good roots of our mind. Today, our time is up, so I’ll stop our discussion here. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here's the translation of the provided text, striving for accuracy, naturalness, and a professional tone:

**Lecture 2: The Secrets to Increasing Blessings and Changing Destiny: Diligence and Frugality**

Respected elders and friends, good day to you all! At the start of this year, the classic we are sharing is the *Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management*. From a personal perspective, carrying on the family tradition is our responsibility. From the perspective of society and nation, each family is a cell of the social and national body. When each family is stable, knows how to manage the household, and educate the next generation, our society, nation, and people will have a future.

My grand teacher, Teacher Li Bingnan, was a great scholar, a great Confucian, well-versed in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. He taught in Taiwan for thirty-eight years, with over five hundred thousand students. This elder taught until the age of ninety-seven. His spirit is deeply admired. And Teacher Li Bingnan’s teacher was Master Yin Guang, from the early years of the Republic of China. In the thousands of years of Chinese history, Buddhist monks had to achieve a level of morality and learning comparable to a *jinshi* (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations), and they also had to pass the national examination to obtain the qualification for ordination – the *du die*. The Qing Dynasty emperors were all Buddhist students. The year before last, while I was in Taiwan, there was a special exhibition at the National Palace Museum. Among the Qing Dynasty artifacts on display, I was very surprised to see that the Qing emperors’ hats had a Buddha statue right in the center. From this artifact, we can understand that the Qing emperors were good disciples and students of Buddhism. By placing the Buddha statue in the very center of their hats, they were reminding themselves that they should never forget the Buddha's teachings. Therefore, both Buddhism and Taoism are very good forms of education. Master Yin Guang had a great impact on society during the Republic of China. Many government officials were his students. At that time, facing a general decline in ethics and morality, the Master said: "To save this world, everyone must understand cause and effect and every family must have an education." Only then can we reverse the decline of society.

May I ask all of you elders and friends, do you believe that society will get better and better? This question should be phrased like this: Before you encountered traditional culture, who believed that society would get better and better? Please raise your hand. If you raise your hand, your personality is that of an optimist, naturally optimistic. Otherwise, in our growing-up process, this society has become increasingly chaotic. When I teach in school, my actual feeling is that each generation is not as good as the last, the quality of the students is declining year by year. If it continues to decline at this rate, will you feel at ease when the future of society is handed over to these children? You won't feel at ease. So people become more and more anxious and depressed, worrying about society, worrying about their children having problems.

Therefore, Master Yin Guang’s statement “everyone should understand cause and effect and every family should have an education” is very insightful. And through our joint learning of *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Family Management*, we can ensure that each family will have a family education. Moreover, *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Family Management* in reality, is closely related to cause and effect in every single sentence. In fact, all the things in this world cannot be separated from the principle of cause and effect. May I ask everyone, you sitting here listening to this lecture now is a result. What was the cause? Has anyone said, "I just got drunk and accidentally wandered in here"? No, right? It's because we know that traditional culture is good. It's because we have a mission to educate our children well and to carry on the family tradition. This cause leads to this result. Then everyone sitting here is a result, but also a cause. So, cause and effect is continuous. Today, if everyone understands a sentence, it is a cause, and changing your family's destiny is the result. So when is cause and effect? Anytime, anywhere! Now is the result, and this result is the beginning of another cause. Therefore, people who truly understand cause and effect will surely be able to change their future. If you study hard today, you will have wisdom tomorrow. Confucius said, “Loving to learn is close to wisdom.” You will get closer and closer to wisdom.

Every sentence in *Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management* also embodies cause and effect. And some of the cause and effect in these sentences should make us very cautious. For example, when everyone was chanting the text earlier, did you chant, “A family built on harshness will not endure”? When an elder is harsh, their family will soon decline, and the wealth that comes from harshness cannot be kept. Because they are so harsh, the children and grandchildren they teach will be even more harsh. “Those above who have certain preferences, those below will often do even more.” What we like and our habits may be learned even more strongly by the next generation. If we are harsh, they will be even more harsh; if we like to gamble, they will like to gamble even more. Then it’s over. So this is karmic retribution.

Another example is, “Violating moral principles will lead to immediate downfall.” If brothers quarrel, if husband and wife quarrel, if father and son quarrel, this family will definitely decline. I heard that there was a very wealthy family in Penang, and it seems that all the local Chinese knew this family. As a result, the son sued his mother. This is a sign of decline. Later, after studying the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, he quickly repented to his mother. I heard that their business is now doing quite well. So when people correct their mistakes and start anew, their destiny will get better and better.

Moreover, the promotion of traditional culture, *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* is very well done in Penang. There is a school called Chung Ling High School. The principal of this independent school, Principal Wu Weicheng, is wholeheartedly devoted to supporting the revival of traditional culture. He has lent out his classrooms, and the teachers are all selflessly volunteering. Every week, more than a thousand people attend classes at his school, and they are not his students, but the public. Does this school have blessings? Besides educating their own children well, they also educate people for the benefit of the greater society. This school will continue to thrive, accumulating great merit. They could have left the classrooms empty when on break or in the evening, so why not contribute it to the public! And in fact, because of his selfless heart, he has attracted many dedicated volunteers. So the relationships between people are all interconnected, his selflessness has attracted many people to help his school and help him do this work of educating the public. The fact that this entrepreneur in Penang has turned back is greatly related to the education that is taking place locally. In fact, preventing even one family from breaking up is a great deed, not to mention long-term education which has unknowingly saved many families.

Therefore, this is another example of cause and effect, "In family life, abstain from disputes and lawsuits." A family should never take each other to court. When fathers and sons, brothers sue each other in court, it is very ugly, and the next generation cannot be educated well. As long as you go to court, it’s a sign of bad luck. Please pay attention to the news. Many entrepreneurs, as soon as they die, their children start fighting over the inheritance. Some haven't even been buried a year or two after death because the family cannot agree on how to distribute the wealth. When a family is harmonious, everything prospers. When family members quarrel, the family will definitely decline. So these cause-and-effect relationships are very enlightening for our lives.

"In dealing with the world, be cautious of speaking too much, for speaking too much often leads to mistakes." People who talk too much and speak without considering the situation, will definitely make mistakes and offend others. Also mentioned later, “Those who let lust arise at the sight of beauty, the consequences will fall upon his wife and daughters.” People's thoughts also create sinful karma. Often having lustful thoughts may bring disaster on your descendants and befall your own wife and daughters. "Those who harbor resentment and use hidden arrows, disaster will befall their descendants." People in their dealings with the world, often harbor resentment toward others, even taking opportunities to frame them, disaster will befall their descendants. From history, we see that those who seize power and harm loyal people, their end result is that their entire family is executed and their lineage is extinguished. Therefore, such things should absolutely not be done. *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Family Management* allows everyone to understand cause and effect and at the same time allows every family to know how to educate the next generation. With proper education, every family will produce sages and worthies.

Educating daughters is even more important than educating sons! Why? Because all the talents are taught by mothers. From childhood, parents should educate their daughters well, and in the future, she will be a good wife and a good mother. Therefore, educating daughters well can bring peace to the world. So, parents, who here have daughters? Please raise your hands. You are all here to save the world. If they educate their daughters well, many sages and worthies will emerge. Therefore, there must be professional ethics in educating daughters, they must be educated well. I once heard someone complain, "Oh, my daughter is not young anymore, and her temper is so bad. I need to marry her off quickly, otherwise, she'll make me angry every day." This attitude lacks professional ethics, right? How can you want to marry your daughter off just because her temper is bad? Instead of putting yourself in the other party's shoes, you just cause trouble for others. This is a disservice to your merit. When a daughter marries into another family and helps that family prosper, the parents accumulate the greatest merit. Raising daughters accumulates great merit. So now is not the time to be eager to marry your daughters off. You should first educate your daughter well, and only then can you marry her off. That's the proper way to be, that is the heart we should have, putting ourselves in others' shoes and being tolerant.

Although that's the principle, it's not always followed in practice. For example, there were two old ladies chatting. One of the old ladies said, "Oh, my life is so bad. That new daughter-in-law takes all the good things back to her own family. I am so unlucky!" She was crying there. The other old lady said, "Oh, don't be sad, don't be sad." Patting her back, comforting her. Then this old lady asked the other party, "My old friend, how have you been lately?" "I've been very well recently. After my daughter got married, she sends all the good things back to our house.” When something happens to oneself, you feel unlucky. But if the good things go to your own home, then it feels good. You don't consider the other side's family. So our ancestors left us with a saying, "Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto you." This is very important.

Not only must you educate your daughters well, if children are well-educated, wherever they go, they will bring joy and wisdom to others. If children are not well-educated, wherever they go, they will create trouble and bring trouble to society and the nation. Therefore, educating one's own children well is the duty of every parent, and only then can they have a clear conscience.

In our last lecture, we shared the first sentence:
【Rise early at dawn. Sweep and clean the courtyard. Strive to maintain cleanliness both inside and out.】

We also shared in the last lecture that in learning traditional culture, one must be determined. We have already made our aspirations clear: for the sake of our nation, for the sake of our families. Furthermore, the value of learning lies in practice. So after learning the first sentence, may I ask everyone, did you get up early this week? Furthermore, after getting up early, did you clean your house? So whether your learning is beneficial depends on your level of practice. Also, our ancestors said, "Reading books is valuable for changing your temperament." Reading books will change your temperament, because after reading and understanding the principles, you will act on them. After you act on them, your mindset will change. Once your mindset changes, your appearance will change accordingly, and your temperament will change. Therefore, the essence of learning lies in the effort in one's heart.

Let's look at “Rise early at dawn,” which is getting up early. It’s an action, but what’s its impact on one's inner self? When one rises early, one understands how to be invigorated, how to be self-reliant, how to cherish time, and how not to waste time. One's inner nature begins to change, and one understands how to break through the habit of laziness. Our ancestors left us *The Book of Changes*, which contains sixty-four hexagrams. The first hexagram is called *Qian*, representing heavenly virtues. The spirit of the *Qian* hexagram, as it is explained in *The Book of Changes*, is, “The movement of Heaven is full of power. Therefore, the noble man makes himself strong and untiring.” “Power” means strong, very active, proactive, and energetic. Moreover, this “power” also implies perseverance. Cultivating this good habit will last a lifetime. Setting this aspiration will last a lifetime. This is being untiringly self-strengthening.

Let’s look at each line from a positive and negative perspective. If a child does not get up early, sleeps late, and then gets up late the next day, they will ruin their health. Their body and mind will be damaged. Also, a person who sleeps very late is very listless and lazy. The difference is very great. So Mr. Zeng Guofan said, "Sleeping in late" – sleeping in late means getting up late – "is a terrible vice that leads to family ruin." It’s a bad behavior. This behavior of getting up late will surely lead to the ruin of the family. Mr. Zeng Guofan also said – his family was very well-managed. After several hundred years, his family is still producing many outstanding people in this era. It’s not easy. His words can give us great inspiration – “Managing a family is fundamentally based on not sleeping in late.”

Therefore, when people learn the classics, they can calculate their own destiny, and they can also calculate the destiny of their family. Now if everyone calculates for a moment, is our family going to prosper or decline? Many parents after listening say, "Yes, this is very important. Tomorrow, I'll set the alarm for my children, and wake them up.” After the children get up, they go back to sleep themselves. That doesn't work. Education is very important, and parents should lead by example. Otherwise, the children will not be convinced. We have also shared the importance of getting up early with our children, and our children would say, "Mom sleeps until noon.” We don’t know what to say next, so we can only say, “Mom is too tired.” We cannot let our children lose confidence in their parents, right? Otherwise, when parents go against what teachers teach, it’s all for nothing. So now, what is said in every sentence is not to require children first, it’s to require parents and elders to first do it themselves.

Next, “Sweep and clean the courtyard." This is a very diligent habit. From the perspective of actions and deeds, it’s diligence, but from the perspective of the heart, it’s reverence. Firstly, it’s reverence towards the living environment; Secondly, it’s reverence towards one’s own attitude and lifestyle. If one is not diligent and becomes lazy, one's own physical and mental state will deteriorate. So, cultivating the habit of diligence is very important for the family, and it has a profound impact on the temperament of children. The ancestors also said, "Diligence and frugality are the foundation of managing a household.” Therefore, when managing a family, all the fundamental aspects must be grasped. And once we understand the importance of each teaching, no one would be unwilling to do it. Once you understand, and you know doing so is to love yourself and your children, you will immediately want to do it.

Let us calmly look at the influence of each teaching on people’s hearts. First, let’s look at, “Sweep and clean the courtyard,” which is diligence. “Courtyard” is the yard, “clean” is the steps, that is, the entire living environment, to clean it up. And diligence, first of all, let's look at its benefit for a person’s physical health. Does everyone think that people's health is getting worse or better? It's getting worse. How is it that even with such rich diets, the health is getting worse? First of all, there is too little exercise, no housework, and the meridians are not smooth. Often doing labor, often doing manual work, will make the body's blood flow freely. My father is stronger than me because my father is the eldest son. When they were in their teens, they worked in the fields, often carrying manure to help their parents farm. Therefore, a person who is willing to work for their parents is a blessed person. This filial piety will accumulate great blessings for themselves, not only blessings but also health.

Besides physical health, let’s look at the effect on a person’s psychology. It will foster a sense of responsibility. If something is entrusted to them, they will do it properly. Many children who help their parents a lot at home naturally help their teachers at school as well. They have a sense of responsibility. When they see that the teacher is tired, they will go and help. Of course, they will be loved by the teachers, right? They have a sense of responsibility.

Furthermore, they will have a grateful heart, because they "learn to be grateful through hard work.” After putting in hard work, they realize that many things are very hard and not easy. When they see others cooking or working, they will immediately feel grateful to the other party. The children of today do not do physical work, so when they see others sweating, they do not feel anything. They don't even know where their food comes from. *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Family Management* says, “For every grain of rice and every sip of gruel, we should think of how difficult it was to obtain them.” We once asked our children where does rice come from? They said, the kitchen. Where does the rice from the kitchen come from? Dad bought it from the supermarket. So, let me tell you, some of the answers children give today will make you fall off your chair. There was a child who wrote in a composition: “I went to my grandparents’ house and my grandfather picked a watermelon from the tree for me to eat.” This is very serious. They have rich imaginations but haven’t seen anything.

We once took our children to plant rice. The children had never seen rice plants before, and they stood there discussing: will we die if we go down there? Another child said, no, there's cement on the bottom. As a result, after the children planted rice in the fields for half a day, they returned with sore backs and aching waists. Then, the rice was especially delicious, they ate a lot, because they sweated and were very hungry. Then the teacher told them: “The rice you guys spent half a day planting has all been eaten by you at lunchtime.” They replied, “I worked so hard, and all of it was gone in one meal.” Will such children waste rice in the future? No, they won't.

Let me tell you a secret, I was twenty-five years old when I first picked up a hoe, and I went to grow vegetables. As a result, I spent about three weeks growing vegetables, growing bok choy and water spinach. I sweated for three weeks and the dishes were eaten in about one minute once they were put on the table. Many of the friends I lived with ate it all in one minute. Then they would say, “It’s very tender,” and that was it. So, after I have grown vegetables myself, as long as there are vegetables that I cannot finish eating, I will make sure to eat them all because I can’t bear to waste them. Many principles require the child to experience them personally, then they will never forget them for life. Just having them memorize it as knowledge, sometimes, they don't feel it deeply. Many times, you must take children to experience things firsthand.

Therefore, a sense of responsibility, gratitude for the efforts of others, including empathy, as long as a child has this attitude, they will have a healthy mind and very good psychological resilience. And because of these attitudes, their interpersonal relationships will be very good. They will receive the care of the teachers and the friendship of their classmates, and their interpersonal relationships will be very good. Moreover, their abilities will also continuously improve with their efforts. In fact, from here, we can gradually understand what our ancestors meant by, "Suffering a loss is a blessing." We often see that many people are very honest and are often bullied by others at work, and they are always given all the work to do. May I ask everyone, will their capabilities improve if they do more work? Yes! Furthermore, will their blessings improve? They will be more blessed. And the more they give, the more these attitudes will be developed. So the ancients were experienced, they deeply understood the principle that suffering a loss is a blessing.

On the other hand, if you teach children from a young age not to suffer any loss, what are you teaching them? To be calculative. This is wrong. There was a child, it just so happened that his classmate did not bring his lunch that day. When he saw this, he gave half of his lunch to his classmate. The child’s heart was very pure. He was also happy doing good, as the saying goes, doing good brings the greatest joy. When he got home, he told his mother excitedly, “Mom, my classmate didn’t have any lunch today, so I gave him half of mine.” As a result, his mother immediately hit his head, “You idiot! Mom works hard to make money to buy you lunch, and you give it to others!” You see, this one hit to the head has knocked down the child’s destiny. Therefore, whether a parent understands education truly determines the child’s life’s destiny.

Therefore, one should not be calculative, being calculative will bring no blessings. There was a true story about a family whose blessings were exhausted, and then disaster followed. There was a male teacher at a school, who even rose to become the school's supervisor. May I ask, does he understand education? Therefore, we cannot judge things by appearances today. He was a supervisor in school, that was his blessing, but it doesn't mean that he knows how to educate others. Does someone who is a big boss today really understand the way to earn money? Not necessarily. His ancestors may have left him a hundred million of blessings, but he doesn't know how to manage it and now only has ten million. However, we might think that he has ten million, so he must be very capable. We are judging wrongly. So in judging things, we must be insightful.

This male teacher was a supervisor at the school, and his son was a first grader at the same school. As it turned out, his son was very enthusiastic, and every time after class he would stay behind to close the windows and turn off the lights. Because his father was a school supervisor, and left later, he was the last one to leave, and then he would go to his father's office. One day, he happily checked the whole classroom and then went to his father's office. As a result, his father glared at him: “Why are you so stupid? Why is it always you doing it, why don’t others do it?” The child was stunned. First graders listen to their parents. Such young children would not think what their parents say is wrong. So he listened to his father. From that day onward, he no longer volunteered, and became very calculative. His nature began to change.

As a result, in the third grade, he became increasingly calculating and harsh, mocking a classmate who did not have a father. The classmate cried very sadly. He laughed at someone for not having a father. As a result, later their house was robbed, and his father discovered the thief and chased after him relentlessly, until the thief reached the end of an alley where there was no way to escape.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural flow:

**Translation:**

"It turned out that the thief, realizing he couldn't escape, became desperate and stabbed the child's father with a knife. It was only one stab, but it hit a vital point, and he died. So, the child who had laughed at others for not having fathers eventually lost his own father. This story is about that child, after he grew up, telling his teacher. Of course, the child is sharing this story with us to accumulate merit, giving all of us who are parents a very important lesson: we absolutely must not teach our children to be calculating. Being calculating leads to harshness, and harsh words damage one's virtue, ultimately resulting in the loss of one's own father.

Therefore, we can see that diligence has so many benefits. What about the opposite, laziness? Confucius said, when you learn one thing, you should be able to understand three others. So what happens if you are lazy? You’ll have poor health, a lack of responsibility, no gratitude, no empathy, poor interpersonal relationships, low ability, and little blessing. Do you see these phenomena in today’s children who are not diligent? And there are more than just these six issues. An ancient saying left for us to ponder is, “A hundred ailments all stem from laziness.” Where do all a person’s bad habits come from? They all come from laziness. Looking at it from the opposite perspective, all sorts of bad habits will emerge.

There’s an ancient book called *Discourses of the States* (*Guoyu*), which records many good teachings from different states. Among them, the "Discourses of Lu" contains excellent teachings from the state of Lu. One passage is particularly enlightening: “Labor leads to thought.” The impact of labor on a person's character is that they begin to think, they start to empathize. “Thought leads to good intentions.” However, if one seeks ease and dislikes labor, “Ease leads to excess, excess leads to forgetting good, and forgetting good leads to bad intentions.” From these passages, we can deeply appreciate the wisdom of our ancestors, who had a profound understanding of human nature and were very perceptive about the development of the whole person. If you don't heed the advice of the elders, you’re bound to suffer. These are truths. So, "labor leads to thought, thought leads to good intentions," fostering gratitude towards parents and others' efforts. But if you become indulgent, "ease leads to excess." “Excess” means indulgence, like oversleeping, seeking ease and disliking labor, preferring play, not working, being immersed in desires, and forgetting good. And as the saying goes, “when one is full and warm, one thinks of lust,” and evil thoughts become more and more frequent. Forgetting good, what happens? "Bad intentions arise," just like the saying that a hundred ailments stem from laziness.

The *Record of Rituals – Record of Learning* (*Liji – Xueji*) provides us with a very important teaching regarding education. “Education is..."—what is the core of education? We are all parents, and educating our children is our duty, which we must understand. The *Three Character Classic* has a very important saying: “If you raise but don’t educate, it’s the father's fault; if you teach but not strictly, it’s the teacher’s laziness.” I am also grateful to my teachers for teaching me this principle before I entered the field of education. I became very vigilant, knowing that I cannot fail to fulfill this duty. “Education is to cultivate the good and remedy the flaws.” These are the two most important focuses of education: nurturing the good and fixing flaws. Cultivate a child's diligence and remedy his laziness. This is what we call education. Cultivate his early rising and remedy his late rising. Therefore, the root of education still comes back to the child’s heart. All good virtues must be planted in his heart, and from then on, become his attitude in dealing with people and the world. So, from these passages, we can feel the importance of diligence. Li Shangyin, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, had a famous saying: “Looking at the rise and fall of past nations and families, success comes from diligence and frugality, while failure comes from extravagance.” Looking back at thousands of years of nations and families, their prosperity came from diligence and frugality, and their decline from extravagance. So the key to success or failure lies in diligence.

The next teaching states, "Keep both the inner and outer clean." Sweeping the courtyard is not just for show. We should also clean our own rooms. Furthermore, we must understand that, “cleanliness is the foundation of good health.” If a person doesn't love cleanliness and order, their environment will become very dirty. Gradually, many harmful bacteria and dirt will grow, which will certainly affect their health. Have you noticed that many children today have respiratory problems? In addition to poor lifestyle habits, it's also related to their overall living environment possibly being dirty and messy.

Therefore, cleanliness helps with our health, and it also affects our state of mind. When our environment is clean and organized, our minds are more settled. When the environment is very chaotic, our minds will become scattered. And often, we might mess things up. For example, if things are scattered everywhere, you might suddenly lose an important document, or pick up the wrong one, and possibly ruin everything. That is why the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (*Dizi Gui*) teaches us, “Rooms should be clean; walls should be spotless; desks should be tidy; writing tools should be properly placed.” “Put hats and clothes in their designated spots; don’t throw them around and cause stains.” The tidiness of our external environment greatly helps our inner state, making our minds more and more clear, and increasingly orderly. The learning of the sages' teachings follows the path of discipline leading to concentration, and concentration opening wisdom. These habits of daily life are discipline, they are rules. When everyone loves cleanliness and puts everything in order, the mind will be calm when taking something. With a calm mind, wisdom will open. If these lifestyle habits are not in place, a person’s mind will be very scattered throughout the day. The next line of teaching states:

[“When it gets dark, rest. Lock the doors. Be sure to check everything yourself.”]

“When it gets dark” means that when the sun sets, we should prepare to rest. Resting immediately at night is very important. It’s following the natural way, following the laws of nature. When the sun goes down, we should prepare to rest. When the sun comes up, we should quickly get up to study and work. If we follow the natural way, our bodies will be healthy, which is more powerful than any medicine. Nowadays, people go against nature and then spend a lot of money on supplements and nutrition products, which is putting the cart before the horse. The vicious cycle is too serious these days. Putting the cart before the horse, people don't live a healthy and regular life, and as a result, they have to work hard to earn money and buy medicine. People who understand the principles shouldn’t repeat these mistakes.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine* (*Huangdi Neijing*) mentions some key points in health preservation: “Moderation in diet,” don't overeat. Diet should be moderate. It’s best not to eat too much, and it's best not to eat at night because the stomach and intestines get adequate rest. Nowadays, people eat midnight snacks, which is self-torture. Of course, everyone’s constitution is different, and changing a habit should be done gradually, so that family members can accept it more easily, and so that one’s own body can better adapt.

"Moderation in diet," then, "regular daily life." Daily life should have a routine, going to bed early and waking up early. Also, "do not overwork." Do not let the body be in a state of excessive depletion. Therefore, if a person feels very tired, they shouldn’t continue to work. Continuing to work may cause severe damage to their body. Some people say, “But I won't finish my work!” Does that make sense? When is work ever finished? It will only be finished one day, when we pass away. Otherwise, there will be circumstances and things to do every day. Therefore, people should think long-term. They shouldn’t wear down a body that should last 100 years until it breaks down at age 50. This is unfilial, unwise, and irrational. Furthermore, if a group has an attitude of staying up late and overworking, this group lacks blessings. Why? Because they are mistreating their employees, how can there be blessings? Those in leadership positions, as the *Dizi Gui* teaches, “Treat your maids and servants with dignity. Even with dignity, treat them kindly and generously." Where is kindness shown? It’s shown in cherishing employees like one's own family members. If you are pushing them to their death, how can that be right?

In Taiwan, within a week, newspapers reported the sudden deaths of several elites in their 40s, either from the business world or from other industries. They died without any warning. They were all what? Overworked, and suddenly they passed away. In their 40s. The schools, families, and society nurtured them, and in the end, it all ended like this. This gives the entire society much to reflect on.

Therefore, regarding the Industrial Revolution, everyone should calm down. The Industrial Revolution has greatly advanced material production, but it seems that people's thinking has become factory-like. People have ended up becoming what? Production tools. "Hurry, I want to earn more money. That person is sick, remove him." Not treating people like people, but treating them like objects. This is wrong. Therefore, we often say, "Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you.” When our children go to work for a company, how do you want the boss to treat them? Likewise, if we are the boss, these employees are also someone else’s children. How should we treat them?

During the Southern Song Dynasty, Mr. Yang Wanli’s wife, in the cold winter, had hired some servants. This 70-year-old woman would wake up early every day to cook hot porridge. Her children couldn’t bear it, saying, “Mom, you don't need to get up so early to cook hot porridge." The old woman said, "No, the people working for me are also someone else’s children. They start working at 3 a.m., and work without any hot food to nourish their bodies, which is very harmful. I'll give them some hot porridge to replenish their energy before they start working.” This is the heart of kindness. And even though she had servants, she breastfed each of her children herself. She said, "If I let the servants breastfeed, wouldn't I be taking the milk away from their children? I cannot do such a thing.” As a result, this old woman had four sons, and three of them passed the imperial examinations. This was due to her kindness and benevolence, because "A family that accumulates good will surely have blessings." So, if an entrepreneur or a leader treats their employees like their own family, this company will definitely have future blessings, great blessings.

Therefore, "do not overwork" includes learning to restrain your desires. Couples in the past understood this principle. The *Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine* reminded us of this thousands of years ago. So who is the luckiest? Those who listen to their parents, listen to the elders, and listen to the classics, they are the luckiest.

"When it gets dark, rest, lock the doors. Be sure to check everything yourself.” “When it gets dark, rest” means we understand not to sleep late. From the perspective of the heart, it means to know how to moderate in all things, not to be excessive. From this knowledge of moderation, besides not depleting the body, people should also be economical with money. A person who understands moderation will apply it to all aspects of their life, including their career. They won’t rush to achieve results, nor will they make promises lightly, only to fail to fulfill them later. They will do what is within their ability. This is all very important. “Things that are inappropriate, do not lightly promise. If you promise lightly, you will err in your advances and retreats.” If you agree to help others too quickly, without considering your time and energy, you might not do a good job, or fail to deliver, and you will lose their trust. Therefore, a proper refusal may make others trust you more because you are cautious. If you make promises easily, you’ll end up breaking them. Moreover, a person who knows how to refuse appropriately is someone who knows how to cherish himself, and knows not to worry his parents and family. Many people do not know how to refuse. They attend many social engagements, and come back drunk and vomit everywhere. Who is the most worried? It’s their parents, their wife, and children who see it and are heartbroken. People with a sense of propriety would not do these things.

Some people say, "When you’re in the world, you can't help yourself." Does that make sense? Do you feel that many things, everyone has their own reasons, and it sounds kind of reasonable when explained, but it also sounds strange? If this world forces you to risk your life to earn money, then we should leave this world. I know one boss who, after leaving the world of social engagements, became physically and mentally healthy, and his business improved—Chairman Hu Xiaolin. He no longer attends social gatherings, and he runs his business based on integrity, doing his best to serve others. As a result, people trust him even more. And he understood a very important principle, that if something is meant to be your blessing, it cannot escape you. If it’s not meant to be, you can’t force it. Once he understood the principle of blessing, his heart found peace. If you don't understand the principles, your body and mind will collapse, your family will suffer, and you’ll often resort to using evil schemes to harm your opponents. These thoughts damage your body and mind and also create negative karma. Once you understand the principles, you’ll think of others in every thought, even thinking of your opponents. Your health will improve. He used to have anxiety, but now he’s very healthy. So the saying “when you’re in the world, you can’t help yourself” doesn’t make sense. It’s because he hasn’t studied traditional culture, and he hasn’t understood the principles. Therefore, we should keep classics like *Dizi Gui*, *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, and *Zhu Zi's Family Sayings* in our cars. If someone says "When you're in the world, you can't help yourself,” you give them the book and say, “I'll give you this book, and then you’ll understand how to leave this world.”

The next teaching states, “Locking the doors,” which is to pay attention to household safety. From a practical perspective, this is how we explain it: beware of thieves. From the perspective of the heart, the teaching is, "prevent the heart from straying into wrongdoing." Besides preventing thieves, who are outside, are there thieves in our hearts? They are the thieves of affliction, which steal away our purity and wisdom, and make us live in worry and suffering every day. And we do not even know when the thieves have entered. Our virtues will constantly decline.

Actually, if we think calmly, we will realize that society today is a big vat of dye. If people do not have a high level of vigilance to prevent the heart from straying into wrongdoing, they will only be swept away by the tide. We have learned that many college students today live a very dissolute life. They indulge in pleasure at night and some play computer games all night long. Their parents spend so much money to send them to college, and they skip classes a lot.

A child's indulgence is the result. What is the cause? It’s that their foundation was not firmly laid when they were young. Therefore, if parents lay a firm foundation for their children from a young age, they will not degenerate in society. With deep roots, they can stand firm. From a young age, they should develop the habit of self-reflection. Zengzi said, “I examine myself three times a day,” reflecting on three things. “Have I been loyal when working for others?” When working for others, or serving others, have we been sincere and dedicated to our duty? “Have I been trustworthy with my friends?” In our interactions with friends, have we been honest and trustworthy, not breaking our promises, not being perfunctory, and not being hypocritical? “Have I practiced what I have been taught?” Have we properly reviewed what our parents, teachers, and the classics have taught us? Have we put it into practice? We should reflect on these three things every day.

Specifically, we should get a notebook when we go home and keep a "reflection journal." Every day we should examine our thoughts and actions from the day. I see from your expressions that you are not too keen on this. So let me tell you, it’s not hard to teach children, the hard part is teaching ourselves. When we hear this, we think, "That’s so much trouble." Actually, we should understand that if we don’t do it today, “Learning is like rowing upstream; if you don’t advance, you’ll retreat.” We should start to put these good habits from the past into practice immediately.

Reflecting actually makes our hearts more peaceful. If people do not know where they are wrong every day, their hearts will be more and more uncertain, and more and more unstable. And not only should we reflect every day, but we should train ourselves so that our hearts can detect when we have a wrong thought. But is it easy? It’s not easy. Many things have become habits, and we don’t even notice that we are doing them wrong. Let’s take an example. When you yawn, do you cover your mouth with your hand? Please raise your hands if you do. Put your hands down. Please raise your hand if you don't know if you cover your mouth. You see, this action is impolite, and we aren’t even clear whether we cover it or not. Covering the mouth is very natural, why? If you open your mouth so wide, won’t people get frightened when they see you? Therefore, this action is very natural and is a sign of respect for others. For example, someone might say: “You have a big temper.” No, I haven't lost my temper in a long time. You see, even when saying that, there’s a hint of emotion. You're still not losing your temper? Sometimes after forming habits, we do not even see them ourselves. “Habits cause us to not be aware.” If we cannot perceive, we cannot change, and we cannot improve.

I remember that Sichuan people are very good at eating spicy food. As long as a cook in a restaurant is preparing a dish, chili peppers will go in. A friend went to Sichuan. He was not used to spicy food, so he repeatedly asked the cook not to add any chili peppers. The cook said, "Okay, no chili peppers," but still threw the chili peppers into the dish. He had already gotten used to it. He couldn’t stop that action. What should people do when they can’t perceive their own habits? *Dizi Gui* says, “When praised, fear; when criticized, be happy.” “Those involved are confused, while those watching from the sidelines see clearly.” Our closest people are most likely to see our problems. They are the ones who watch from the sidelines and see clearly. Therefore, if we do not notice it ourselves, as long as we’re humble and willing to learn, the people around us can remind us. This attitude must be cultivated.

I have a colleague who also teaches. Everyone calls him "Teacher." When being called "Teacher" every day, will that make him degenerate? Yes! Why? Teacher, teacher, teacher, slowly he begins to think that he is only there to teach others. When thinking that he should teach others, he forgets to teach himself. So, in preventing our hearts from straying into wrongdoing, we should constantly see if our hearts are deviating or have become attached to something. As soon as we find this, we must correct it, otherwise, we will deviate more and more. So, I told this colleague that we shouldn’t become attached to being called "Teacher". We're only just learning traditional culture at this age and still have many bad habits that we haven't changed. We don't even have the qualifications to be students of the sages, let alone teachers. This is just a chance to share with everyone. We should be very cautious. Then, I told him that we should be like Sudhana, visiting fifty-three teachers. Everyone is a teacher, and we ourselves are students. That way we won’t be arrogant and want to teach others. We should especially listen to the people around us, because they can see us the clearest.

Right when I was saying this, his wife happened to be next to us. His wife said, "That's right, he doesn't listen to my advice.” Right away, this “teacher” said, "What? I do listen!” I had just finished discussing this with him. His wife just complained a little, and he immediately shut his wife up. I told him: *Dizi Gui* says, “When praised, fear; when criticized, be happy.” Your wife just offered some feedback, but you immediately couldn’t accept it and had to explain yourself for a long time. The *Dizi Gui* is the foundation. If someone who is a teacher cannot even follow the *Dizi Gui*, they don’t live up to the title. If you enjoy the title of “teacher” every day but don't follow the teachings, you are diminishing your blessings.

We have all learned *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. “Open good deeds get worldly fame.” Fame is also a form of blessing. If you have the fame but not the substance, your blessings are leaking away. “Those who enjoy great fame in the world but don’t live up to it often encounter calamities.” If you enjoy a high level of fame, but your virtues are lacking or not enough, your blessings are spent, and you will die when your fortune is finished, and you’ll face misfortune. Therefore, when we are called “teacher” every day, and the title is high but our virtues are insufficient, our blessings are being used up. That’s why I cannot gain weight. So, I must be more vigilant. When walking on the street, I must be particularly careful, because there may be unforeseen calamities. One must be careful to the point of preventing our heart from straying into wrongdoing, and our thoughts cannot be wrong. A single thought is the foundation of good or bad fortune.

So how do we reflect? By accepting the reminders and advice from others. Also, when listening to the sutras or reading the classics, each teaching is meant for ourselves, not for others. If we have this kind of attitude, we will benefit from every ten minutes of listening, and we will benefit from each single word. So the extent of our benefit is determined by our attitude. We should think that we are the intended audience, and that these teachings are all speaking to us. They’re meant to be our requirements, not others, and then it will be easy to recognize our problems. *Dizi Gui* says, “When you can change your mistakes, they are gone.” If we don’t admit our mistakes, “If we hide our mistakes, we are doubling our guilt."

Therefore, the teaching here, "Lock the doors. Be sure to check everything yourself," we can see that "sweeping the courtyard," and "locking the doors" means that from a young age we should feel that we have a responsibility to take care of these things at home, and we should share the burdens of our parents and family. "Be sure to check everything yourself" also develops a person's attitude of being very cautious. Caution is important. If we are not cautious, we might not lock the door properly, and a thief might break into our house, causing serious losses. Therefore, caution can very likely prevent us from calamities. The next teaching states:

["With every bowl of porridge, every meal, we should think of where it came from. With every thread of silk and every piece of cloth, we should constantly think about the difficulties in their production."]

Every bowl of porridge, every meal, does not come easily. We are all familiar with a poem: "Hoeing the seedlings under the noonday sun, sweat drips down onto the soil. Who knows the meal in the bowl? Each grain is the result of hard work.” We should also have our children recite the words of gratitude from a young age: Gratitude for the country's cultivation and protection; Gratitude for the parents' kindness in raising us; Gratitude for the teachers' hard work and teaching; Gratitude for the classmates' care and help; Gratitude for the farmers' hard labor; and Gratitude for the public's trust and support.

And it's not just the farmers' hard work. To live a good life, how many industries provide services to us every day? Can we count them? We can’t, right? As soon as we open our eyes, when we turn on the light, do we need the service of others? The power company, and also those who sell the light bulbs."


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Translation:**

Then, I go into the bathroom, flush the toilet – benefiting the water company and the toilet manufacturer. Next, I brush my teeth, look in the mirror – benefiting the mirror company. Squeezing toothpaste… Can everyone figure out how many industries have served me today? This is why the ancients said, “For one’s daily needs, a hundred crafts are ready.” Various trades and professions are serving us, preparing for us, ensuring that we have nothing to worry about in our lives. Therefore, society truly is a cooperative body. We take from society and should give back to society. Everyone should have this attitude of repaying society, whether it’s with our spirit, experience, or even our finances. “*When thinking of where things come from, remember the effort involved*.” We should ponder, should contemplate, that these foods do not come easily.

“*Even half a thread or strand, constantly remember the labor behind its making*.” Even half a thread, half a line, is created through someone's hard work and sweat. “Constantly remember the labor behind its making” means we should always keep in mind that these items are the product of someone’s diligent effort, and therefore we won't waste them. Moreover, we should understand gratitude and cherish blessings. Those who cherish blessings will not waste things; they are very frugal.

Now, let's calmly consider, what help does frugality provide to a person’s character? It provides great help. How much good intention can one virtue inspire in a person? The ancients had profound wisdom and insight into human nature. When a person is frugal, they will have more resources to donate to others, therefore “frugality with the ability to give is benevolence,” his kindness is elevated. A frugal person will not have their desires constantly inflated. When desires are inflated, one will never have enough to spend or enough to eat, and then what will they do? They will resort to illegal means, like corruption. Therefore, “frugality leads to few desires.” A person who is frugal will not covet many things. This is “righteousness,” he will not take things that are unjust. “To take frugality as a family law” is “propriety,” he understands how to manage the household with propriety. Using frugality to educate one’s descendants is “wisdom;” he is wise. Therefore, when a person understands frugality, the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all increase.

However, this frugality cannot be distorted. If frugality becomes extreme stinginess, that is unbenevolent. If frugality leads to greed, that is unrighteous. If frugality leads to stinginess even in providing for parents, that is a lack of propriety, a lack of respect towards parents. This is a distortion of the true meaning of frugality. Frugality with the aim of accumulating a pile of money for children is not wise; it is lacking in wisdom. Therefore, we must consider whether this frugality is increasing benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, or whether it has become distorted and turned into unbenevolence, unrighteousness, lack of propriety, and a lack of wisdom.

Some might say, how is it unwise to save a little more for my children? Isn’t it true that leaving those things will only lead them to fight and compete with each other? If you open the newspaper, you see such things happening every day. We must learn from these lessons and not repeat such foolishness. Therefore, the *Three Character Classic* says, "People leave their children coffers full of gold," most people leave a large amount of material wealth for their children. "I teach my children, only one classic," we should pass down classics and wisdom to our children. This is what rational parents do.

Today, I will share with you up to this sentence from the classic. Thank you all!

**Notes on Translation Choices:**

* **Figurative Language:** I tried to maintain the figurative language and flow of the original Chinese. For example, “互助之體” is translated as “cooperative body” to capture the idea of interconnectedness.
* **Cultural Context:** Some phrases are translated to reflect cultural understanding, such as “惜福” translated as “cherish blessings.”
* **Classical References:** I kept the translation of the *Three Character Classic* quote in its more literal but widely understood form.
* **Formal Tone:** I aimed for a professional and slightly formal tone, reflecting the likely intention of the speaker/author.
* **Clarity:**  The translation prioritizes clarity and avoids overly literal renderings that might sound awkward in English.
* **"When thinking of where things come from, remember the effort involved"**: I chose this translation for the sentence “當思來處不易” to better convey the sentiment. The idea of effort and the fact that things don't come easily are the key ideas here.
* **"Even half a thread or strand, constantly remember the labor behind its making"**: This translation captures both the literal meaning and the broader idea of cherishing material goods since those goods were created from hard work.
* **"Frugality with the ability to give is benevolence"**: This translation gives the reader the true meaning of the original sentence and its intention.

Let me know if you have any other requests or adjustments!


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and clear style:

**Lecture Three: Foresight Leads to Lifelong Happiness; Inner Joy Comes from Not Pursuing External Things**

Esteemed elders and friends, good day! Today marks the third lesson of our study of the *Zhu Zi Family Precepts*. In the previous two sessions, we explored the lines, "Rise at dawn to sweep the courtyard, keeping both inside and outside tidy." It's been two weeks, and I trust that the habit of rising early has taken root for everyone. Establishing this habit serves as a positive example for children and signifies the flourishing of a family. "Retire at dusk, locking the doors, always checking them personally" – these actions can be done with your children, guiding them to contribute to the household, and instilling a careful and responsible attitude. “With each bowl of porridge or plate of rice, consider the difficulty of its acquisition; with each thread of silk or scrap of cloth, remember the painstaking labor it represents.” After learning this line, there should be no leftovers in the house. “Difficulty of its acquisition.” We cannot learn it ourselves or teach it to our children and then waste food. That will lead to cognitive dissonance in children. Truly, they might ask, "Mom, didn't you say we should consider the difficulty of acquiring each bowl of porridge or plate of rice? Why are we throwing it all away?" Would that cause confusion? Yes, it would.

We've also encountered situations where parents teach their children not to lie. Then, the mother might receive a phone call at home, and with the father reading a newspaper nearby, she'll say to the caller, "My husband isn't here." The child then looks at the mother, then at the father, thinking, “Why did mom say that dad isn’t here?” Therefore, we should always be a good and correct example for our children; that is true love. Because the good example set by parents will profoundly shape their children. Think for a moment, when did you learn filial piety? When did you learn frugality? You don’t know. How did you learn it? Did you think "I was born this way"? No, you learned it unconsciously. So learning must be put into practice. Immediately transform the verses into the family’s way of life, ensuring that these maxims are visible and demonstrated daily. Let’s continue with the next verse:

**“Prepare for rain before it comes, do not dig a well when already thirsty.”**

This verse means that “*Yi*,” or “should,” indicates that we should repair the roof and windows before it rains. “*Choumou*” means to secure (the windows). So that the house will not be damaged by wind and heavy rain. “*Wu lin ke er jue jing*”, or, "Do not dig a well when already thirsty" means, don’t start digging a well when you are already thirsty, because by then it'll be too late. The central point here is, "Advance preparation leads to success; lack of preparation leads to failure." In everything, we should be fully prepared to ensure success. If decisions are rushed, and actions are taken hastily, it's easy for things to go wrong. For instance, when building a house, a plan must be carefully designed, and the foundation must be laid. Only then can a building that lasts a century be built. If these steps aren't followed and there is no foundation but the building is hastily put up just to be able to live in it, then, a typhoon will likely cause it to collapse.

In fact, this phrase reminds us that we should be far-sighted and not just look at what is immediately before us. This is a very important principle. For instance, in educating children, do we focus on their immediate exam scores, or on the key to their lifelong happiness? Is it more important to instill attitudes of being and doing that will lead to happiness, or is it more important to force them to do well on this immediate test? I guess I made it too complex. Basically, is the immediate test score more important or the development of healthy character for a child's lifetime? We are all good at answering the ideal answer. But first, are we daily working towards nurturing our children’s healthy character? Moreover, are we clear about what attitudes children should develop in order to have a happy life, and for their careers and family to thrive? If we haven’t thought about these questions, then we have not prepared for a rainy day.

Dear parents, as your children progress to high school and college, can you be certain they won't become addicted to video games? Can you be sure your college-aged children won't engage in casual relationships? Can you be sure they won't gamble after graduation? Can you be sure they won’t leave their children with you? Be prepared! Can you be sure your children won’t become shut-ins playing video games and refuse to work after graduation? If those things I just mentioned happen in your family, you'll be in big trouble, and life will be difficult. Therefore, one must see the long view. Which successful person succeeded because they got perfect scores on their fourth-grade language and math tests? You see, the things we are concerned about are not the keys to success in life, but time keeps slipping away.

Seeing this verse, and then looking at current social trends, it should provide us with significant insights. People have a tendency to rely on luck, reading newspapers and thinking, “That only happens to other people’s kids, not mine.” "Those are problems for other people’s students, not mine.” *The Three Character Classic* states, "To nurture without teaching is the father’s fault; to teach without being strict is the teacher's laziness." There was a nineteen-year-old boy from a wealthy family who often squandered his money. One day, he suddenly told his parents, “I want to have dinner with you tonight.” The couple was overjoyed, thinking, "Our son is finally willing to talk with us!" They prepared a lavish dinner and waited for their son. When he returned, he brought a girl with him and handed his father a paper. “Dad, she’s pregnant, I’m going to get married, please prepare these things for me.” Upon taking the paper, the father saw a list of properties and cars.

Friends, if you were the father, how would you react to this? Try to get into the story a bit. "Heavens above!" At this point, don’t call out to the heavens, instead, recall the phrase, "Prepare for rain before it comes". "Had we known it would come to this, we would have acted earlier". Why didn't they teach their child properly when he was young, especially considering that our ancestors have always given us wisdom on how to educate? When does that start? From prenatal education. We have heard many examples of mothers reciting scriptures while pregnant, refraining from looking at inappropriate images, and not listening to harmful sounds. “The eyes do not look upon evil sights, the ears do not listen to debauched sounds, and the mouth does not utter arrogant words.” Mothers spoke gently, never with harshness or criticism. This way the child absorbed the mother's positive energy while in the womb. Therefore they have a very good constitution at birth, and don’t cry much. Many say, “Why are children always so noisy after birth?” That’s their child; other people’s children may not be. Those who truly understand will make preparations ahead of time; the sooner we educate a child, the better. The first step is prenatal education.

There's a great book that discusses prenatal education and maternal education, compiling the teachings of Venerable Yin Guang, the teacher of our teacher Master Li Bingnan. It's titled, *The Foundation for World Peace*. Mothers should read it; after reading it, you can share what you've done correctly and allow others to learn from your mistakes. Testifying from personal experience is very valuable. Therefore, I hope you can all share this book with others. For me, it’s harder to share, as people might say, "It's easy for you to say, have you ever been pregnant?" I wouldn’t have an answer for that. Testifying from personal experience brings limitless merit. If you enlighten a mother, and she begins prenatal education from pregnancy, her child will become a pillar of society, and you will have accumulated tremendous merit. And for those who are not mothers yet, it's also good to read, so you can feel confident you can raise a sage-like child. Venerable Yin Guang clearly explains that you should begin to accumulate virtue, "A family that accumulates goodness is sure to have blessings in abundance," and you will attract virtuous children and descendants.

If prenatal education is done well, it’s said, "One can see a person's future at the age of three; the course of one's life is set at the age of seven.” Do you all understand this? At the age of three you can see their future. Therefore the highest return on investment is during pregnancy and the first three years. If mothers put real effort into spending time with their children during this time, they'll never have to worry about them. However, in today's society, parents seem to neglect this golden period when they should be with their children, and instead, they only pay attention when the children are teenagers, disobedient, or have run into trouble. Where do they then spend time? In video game arcades, or even at the police station. Isn’t it so? It is difficult, when they are arrested it is very troubling.

We are also preparing for the future by studying *Zhu Zi’s Family Precepts.* When we set a good example ourselves, our children naturally learn frugality and responsibility. These are all critical factors for success in their future careers and family life. By doing so, we're truly helping our children for their entire lives. Therefore we should think deeply and not just focus on the present. For example, now, people seek partners based on beauty and wealth, but they are only looking at the superficial. As stated later in *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts*: "When marrying off a daughter, choose a suitable son-in-law and do not demand a hefty dowry; when seeking a wife, look for a virtuous woman and do not worry about a lavish trousseau."

Furthermore, when people are always prepared, it shows that they are not prone to procrastination. Many parents are often angered by their children's procrastination: “What are you doing dragging your feet!” If children develop the habit of procrastination, it can seriously hinder their ability to be successful, and can lead to problems. If an important task is given to them, and they delay it until problems occur, they might be fired or they might not be relied upon. Therefore we must not procrastinate. Of course, children should also avoid rushing too much. Therefore, both extremes are undesirable, and balance is important. *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* says, "In doing things, do not rush; when in a rush, mistakes occur." Those who are hurried lack composure and easily make mistakes. Furthermore, those who are in a hurry are prone to accidents. When they are flustered and try to drive a car, or doing something, impulsiveness can easily lead to trouble.

How do we cultivate a mindset that is neither over-zealous nor sluggish? There is a great saying, and you should first do this yourself to show your children. When I talk about this, I immediately think of my father. He prepared things in advance and was always composed. “Slow tasks should be done quickly; diligence brings success.” If things are not urgent, still do them earlier, “Slow tasks should be done quickly; diligence brings success.” Furthermore if you do it earlier, there is sufficient time to address any small changes that come up, “diligence brings success.” “Urgent tasks should be done slowly; haste causes mistakes.” When things are more urgent, we must remind ourselves, and those involved, to slow down, and not to rush, "Urgent tasks should be done slowly". When the mind is properly aligned, then work can be done correctly; otherwise rushing may only lead to more serious problems, which take even more time and energy to resolve. Therefore, “urgent tasks should be done slowly; haste causes mistakes.” In daily life, a small detail forgotten in haste, can take only 10 seconds to remedy; but because it was forgotten, it may take 10 hours to resolve. Thus, one must have composure to avoid making mistakes in what they are doing. When do you practice this? In the midst of daily activities, remind yourself, and constantly remind your children, to instill good habits.

We often say that there are two things in life that should not be delayed: filial piety and good deeds. It is important to be mindful of one's parents and fulfill their filial duties. Additionally, doing good must not wait; this is also “preparing for a rainy day.” We see that life is full of unexpected events; is there anyone who hasn’t encountered challenges in their lives? I think not. Most people have. Some families face big disasters, which can lead to the loss of life and limb. When such calamities occur, without accumulated merit and virtue, it's hard to overcome them. In life, there are two types of bank accounts: one that stores money and the other, an intangible account for virtue. When real disasters strike, not even billions of dollars will be able to resolve it. However, if one has accumulated good virtue, then these disasters can be averted.

We’ve witnessed how the extremely wealthy are unable to save their loved ones from cancer, despite spending large sums. Conversely, we see how families with limited finances, experiencing the same situation of a family member with cancer, they meet with virtuous people who provide guidance on how to manage emotions and nutrition, which ultimately leads to their recovery. From this, we see that turning misfortune into blessing comes from accumulated merit. This is not just about health; for instance, marrying a wife who brings good fortune to a family for three generations. That’s considered a blessing. What happens when one marries an unsuitable wife? They might be completely ruined and never recover. Parents, are you certain your son will find a good wife? "Prepare for a rainy day." I’ve witnessed this many times, when a simple and unsophisticated young man gets into a dangerous situation because he dated an unsuitable girlfriend. In the nick of time, the young man fortunately breaks up with her. This is often because the ancestors are looking after him. People can’t see it, and they're too arrogant. Without traditional culture, people become very arrogant and ignorant of the truth.

Now, many people who have made a lot of money will, if you ask them why they are so fortunate and rich, will only a few say, “Our ancestors were virtuous?” People who have studied traditional culture would probably answer like that. Before learning traditional culture, if someone said to us, “You are very fortunate,” how many would respond by saying, “My ancestors were virtuous”? It seems unlikely. Yet, this is the truth. Looking back at our lives, we realize how late it is in life before we learn these truths. This is such a shame. Our children should know from a young age that they are blessed by their ancestors’ virtues. This will make them cherish their blessings and not become arrogant, thinking everything is their own accomplishment.

Today, I met an entrepreneur from Jiangsu who is involved in wastewater treatment. Is wastewater treatment easy? He did not complete junior high school. However, he is now among the top wastewater treatment experts in China and travels to Malaysia to give lectures. I looked at him and said: “Six hundred years ago, Zheng He went overseas, bringing many skills, and now, six hundred years later you are following Zheng He's spirit to pass on such an important wastewater treatment technology.” We must understand that water is the source of life; if it is polluted, how can people be healthy? He mentioned that more than 70% of the water is now polluted, and that is very serious. And yet he, who never finished junior high school, said that he suddenly understood how to treat wastewater and he found it simple. I learned later from him, that his grandfather recited *The Diamond Sutra* for 28 years, and his mother did good deeds her entire life. He told me this himself; his ancestors accumulated great merit. This is why he, a junior high dropout, now, according to his friends, his company is going public. Of course going public isn't everything, but what is important is his contribution to the entire society. In 2008 China started placing great importance on wastewater treatment. And he had already started doing this in 1993 and his business is doing very well.

I was moved by what he said. He said he is happiest when he sees polluted water become clear, feeling that this is very beneficial to people’s health, and that he will continue to do this for his entire life. Where does happiness lie? Should happiness not be from collecting our paychecks? Should it not be in the value of serving others in our work?

Actually, we are not really happy. If you're very happy when you work, please raise your hand? Isn’t the purpose of life to serve others? Aren’t the 360 professions all about serving people? Why are we not happy serving others? While we are working, we think, “Only two more weeks until payday, it’s taking too long.” We are only thinking of money; how can we be happy? Then we start comparing: “He makes more than I do, two hundred more.” Comparing ourselves with others is vexing. We have been hurt by money. People’s integrity, and their value in serving others, are all measured by money. Where did our dignity go? Where did our spirit of service and dedication go?

This entrepreneur’s work was, to be honest, very challenging. He said that in 2007, after many years in this field, he was also having a hard time. He went to Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui to pay his respects to Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, because his ancestors were all practitioners of Buddhism. After paying respects to Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, that night he went to bed earlier than his friends. He said that when he fell asleep he dreamed of green mountains and trees, and fish happily swimming and jumping about in clear water, and he woke up laughing. After waking up he told everyone, “It was so beautiful.” They replied: “You’re talking in your sleep.” He said that when he returned from that trip, it was as if Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha was telling him: “Keep going, this is your mission.” Shortly after he returned, China had several serious water pollution incidents, with algae preventing many communities from having potable water for many days. He went to help with the cleanup.

Therefore, the virtues of our ancestors are so important. On the morning of his first traditional culture class, he had a dream at 5 AM of his family's ancestral graves. He said that he saw the graves radiating light. He lives near his family’s ancestral graves. To be frank, doesn’t his son’s work in purifying polluted water help countless people? Isn’t that illuminating the world? And he doesn’t only do so in China, he also goes to Malaysia to bring enlightenment. Furthermore, the relationship between China and Malaysia is very close, with a whole industrial park in Kuantan, Malaysia set aside for Chinese businesses to build factories, and vice versa, with an industrial park in Guangxi, China for Malaysian Chinese businesses. Seeing his ancestral graves radiating light, two phoenixes flew in and landed on the dam. After waking up, he went to study traditional culture. After studying, he started with himself, and used his land and money to start a traditional culture center in his hometown. Now he hosts lectures every two months, with about a hundred students in each, all provided for by him. He has benefited and wants to share it with others. Therefore, because his ancestors were virtuous, his son married a woman who had studied traditional culture well. Therefore, doing good, “a family that accumulates goodness is sure to have blessings in abundance.”

I’ve seen many examples of this. A friend's son was not able to find a girlfriend, but after his parents fully committed to promoting traditional culture, the potential brides disappeared, then came a very good wife, I felt she was irreplaceable. She was not highly educated, therefore not arrogant. Of course, there are those who are highly educated and not arrogant; but they are harder to find. If I don’t add this line, I might be surrounded by people outside after the lecture, wanting to talk with me. “Prepare for rain before it comes.” I need to think ahead before going outside.

In these times, if people don’t have a high level of self-reflection, they become tainted by arrogance without even knowing it. People who are beautiful become arrogant. People with long black hair become arrogant; double eyelids become arrogant; tall people become arrogant. These outward appearances all easily breed arrogance. People with higher education become arrogant. People who make more money become arrogant. People who are in high positions become arrogant. People come into the world pure and innocent, why let themselves get so tainted?

Confucius also offered a very important reminder. He used an analogy to the extreme, saying that if a person had the talent and capability of the Duke of Zhou, (*Duke of Zhou was the sage that Confucius admired most, making this the best possible analogy*), “If they are arrogant and stingy, the rest is not worth noting.” If they are arrogant and stingy about sharing their wealth or experience, then their lives will not have a big impact. Think about it, if someone is arrogant and stingy and doesn’t share with others, will they be well-received in a group? They won't. They might not get along with others and cause stress. Arrogant people often make others lose face and feel ashamed with their words.


Okay, here is a professional-quality translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow, keeping in mind the original tone and intent.

**Translation:**

Therefore, his arrogant attitude is diminishing his own blessings every day, and he doesn't even realize it. Mr. Zeng Guofan said that what makes a person disliked is precisely the word "arrogance," being proud.

Just now, we talked about that friend, "A family that accumulates goodness will surely have overflowing blessings." I see that the daughter-in-law they found is very personable, always smiling, and has a particularly good temper. In this day and age, finding a girl with a good temper is rare unless there is ancestral virtue. It's really not easy nowadays, and someone who is also willing to work hard without complaint. Hence, the saying, "The peach tree is young and lovely, its leaves are luxuriant. When this maiden goes to her new home, she will bring harmony to her family." A good girl entering a household will cause the family to prosper. Therefore, "It is wise to repair your house before the rain comes," we should quickly accumulate good deeds in secret, otherwise, even if your family is very wealthy, if your son marries a bad woman, you'll be in trouble.

"Do not dig a well only when you are thirsty." When doing things, one must be stable and considerate, thinking carefully and planning for the long term. Do not just do things at the last minute. This will only cause people to trust us less and less. Today, if you are a boss, what kind of person would you want as an important manager? That’s the standard. If a person thinks, "With every grain of rice and every drop of water, one must remember where they came from," then they won't waste public funds. If they can prepare for a rainy day, then they are a far-sighted and talented general. If you entrust things to them, you can rest assured. But, if they are last-minute people, then you are in trouble. The scripture continues:

[One’s personal consumption must be frugal. When hosting guests, do not linger.]

One’s own personal life and consumption should be frugal and economical. Actually, when people think calmly, eating three meals a day, or even two, is healthier. Because eating less or not eating in the evening allows the entire digestive system to fully rest, and its absorption will be better. On the contrary, eating too much, and even having late-night snacks, puts a very large burden on the digestive system. It will protest, and eventually go on strike, which will then cause problems with the digestive system. There is an old saying that goes, when people go to too many social events, "One meal after another, they end up with a drooping stomach.”  I feel that if people today do not abide by these teachings, life will be very hard and very tiring.

Nowadays, officials are very tired, and people in business are also very tired. I have met some officials who, in just one evening, have to go to five or six different places, or even more. How can their digestive system be okay? After going to so many places, what time do they get home? One or two in the morning. Looking at how these officials live, it is actually a very big loss for the country. This kind of lifestyle reduces their lifespan by at least ten years. Is it easy to cultivate an official? It is not. Therefore, President Xi Jinping is extraordinary. He takes the lead in not being extravagant, not being wasteful, and sets an example of integrity. Civil servants should not waste money on food and drink. Not only does this save the entire country countless sums of money, but by doing this, these civil servants and business people will not be diminishing their lifespans. Therefore, when a leader does the right thing, the impact on the entire country and society is immense.

When we ourselves are frugal in our consumption, it is healthy for ourselves. Those social gatherings and drinking are reduced, so naturally, our mind and body will be relaxed, and our burden will be less. Moreover, we will be setting a good example of frugality for the next generation, which has countless benefits. We have talked before about how “frugality” greatly enhances our morality. “Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom.” If we are frugal and save money to help people who are starving, our compassionate heart will grow, and we will be cultivating virtue. If we are frugal, we will not be greedy, we will not take advantage of others, and even more so, we will not embezzle state funds. This is righteousness, not taking what is unrighteous. This is benevolence and righteousness. Frugality will prevent us from wasting food, which shows respect. Frugality, practiced as a family rule, also shows respect. Frugality, and using it to educate our children, shows wisdom. There are so many, many benefits to frugality.

Everyone can see, just on the first page, almost half is about diligence and frugality. It's clear that a family's prosperity or decline depends on diligence and frugality. Therefore, "Diligence and frugality are the foundation of managing a household." Furthermore, when a person is frugal, it’s also a way of preparing for a rainy day. If you use everything up today, you will have to ask for help tomorrow. If you are frugal today, and have the habit of saving, you can face some situations in your family calmly because you have savings. If friends or relatives have a sudden emergency, you can help them out. These are all ways to prepare for a rainy day.

Next, "When hosting guests, do not linger." “Hosting guests” means entertaining guests or attending banquets. Do not linger so long that you don't want to leave, don't eat until the middle of the night, damage your health, get drunk, and then throw up all over the house when you get home. This is all very bad, and it shows a lack of self-control. So people must understand boundaries and understand moderation. When we think calmly, gathering with friends is a very joyful thing, so how can it end up with everyone harming their bodies? Is this how we treat guests? Some people say that old friends need to drink a toast to have fun, right? But the ancient wine cups were very small, and like the even older ones, there were two thin metal rods on top. What does this mean? After you take a drink, the two rods will almost hit your eyes. The meaning is: “Take small sips, or you'll poke your eyes out.” That is the immediate warning. What is the long-term warning about preparing for a rainy day? If you keep drinking and drinking, you will go blind. Drinking damages the liver, and the liver opens into the eyes. If you drink too much, your eyes will be damaged in the end. The ancients were so compassionate that they designed a wine cup like this to remind everyone to pay attention to boundaries. But nowadays, wine cups are no longer designed like this. People now, not only will they drink beyond moderation, they might not even use a cup and just gulp straight from the bottle to show off their “heroism”. What kind of heroism is that? That is indulgence, that is unfilial piety. Wasting the body that our parents have given us is not appropriate. Therefore, toasting with friends can add to the fun, but we must also cherish each other’s health. We cannot waste it like that. Two or three glasses are enough, knowing when to stop. And not only should we care about their health, but also their wives, children, and parents at home. If they come home drunk after drinking, how much worry will their parents have to endure?

Therefore, people today are very pitiful. They seem to be very righteous, but they don’t know how to care for their friends. "A gentleman's friendship is as light as water." We should be rational and help each other achieve, not indulge each other’s desires. We should extend our care, and also be considerate of their families. Many people gamble until the middle of the night, and their wives cannot sleep at home. This is damaging one's invisible merits.

In the future, after you drink a toast with friends for fun, you can put on a "Sacred Teachings Change Destiny" DVD. If the place where you are eating has a TV, show it to them. Choose the segment that is particularly relevant to where they are in their lives. If they watch it, they will be inspired and change their destiny. I solemnly recommend Master Hu Xiaolin's DVDs. Before he encountered traditional culture, he used to get drunk every night, and he was even anxious and thought about committing suicide. Later, he encountered a teacher who taught him the book *Liaofan’s Four Lessons*, and his entire destiny changed. He finally understood, “What is destined to be yours, will be yours.” If a blessing or wealth is meant for you, it won’t escape you. There is definitely not a sentence in the classics that says, “If you drink a lot, you will eventually have it.” So, he was at peace in his heart. His career and his wealth did not come from drinking too much.

Frankly speaking, the more you drink, the less you will have. First, you will harm your body. You make money, but then you die in your thirties or forties, and all the money is left for the next man. "It is wise to prepare your house before the rain comes," isn’t it? How can drinking lead to a successful career? People lack the ability to think things through calmly. First, if your body is ruined, how can your career get better and better? Furthermore, during the process of drinking, everyone’s body is harmed, and families become uneasy. How can this bring blessings? You are harming your invisible merits while trying to create a career, so how can you have good fortune? Therefore, "A petty person does petty things to their detriment, a gentleman enjoys being a gentleman."

When Master Hu Xiaolin changed his ways, he was happy to be a gentleman. His body is so healthy, he studies the classics deeply every day, is filled with joy, and often gives lectures. Entrepreneurs and the general public benefit greatly. If a person changes their ideas, their entire life will be completely different. He originally was thinking about committing suicide, but now he is studying, "To learn something and practice it regularly, isn’t that a delight?" and is also helping so many people.

So where is the wisdom of life? It is in choosing the right way of thinking. If our way of thinking is correct, our lives will be transformed. Because our thoughts determine our actions, our actions determine our habits, our habits determine our character, and our character determines our destiny. If you truly want to change your destiny, you must first change your way of thinking. To transform to the correct way of thinking, you must read the classics more. *Zhu Zi’s Family Proverbs* and *Liaofan’s Four Lessons* should be read more. We studied *Liaofan’s Four Lessons* together last year. We cannot just put it down from now on. At the very least, we should read it once a week. That book is very insightful. We must study more, and put it into practice. It is very helpful to families. Therefore, CEO Hu no longer goes to those indulgent social events. On the contrary, he has transformed himself, and now people join him. When eating together, it is all light, environmentally friendly and healthy food. Everyone listens to him talk about how to better transform our destiny.

There is an idiom that reminds us that constant socializing and lingering at banquets can cause great harm to one's life. It's called "banqueting in comfort is like drinking poison." “Comfort” means being comfortable and indulging in eating and drinking every day until the middle of the night, and then sleeping until noon the next day. In this kind of life, a person will become completely decadent and lazy. It’s like what? Poison. It’s like taking slow poison, and gradually becoming decadent and dispirited. There are many people like this. If you observe carefully, at midnight, in the pubs and restaurants, who are all eating and drinking? Many of them are young people. If they were working diligently, how could they do this? They are all indulging in “comfort.” “Zhen” is a kind of poisonous bird. If its wings are soaked in water, and someone drinks it, they will die. Therefore, it refers to poison. And this poison acts without people realizing it. Therefore, a life of indulgence and laziness is very destructive to a person.

Last time, we mentioned the saying, "All kinds of bad habits come from laziness." We talked about how diligence can give rise to many good intentions and strengths, while the opposite of diligence is laziness, which causes many bad habits. If a person is lazy, they will not exercise or labor, and their blood circulation will not be good. A lazy person takes other people's services for granted, and does not proactively help others, so their relationships will be bad. Lazy people enjoy ignorant blessings, which are foolish. After they finish enjoying their foolish blessings, their lives will be in trouble. The next sentences are all related to frugality:

[Utensils should be simple and clean. A clay pot is better than gold and jade. Food and drink should be simple but fine. Vegetables from one's garden are better than delicacies. Do not build lavish houses. Do not seek rich fields.]

The utensils we use every day should be simple and plain. “Simple” means the material is good, but it is not any kind of name brand. It is still very useful. And we often keep it clean. "Utensils should be simple and clean. A clay pot is better than gold and jade," means that containers made of clay, made with care, are also very sturdy and durable, and not necessarily inferior to gold and jade.

Frankly speaking, people in this era, they inflict more suffering upon themselves. For example, now when I see, “A clay pot is better than gold and jade,” if the utensils in one’s home are made of gold, I ask you, can you sleep well at night? First of all, you will have to add several locks. Isn't this just inflicting trouble upon yourself? What are utensils for? They are for using, not for showing off. Does showing off make you happy? When people come to your home, immediately, “This is what I bought in Paris,” you hold it high for others to see. Actually, when people compare, what will happen? They will be enraged. When others surpass them, they will be unable to sleep at night and will suffer. And this kind of comparison will only make the pressure on oneself and one's family greater and greater.

Actually, in this era of material abundance, it is not difficult to live a life without having to worry about food and clothing. But strangely, people today feel like they don’t have enough money. Even if both the husband and wife are earning, it’s still not enough. They have fallen into a misunderstanding, the misunderstanding of comparison. We must understand these principles, so that we can walk clearly in society. Otherwise, we will follow the crowd blindly. What should be the standard for what we use, what we eat, and where we live?

Next, the scripture says, "Food and drink should be simple but fine." Our three meals a day can be frugal, and simple. “Fine” means preparing food carefully. I remember when my mother cooked, she used very little oil. The dishes she cooked had the original flavor of the food, it was delicious, easy to digest, and didn’t cost much money. So this careful preparation, how to cook food so that it is nutritious, is very important. Now, there are all kinds of seasonings, and the cooking procedures are very complicated, and the food may have deteriorated. In reality, to eat healthy, you should be more relaxed and simple. People today are actually giving themselves a lot of burdens and troubles.

And when food is simple and easy to digest. People now eat too complexly. Sometimes we see that in restaurants people eat plates and plates of meat, different meats. One type of meat is not easy to digest, let alone several plates, along with seafood and all kinds of things. Therefore, many illnesses nowadays are called “civilization diseases.” Who gave it that name? It's such a nice name, civilization disease. What's so civilized about it? How can you be civilized if you don't know how to eat? Our ancestors taught us, "Calamity comes from the mouth, illness enters through the mouth," which all comes from eating the wrong things. Many diseases now come from overeating nutritious foods, which put a serious burden on the body, eventually leading to illness. Many people have civilization diseases, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer. Doctors tell them to eat less meat, it’s best not to eat any at all. Eating those things is actually harmful to the body, including that there are now many hormones and antibiotics in meat.

Girls who eat a lot of this kind of meat from a young age start menstruating very early. The earlier menstruation starts, the shorter the lifespan, and the higher the chance of getting cancer later in life. Therefore, we see that many girls now mature too early, which is not a good thing. It’s all because human desire is too great, and in order to produce more meat, we violate the natural way of raising animals. Those animals are all force-grown, forced-grown with hormones and antibiotics. Therefore, how are humans smart? "What you send out will come back to you.” How we treat animals, these hormones will eventually return to whose bodies? Human bodies. Therefore, after desires are inflated, many disasters occur. It's hard for people today to eat only healthy things.

The next sentence teaches us how to eat healthily: "Vegetables from one's garden are better than delicacies." If you grow your own vegetables, vegetables and grains grown in your own garden are safer. You can grow sweet potatoes, which are easy to grow, delicious, and fill you up. More and more people are growing their own vegetables now. There is nothing difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. Growing your own vegetables can also save a lot of money on food.

Actually, if a woman focuses on educating the next generation and managing the entire household, she can save the family a lot of money. Let’s do the math. Everyone think calmly. The ancients said, “Men manage external affairs, women manage internal affairs.” This was a deep and far-reaching consideration. What I'm about to ask, everyone please think this over carefully. If a woman’s child lacks virtue, is the chairman of a company going to be happy? Among ten female chairpersons, how many can educate their children well? So what do they earn all that money for? In the quiet of the night, they end up crying, “How did my own flesh and blood become like this?” A woman, by nature, loves her children very much. If her children are not educated well, it is her lifelong regret. But if a woman leaves the household, how can the children be educated well? When children have problems now, parents don't know what the problem is, because they are not there to accompany them.

Many of the mothers here are professional homemakers. I ask you, when your child first told a lie, did you know it? If you didn’t, then you are in trouble. Mother and child are connected at the heart. And the first time a child lies, it will show on their face. If you are by their side, you can correct them immediately. I know many friends whose first lie or theft was caught by their parents and they were beaten severely. From then on, they never dared have those thoughts again, which benefited them for their entire lives. But if children do wrong, and parents are not by their side, they will slowly form habits, and eventually, when they lie, they will not even blink an eye, and you will no longer be able to tell. When can you still correct a child like that? Therefore, whether or not a child has a healthy personality is closely related to whether the mother stays at home. Because by the age of three, a child has been formed for life. Before the age of three, they are very attached to their mothers, so a mother’s virtues and character traits have a very great influence on them.

Let us weigh the two sides. On one side is making money, and on the other is the mother being there. First, a child has a healthy personality. How much money can you use to buy that? Let me tell you, having a mother stay at home is something that money can’t buy. Second, if a mother accompanies her children in their studies, they will form a habit of learning. How much money can you use to buy that? You can’t buy that, can you? When a mother cares for her children at home, she cooks nutritious meals and healthy food, which make the children's immunity and physical condition very good. Compared to children eating out for every meal, their entire lives' health, how much money can you use to buy that?

Please note that if you do not accompany your children and cultivate good study habits, how much tutoring fee will you have to spend? And the tutoring fees, I don't know which year of the Gregorian calendar it will be until you finish. Because they are reliant on tutoring, and have not truly formed a good habit of self-study and learning proactively. They are forced, forced with money. At the end, there will come a day when they won't study anymore. Many students play all the time after going to college and their parents cannot control them. Therefore, what money can solve is very superficial.

So I ask you, when a mother stays at home and cooks for her husband and children, how much do they save on medical expenses? How much do they save on meals? When you are always eating out, you spend money and also eat unhealthy food. Furthermore, when a husband eats out all the time, will he meet someone who he is attracted to, which he cannot control? That is another thing that money cannot buy back. It's very troublesome, isn't it? When a wife makes a husband happy to eat, the family ethics and family atmosphere are so warm, who would want to be out there? They want to hurry home.

From my childhood, I would always want to go home as soon as school was over. It was like that even when I was in university. Home was warm and cozy. After school, there was always red bean soup cooked by my mom. (Just thinking about it, I get hungry and nostalgic.) After growing up, whenever I see those dishes my mother used to cook, I immediately think of my childhood. Such children are very confident, because they have received their parents' full love since they were little. They won’t be lacking and insecure, and they will not want to control or possess others. People who have a very controlling desire for love, it’s because they didn’t receive enough love when they were little, so they are very insecure. Therefore, if we encounter colleagues or friends who are very clingy, do not get angry with them, they also lacked love when they were little. We must shine on them like the sun. I think I will stop the calculation here. That's enough for now. We should carefully experience it every day, and we will understand the wisdom of the ancients, that they understand human nature and the principles of everything, and they saw very far ahead.

Here, it is mentioned that “Vegetables from one's garden are better than delicacies.” Vegetables from one's own garden, if they are prepared well, can be comparable to delicacies from land and sea. “Delicacies” means rare foods. Actually, rare foods, are rare because of their scarcity. Meat in particular, are all those that come from endangered wildlife. Actually, those animals have very high spiritual intelligence and they will resent. Therefore, we observe that many people who eat endangered animals, have issues with their health. People are actually not calm enough to observe. By harming animals and killing them, how can that resentment be resolved? If what we do causes resentment in people and other lives, how can we possibly have good blessings? How can our body not be harmed? Therefore, the sages tell us the truth of the human world: Giving wealth brings wealth; giving wisdom brings intelligence; and giving fearlessness brings health and longevity. Giving fearlessness is about protecting life, not harming it, and not creating fear in life. This is called giving fearlessness.

Before I received this education, when I was little I didn't know better. I liked to play with insects, and ended up harming many lives.

Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a balance of accuracy and natural flow:

**Heaven Keeps Reminding Me, I’m Too Slow to Learn**

Heaven keeps reminding me, but I’m too slow on the uptake. One time, I was climbing a tree to catch beetles. They were always gathered on the tree where sap was flowing, sometimes a dozen or more eating there, and I’d climb up to grab them. I hadn't learned to cherish life; it really impacts your lifespan and blessings. That time, I grabbed one and immediately fell. When I fell, there just happened to be a sharp piece of glass on the ground. I landed right on it, and it cut my artery. I still have the scar; I can show you all. It's about over a centimeter long. That time, it hurt terribly, but I still didn’t get it. Often I would stumble or bump into things, and bleed. There’s always a reason behind these things. When a person often experiences physical problems, or gets hurt from bumping into things, it's often related to not giving fearless giving ( *wú wèi bù shī*).

Another time, I went to the beach. Everyone else was fine, but my foot got cut on the artery underneath, about two centimeters long. I can’t take off my socks to show you all, that wouldn’t be respectful. That time, the impression was very deep; the wound was quite large, two or three centimeters. To make matters worse, the doctor I saw was not compassionate. He even joked and teased me. I am also a little stubborn. He said, "I won't give you anesthesia," and I said, “Fine, don’t.”  He would stitch me up and look at me with each stitch he made.  This wasn't a bad thing, my ability to endure pain improved a lot that time.

Later, in high school, I broke my left arm. There were a lot of calamities in my life growing up. After studying the teachings of sages, these kinds of things rarely happen anymore. It's really different. Before, my mind didn’t change, so my fate was very bad. But when it changes, things are different. In high school, I broke my arm because I fell into a ditch full of ants. And again, it was this arm. I don’t know what this arm did in the past, why is it always this one? So, the saying is true: "Those who don't listen to elders will suffer for it." Fortunately, now I listen. I have to do more fearless giving to gain health and longevity. So, if someone happens to be buying animals for release, the moment I hear about it, I’ll immediately rejoice and join in. I remember before I participated in releasing turtles and soft-shelled turtles, some of them were so big that they were probably my grandpa's age, or even older. They were so long-lived, we need to show them respect. How could you kill and eat them?

Furthermore, "Do not build extravagant houses, do not seek fine fields." In fact, if a person is frugal, their body and mind will be at peace, and their children will have a good family legacy. If you are not frugal, you are truly inviting trouble for yourself. Then if the children are wasteful, the consequences will be endless. "Do not build extravagant houses" means people shouldn’t be thinking about building or buying fancy houses. What are houses for? They're for living in, for sheltering from wind and rain. That's the house’s main function. They aren't for showing off. Nowadays, many people buy very expensive houses, and then they have to pay off long-term loans. Aren’t they just causing themselves trouble? I once met a business owner; why did he buy a villa? Because he saw other people had them, and he couldn’t stand it, so he went and bought one. After buying it, he barely lived in it twice a year, and then he worked his tail off to pay off the mortgage. Yet, there were two people who lived there every day, the maids he hired. Who was the fortunate one? These values have influenced the entire world, so people must not be confused. They must have wisdom.

Americans are doing just this, and it’s killing them. If they earn a salary of three thousand, they live in a house that corresponds with that. When they earn four thousand, they want to move to a place that costs four thousand and take on a bigger loan. When they make five thousand, they move again. They spend their whole lives in debt. If they made five thousand and stayed living in the three thousand place, wouldn't their whole life be more relaxed and comfortable?  They are just seeking trouble for themselves! As a result, this American value system makes them the country with the worst debt in the world. Many people follow the Americans, including me. I watched too many Hollywood movies and got misled. Now, I’ve wised up. I’m not going to make trouble for myself or for my descendants. The Americans have already made troubles for generations of their descendants.

Okay, that's what I wanted to share with everyone today. Thank you!


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**Lecture 4: What is Worth Pursuing?**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! We are continuing our study of the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims*. The previous passages emphasized diligence and frugality. Before each lesson, we recite the text several times. During recitation, it’s crucial to consider: to what extent have I put these teachings into practice? After all, these are family precepts. In education, the most important aspect is leading by example. As the ancestors said, “When you teach by example, people follow.” When parents and elders do it themselves, children naturally emulate and learn. “When you only teach with words, there is contention.” If you just tell your children what to do but don't do it yourself, the effect is greatly diminished.

Let’s look at, “Rise at dawn.” Getting up early and “sweeping the courtyard” shows attention to cleanliness and keeping the home tidy. Once you actually do it yourself, you realize that a clean and refreshing environment is good for your health. Conversely, a dirty environment breeds bacteria, and the poor air quality will harm your health. “Cleanliness is the foundation of health.” A clean environment directly impacts one’s well-being.

If you don't teach them at home, children will go to university, and I've heard many teachers say that the university dormitories look like garbage dumps, a truly terrible sight. I’ve even seen unfinished meals left for three to five days, rotting away. These university students are masters of tolerance, *number one*, they can live in such environments! They're so lazy, one has to wonder how they were raised at home. It's something we should reflect on.

We've seen other situations too. When students first report to their dorms, some of them haven't even washed their clothes before. We watched them wash clothes, and we were astonished. How do they do it? They dump nearly a third of a large box of laundry detergent, give the clothes a couple of shakes, and then hang them up. Honestly, if they can't even take care of themselves, how can they shoulder responsibilities for others? I think it would be a blessing if they didn't cause trouble.

These basic life skills directly affect their ability to do anything. If they take care of these things themselves, if they are diligent, their minds are also very agile. They think about what they are doing. They develop a sense of priorities. Their abilities are cultivated through these experiences. Even in writing Chinese characters in a nine-grid format, they are practicing how to structure the characters and arrange them correctly. This is like approaching a task—thinking through the steps, doing things appropriately and reasonably. It's all a gradual process that trains a person how to get things done. Last time we talked about:

【*Do not build extravagant houses; do not seek fertile fields.*】

If we think about it calmly, people today often do things based on their likes and dislikes, acting on emotion and impulse. Truly rational people don't act based on preference, but on what is right and what the consequences of their actions will be. They look far ahead, not just saying, "I don't care; I'm just going to do this."

"Do not build extravagant houses." I have an elder who has three children. He and his wife worked very hard to save a lot of money. Later, his health declined. He got a serious illness due to overwork. One day, he was sitting in a car with his three children. He had just purchased three houses. From the car, his only son started talking about which house would be for the eldest sister, which would be for the second sister, and which would be for him. His mother, upon hearing this, asked, "Where will your father and I live then?" He said, "We'll see later."

Doesn't that make you think? Is that a fortunate calculation or a disastrous one? Is it a blessing or a calamity? This elder said something very insightful. He said, "We are probably the last generation to be filial to our parents, but we may be the first generation to be abandoned by our children." He was about fifty-something. Don't take this personally; the situation in Malaysia is a little better. But we must quickly improve. “It is better to prepare for the rain than to dig a well when thirsty.” If you realize in your sixties or seventies that “I miscalculated; my children won't take care of me," you've miscalculated indeed.

So, if you don't teach your children about filial piety, and how to be a good person, they will develop an attitude that all the material things you give them are "deserved," as if they were entitled to them. What is the situation with young people today? They argue with their parents, saying, "Other parents leave houses, why don't you buy a house for me? My classmate's parents bought him a car, why don't you buy one for me?" They feel they are entitled to these things. Some even get married, have kids, and then bring the babies back to their mothers to raise. When the mother says, "My back is sore, I've hurt it," the kids will say, "My friend has two or three kids, and his mother is taking care of them. You only have one, and you don’t want to?" "Prepare for the rain," and "What a pity, had I known, I wouldn't have done it in the first place." We must act with wisdom and not be led by emotions and impulses.

Truly sensible children understand the principle of righteousness, not just the pursuit of profit. They think that it was not easy for parents to raise them. They think about how to bring happiness to their parents, not to covet a single cent from them. I have a colleague with three siblings. She is the eldest. Her parents had some money and wanted to divide it among them. She said, “Just give it to my younger brother and sister.” Her brother said, "Give it to my two older sisters." Her sister said, "Give it to my brother and eldest sister." The parents were very happy. Her parents told them, “Your mutual love and respect, and not fighting over money, is the greatest peace of mind you have given me. It is more important than having wealth or houses.” So, if a person has integrity, they are at peace their entire lives. They do not have lingering worries because people with integrity are willing to share both good times and bad.

Looking at “Do not build extravagant houses,” society today should really reflect. There was a case in Singapore of two sisters, both doctors. When we hear doctors, we associate them with wealth. A retired female head teacher talked about this. She said that these two sisters’ mother had passed away, and before the burial, the two sisters were already fighting over the only house their mother had left.

When we see this example, we don’t blame the sisters. Rather, we wonder what their life goals are. I believe they are also very pitiful, lost and confused. They are so wealthy, what is the point of that house for them? I can’t understand. As greed grows, our desires become like a bottomless pit. Everything they own, honestly, they cannot take with them into the coffin. No, they can’t take it with them at all. In old films, what is the scene when someone is about to die? They can’t hold onto anything; their hands are empty. What can you take with you? You can’t even take your body! How could you possibly take your material possessions? But if people think about it, “a peaceful death leads to a peaceful reincarnation.” If you cannot let go even when dying, you cannot be peacefully reborn, and your spirit will degrade.

Where does the value of life lie? In the wisdom and spirituality that you can take with you. To spend a whole lifetime chasing after things you can’t take with you, to be greedy, to have so many attachments, to be constantly fighting and creating bad karma — aren’t you making things difficult for yourself? Ultimately, you can’t take any of your worldly possessions with you, but you take along a ton of bad karma, entering an endless cycle of resentment. People don’t understand that this body is a tool used by their spirit. Honestly, if you’re asleep, people could carry your body away and you wouldn’t even know it. When a person is asleep, the spirit is dreaming, and it might be dreaming about being in heaven or somewhere else. So this body is just a tool.

Where does a person’s wisdom and understanding lie? In understanding that the body isn’t “me,” but is a tool “of me,” a tool for my soul. It's like clothing; clothing isn’t me; it’s a material tool I use. If people don’t understand this, they will think their body is “me” and then they do everything for their body. They eat pangolins, bear paws, and shark fin soup. They are eating so many wild animals that they are nearly extinct, and they spend huge amounts of money in extravagance and waste. These animals are highly spiritual. Elders, friends, if someone cut you with a knife, would you feel pain? Would you think, “I'll remember that?” If we all do, wouldn't other animals fear death as well? Why wouldn’t they feel pain? People do it all for the sake of their tongues. Honestly, when you swallow something, do you even know if it was abalone or shark fin? Just for this brief moment of enjoyment, they spend so much money, and with so many people starving, and so many lives harmed and killed, why? Just for the sake of this body, they are hurting so many lives. It's all backwards! Good health is a result. What is the cause? It is protecting life and achieving longevity. “The benevolent live long.”  How could killing living things lead to longevity? There is no logic in this, and we must understand the principles of the universe.

The generosity of giving money leads to wealth. During the early Republic of China, Mr. Nie Yuntai, the grandson of Zeng Guofan, grew up in Shanghai. He spent decades observing the process of how extremely wealthy people fell from grace. He documented all of this in his book. He said that people hold onto their wealth, never giving to anyone. They would watch people die of starvation right in front of them. He said, "My way of getting rich is to never let any money that gets into my pocket go out." He was so proud of that. In the early Republic of China, he owned 30 million silver dollars. One silver dollar was worth quite a lot. People are sometimes pathetic, pathetic to the point that they don’t even realize what they have done wrong before they die. As a result, he had ten sons and grandsons, and within just a few decades, all ten sons and grandsons lost their family fortune. Some even became beggars. The ancients said, "Accumulating wealth destroys the Way." To watch a person starve to death before your eyes, while having so much wealth yourself, destroys your conscience and your kindness. Thus, giving money is how you gain wealth.

The generosity of giving the Dharma leads to wisdom and intelligence. If people have good wisdom, experience, and knowledge, they should share it with others. The more they share, the more intelligent they become. My teacher has been lecturing on the classics for 55 years. Giving the Dharma leads to wisdom and intelligence, and you can see that in my teacher. At 87 years old, his eyes are bright, and he is eloquent. He recently spent a month in Malaysia and was on national TV twice. Did everyone see him? The host asked him any question, and he answered immediately with the teachings, without any need to think. Isn't that the best example?

Moreover, my teacher always provides medicine to people, eats vegetarian food long-term, and protects life, so he is healthy and lives a long life. At 87 years old, he has a lot of energy.  Whenever we sit with him in the evening, he takes every chance to teach us.  Sometimes, it’s quite late, and we are all exhausted, but he is still full of energy. Then, I say to him, "Teacher, shouldn't we rest now?" But it wasn’t that he needed to rest. We were the ones who needed to rest. He is more than forty years older than me, of my grandfather's generation, and I still have less energy than he does.

He has thoroughly embodied the generosity of giving money, the Dharma, and fearlessness. He has achieved such freedom in giving money that he usually has none. Isn't it troublesome to keep track of money and carry it with you? Sometimes, when you have too much, you get nervous, thinking, "If I withdraw all this money, will people see me?" He normally doesn’t have a single penny. Wherever he goes, people are grateful for his teachings, and they naturally take care of him. For example, for the Lu Jiang Culture and Education Center, it took quite a bit of money, I think several million Malaysian Ringgit. When they first wanted to build, he didn’t have a single penny. A fellow Malaysian felt that the education concept was great and took charge of the entire construction. He is the layman, Lai. When a need arises, someone immediately appears to resolve it, even though he doesn’t normally have a penny. Today people are thinking about which stocks to buy, or which bank to deposit their money, and they are constantly trying to remember all the passwords. It is exhausting. People are living hard lives these days.

Let me tell you where the best place to store your money is: accumulate merit and virtue. That interest is incredible! The more you give, the more you save, and the more there will be. When you need money, it will come right away. I remember once my teacher mentioned that a particular sutra should be printed, and they needed 300,000 Taiwan dollars. Immediately after he said that, an elder came in and said, "Teacher, my children are very filial and said they wanted to celebrate my birthday. I said, 'Forget about it. You can all use the money to print sutras so the world can read them and gain wisdom.'" His children were happy to follow his wishes and gave him a red envelope with a check for 300,000 dollars.  He brought the check in, saying, "Teacher, I would like to offer this to you so you can print sutras." They looked, and it was exactly 300,000 dollars.  Just as the need arose, 300,000 came. It's really free and easy.  We must understand these truths. People can't live ignorantly, allowing their spirit to degrade. We should strive for the wisdom and merit we can take with us. We shouldn't seek or cling to the worldly things that we cannot take. Enough is enough.

There was a very greedy person who couldn't die in peace while lying in bed because he kept saying, "Ugh... ugh... that candle..." meaning that there were too many candles lit, and it was wasting money. Sometimes, you see people's attachments most clearly in their old age. So, to enjoy old age is to be able to let go of many things. If in old age, you are still comparing yourself with others over money, if you are still comparing your children's income to others, then, even if you have a lot of wealth, you will not find peace. You will not be able to enjoy any happiness. When you are busy comparing with others, you will still be angry. Why bother? So, contentment brings happiness, and being kind is the greatest joy. We see many elderly people doing volunteer work in their later years, helping others, and fearlessly giving. They stay healthy, live long lives, and become more robust.

A friend of mine pointed out something to me, and it made me observe things more carefully. He received an English education from a young age, and all of his friends spoke English. Later, he studied traditional culture. The first time he heard my teacher give a lecture, someone told him, "This old man has dedicated his life to all sentient beings, to the nation, to the propagation of the righteous Dharma." He didn't believe it. He said, "I've seen so many people in my life. Someone being truly selfless is impossible." He didn't believe it. But, he sat at the back the first time he listened to my teacher. He was attracted by my teacher's compassionate aura. Slowly, slowly, he moved closer and closer, listening. Later, he really understood that my teacher was not at all concerned with himself, that he was completely dedicated to others, to the transmission of national culture, and even working for world peace. It's strange, he didn't speak Chinese well at all, but now, his Chinese is very good because he listens to my teacher’s lectures every day. His Chinese is gradually improving.

It's also strange that he used to talk about business with the officials he knew, but it's different now. Now, when he meets them, he talks about education. When he meets officials he says, "You must promote ethics and morality, you must promote the sacred teachings, so the people can benefit.” He says that if he tries to speak with them about business in Chinese, he can't, but when he speaks about the teachings of the sages, he speaks with confidence. Perhaps, when he talks about the teachings of sages, the ancestors and sages will protect him, so he becomes even more enthusiastic.

He said that through his observation, most people with an English education retire and their lives revolve around playing golf, afternoon tea, and trying to figure out how to spend their money. However, people with a Chinese education think about where to go volunteer when they retire. He wondered why the values were so different?

Culture has a different impact on people.  Western culture over the last couple of centuries has focused primarily on utilitarianism. When they retire, they don't think about giving back to society.  Is all the money they have earned solely due to their own efforts? Without their employees, without the stability of society, how would they have earned so much money? But when we make money, sometimes, our attitudes towards life will become skewed, without us realizing it. When we are skewed, who will follow?  The next generation. As the saying goes, "Man proposes, God disposes." If we know to repay society, our children will know to be grateful and repay kindness. If we are completely selfish, only thinking of ourselves and feeling that the money is ours to spend as we wish, our children will think the same. So, what we take from society, we should give back to society.

This attitude is a major hidden concern for our society: the extreme gap between the rich and the poor. The rich think the money is all theirs, and they don't value it. They buy extravagant things at the Arc de Triomphe, where they buy one thing that a farmer would have to work for two or three decades to afford. If they squander their money like this and don't help the poor, how long do you think they can stand seeing it? This is why there is rioting and looting of the rich in many places. "It takes more than a day to freeze three feet of ice." This is something we should reflect upon. You cannot overdo things. You must be kind, polite, and modest.

What kind of values are we giving to our children? What is the value of a happy and prosperous family? How is all this chaos created? It all comes from people's hearts and thinking. If you teach correctly, their lives and families will be happy and prosperous. That is why it says, “Educate your children with righteous principles.” There must be a correct method to educate children, you cannot teach them incorrectly.

We talk about people having “foresight and hindsight,” which is wisdom.  What is the “fore” view? Where did my good fortune come from? Earning money is a circumstance, but where did my blessings come from? “A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have abundant blessings.”  What is the “hind” view? What should I do to bring blessings to the next generation, not to bring them misfortune? So, "Do not destroy your descendants with wealth." Leaving behind too much wealth will bring trouble to children.

Let me give you a real example. There is a person in Taiwan who worked hard his entire life at a large company. He was a senior and long-serving employee. Does a senior, long-serving employee at a big company have wisdom? Not necessarily. You have to understand that making money relies on opportunity. If they have this much money in their life, they'll make it even without wisdom. Having money doesn't equal having wisdom, and if you have money without wisdom, disaster will surely follow. Think about it calmly. In the last 20 to 30 years in mainland China, how many people have gotten rich? Many Chinese from overseas have gone to China to make money. But you see, even if they make money, they often have affairs, and their family is broken up.  They made money, but ultimately couldn’t bring it back because they didn’t have the wisdom. “Even if your children are stupid, they must read scriptures!” Without reading scriptures, how can they gain wisdom? You need to see far ahead. You need to see your children's whole lives. As parents and elders, you should even be able to see their future lives. This is wisdom. In a moment, I will give you a true example of a scholar who could see his descendants a thousand years into the future.

This person in the business world left 2 billion Taiwan dollars, which is quite a lot of money. But he built a house for 100 million. “Do not build extravagant houses.” Sadly, he didn’t read the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* first. It’s my fault. I didn’t have a chance to talk with him. If I did, he might have avoided this disaster. I should have analyzed the benefits and drawbacks for him. If people truly understand, why would they do such a thing? A house is for living in. What is the point of spending 100 million? Someone in Taiwan once used what for a toilet? Gold. This person's business quickly failed. Any perceptive person could have seen that he would fail just by seeing the toilet he used.

There are records of this in history. During the Shang Dynasty, Ji Zi knew that King Zhou was going to lose his kingdom just by watching him eat. He was very sharp. Why? Because he saw King Zhou using a pair of ivory chopsticks, and knew it was over. Was using a pair of chopsticks really that serious? If someone uses ivory chopsticks, what kind of cups do they use to drink? What kind of bowls and plates? Probably something made of gold.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, striving for accuracy and natural flow:

**Translation:**

Would he, using a gold plate, serve just two pieces of tofu? What would he serve? Delicacies! If he wants to eat delicacies, would he do so wearing a t-shirt? He would wear fine silk brocade. If he wears silk brocade, would he live in a small wooden hut? Where would he live? A grand mansion. Correct. May I ask if there’s anyone here from the accounting department? How much would all that cost? Where would the money come from? He is the emperor; it comes from extorting the common people. The common people can’t make a living. Finally, they say, “I’ll fight you to the death!” That’s how King Zhou lost his kingdom.

A pair of chopsticks can tell you about the fall of a nation, and a toilet can tell you when his business is about to fail. Today, when you go home, look at your familiar home. Can you tell if it’s heading towards prosperity or decline? If you can, then you haven't wasted your time studying *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Managing the Family*.

I once met a friend. One person was very moved by seeing the cell phone he used. “What era is it already? You’re still using that phone? You’re a friend worth having!” That cell phone might have been from ten years ago. He was still using it, and people were touched, thinking, “This person is truly frugal.” He’s a university professor, so frugal. From childhood, he had memorized the *Classic of Filial Piety* and the *Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra.* You can see that a family's upbringing makes a big difference.

This friend had a huge impact on me. He was five years older and a Ph.D. At that time, as a university student, I would look up to Ph.D.s with admiration. He also had great self-cultivation, often reciting verses for me. But what I gained the most from, and what deeply moved me, was this: Once when I visited him, he was planning to transfer from a private junior college to a national university. He didn’t dare make such an important decision on his own. He went home to report the situation to his father. I happened to arrive just as he was reporting, and when I entered, he said, “Li Xu, I'm sorry, I am just in the middle of reporting to my father. Please have a seat.” I sat there and watched him report to his father, respectfully kneeling and speaking to him.

That kind of filial piety and respect from a university professor left a lifelong impression on me. Therefore, he is fair-skinned, chubby, and has large earlobes—a very fortunate person. What makes him fortunate? He sleeps very well. We are good friends, and when he visited me, we slept in the same bed. Then, he would say, “Li Xu, I want to sleep,” and he’d be asleep within five seconds. He is truly blessed. Many wealthy people need sleeping pills to sleep, they’re not so lucky. Who is the luckiest? Those who eat and sleep well are the luckiest; in fact, it’s those who can let go of things. Another time, I was on the phone with him, and what happened? He fell asleep while on the phone. The next day when I called him, I said, “You fell asleep while I was talking yesterday.” And he said, “Did I? Did I?”

Looking back, I find myself more drawn to spending time with older people. I think it's related to these experiences. I feel that their life experiences and wisdom offer us great insights, and I am grateful to them. When I was in college, my nickname was "Old Xu." The "old" was because I had befriended older people. Sometimes, when I gave them advice, they’d actually agree with it. So, when my college classmates encountered problems, they would always seek my advice.

For example, they’d ask, “What should we do? We’re about to fail our courses!” They’d say, “Oh no, we can’t pass, we’ll get kicked out.” I’d think, “There’s strength in unity.” We’d form a study group. Each person would specialize in one subject and take charge of it, and then they’d teach everyone else. There were many like-minded people who joined, and we actually all passed our courses.

However, one subject was very peculiar. What was peculiar about it? The student in charge of that subject failed, but all the people he taught passed. He was so frustrated he was about to burst. He couldn’t understand how the teacher graded, and neither did I at that time. Because I hadn’t yet studied *Liao Fan's Four Lessons.* If I had, I would have known that if one is destined to fail, he'll fail even if he can teach others. Therefore, in the past, even very knowledgeable people would fail the imperial examinations, while others who seemed less knowledgeable might pass them easily because they were destined to.

If people don’t understand these principles in their life, countless people will be frustrated and bitter, blaming fate and suffering silently. Our ancestors said that understanding principles brings peace of mind. If you don't understand principles, your mind cannot be peaceful. Therefore, if our children don’t first understand these principles, their values will be seriously misled by this big dye vat of society. On this journey of life, we are truly grateful to our parents for instilling our values. We feel that family, kinship, brotherhood, and moral principles are most important in life, and we find that meaningful. Pursuing fame and fortune doesn’t seem very appealing to me. That’s the attitude that was ingrained in us from a young age. “As habits are formed young, they become like nature.”

Earlier I mentioned a businessman who spent a hundred million to build a house, a "glorious mansion." Let me ask everyone, who would pay close attention to this family once this house is built? Thieves. Building that house is like saying, “I’m very rich, feel free to come visit!” Right? It’s not just thieves who will come. His children and grandchildren’s friends will also have their eyes on his assets. Isn't he bringing trouble upon himself?

In ancient times, there was a man named Feng Qiu. His wife wanted to buy a hairpin that cost 700,000 *qian* (ancient coins). It was just a hairpin to put in her hair. At the time, a Prime Minister's daughter also wanted to buy one. I heard this from Dr. Zhong Maosen, who was teaching *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Managing the Family.* We all studied with him, and he was excellent. You can all study these materials online. The Prime Minister was a wise man. He told his daughter that if she bought it, it would be a "jinx," and she would certainly attract trouble. So he didn't buy it for her. The businessman Feng Qiu bought it, and not long after, he was murdered. It was because he was too wealthy; many people had their eyes on him and plotted to kill him.

Therefore, a good wife, as the saying goes, "a virtuous wife brings fewer disasters to her husband." If a wife is virtuous, her husband will avoid disasters because of her virtue. However, if the wife is vain, her husband's misfortunes will come. Many public servants end up on the road to corruption because their wives are vain. Sometimes, it’s the mother who is greedy, sometimes it’s the wife, and ultimately, these civil servants lose their integrity.

He really built a house worth a hundred million. After building that house, he had a stroke. His children and grandchildren got addicted to gambling and spent 2 billion within a year. Is that the end of the story? After spending the 2 billion, will his son and grandson repent and cry? Unless they've been taught moral principles since childhood, it's not easy. But it’s also possible that they might encounter good people like you, who will give them the "Sacred Teachings Change Destiny" DVDs. Then his children might watch and repent. Why? Because their family was so wealthy, they must have done good deeds in past lives. They still have good roots, but they are controlled by their desires in this life. We’ll have to see if that opportunity to reawaken those good roots presents itself. If there is a chance, we must introduce people to sacred teachings, because without the guidance of the classics, people’s wisdom cannot be opened.

As I said earlier, Fan Zhongyan was able to think of his descendants a thousand years into the future. He planted two pine trees in front of his house and wrote, "May their cool shade provide great shelter for thousands of years." He wished that the shade of these two trees could protect his descendants for a thousand years. Indeed, Fan Zhongyan’s descendants are very prosperous and have very good family values.

His children were very filial. They bought a beautiful garden in Suzhou, hoping their father would live there in his old age. When his father heard that the *feng shui* of that land was particularly good, and that if they lived there, their descendants would be very prosperous, what did he do? He used that land to build a school. This man was selfless. That school still exists today, and over the past few hundred years, it has produced hundreds of graduates with the *jinshi* degree, and several dozens of top scholars. You have to understand that all these merits are recorded where? Recorded in Fan Gong’s merits, in his family’s hidden merits. If he had used that land to live there himself, it would have been very different. Therefore, where does blessings come from? From the capacity of your heart. The bigger the capacity, the greater the blessing. Not only did he not build a glorious mansion, he used that good land to nurture talents for the country.

Fan Gong didn’t keep idle money. As soon as he had some, he would help others. When he passed away, “on the day of his death, he had no means of being buried,” meaning that his family had no money. “His children had no means to hold his funeral.” Later, the country and some colleagues helped hold his funeral. Although he didn't leave money for his children, he left behind righteousness. Money Commissioner Fu wrote an article called “Record of the Righteous Fields,” because Fan Gong was about the Way of Righteousness, helping all the clans, helping the poor, and nurturing talents for the country, especially those students who didn’t have the means to continue their studies. He helped them, so they could study with peace of mind and serve the country in the future. “Using his wealth to support the poor and sustain the clan.” This is the righteousness he left behind to his descendants. When Fan Gong passed away, his righteous fields were one thousand *mu*, but by the Qing Dynasty, his descendants had expanded it to four thousand *mu*. His descendants are so blessed because they inherited the value of “righteousness.”

“Do not seek good land.” Don’t just seek fertile land. Don’t just think about leaving good material possessions for your children. In the early Han Dynasty, Liu Bang had many meritorious officials. More than a hundred people were given titles and became wealthy. After a period of time, the historians traced the fortunes of these families. Most of them had declined. Only a few decades had passed, and most had declined. Then they discovered that one family was different: the descendants of Xiao He. Xiao He’s contributions were among the top. He was one of the three heroes of the early Han Dynasty. Xiao He had so many merits, but he asked the emperor to reward him with ordinary land. He didn't want fertile land. Why? Because he knew that if the land was too good, his descendants would rent it out and collect rent, and wouldn’t work hard. Slowly they would become more and more comfortable and eventually the family would decline. However, if the land wasn’t too good, they would have to be diligent but wouldn't starve. He wanted that kind of land. He thought far ahead for his descendants. As the *Three Character Classic* says, “Some parents leave their children coffers full of gold, while I teach my child the scriptures only.” You must enable your children to understand principles. If they have wisdom and righteousness, they will be blessed. It goes on to say:

【“To enjoy gossiping and slandering is, in fact, a medium for lechery and theft.”】

“To enjoy gossiping and slandering” is actually a general term for people who are not upright. These are people who often engage in deceitful actions and have evil thoughts. And after we become adults, we are most influenced by our friends. Confucius said that we should make friends who are beneficial to our moral conduct and not make friends who harm it. When we see people who are not upright, we should know to “respect them but keep a distance.” We respect everyone, but "distance" means that we don't let their negative influences affect us. In the *Yin Zhi Wen of Emperor Wenchang*, there’s a line that says, “Avoid the wicked and eliminate the disasters coming to your brow,” meaning that it is possible to resolve the disasters right before your very eyes. If we think calmly, many people amass wealth and then quickly lose it all because they were led by friends into gambling, drinking, drug use, or sexual indulgence. They are destroyed in an instant. Therefore, educating our children to choose good teachers and good friends is very important. If children from a young age are fond of the teachings of sages and virtuous people, then, "birds of a feather flock together.” They will not want to be with so-called "wine and meat" friends.

Of course, the teachings of our ancient sages and virtuous people are an inner discipline. Inner discipline means knowing to look within your own heart for the root of the problem, instead of pointing fingers outward or shirking responsibility. This is inner discipline. A scripture can express the spirit of inner discipline. It says: “When you don't achieve what you are seeking, look back at your own self.” Today, if people who enjoy gossiping and slandering appear in our lives, why are we attracting these people? It's possible that we also have these tendencies, which is why we can have these “like-minded” relationships with them. If we truly didn't have these desires in our hearts, even if these people were all around us, we wouldn't be affected. Therefore, we must guard against evil and stop it, prevent the desires and wrong attitudes of our own heart. Correct them, and when you adjust, the outer world changes. Then you can surround yourself with the teachings of ancient sages and virtuous people and gradually the people addicted to gambling and pleasure seeking will naturally distance themselves from you. Right? If they come to you and say, “Let’s play *mahjong*!” you can say, “Confucius said, ‘Isn’t it a pleasure to learn and practice it constantly?’” They’d be shocked. They’d lose interest; they wouldn’t be compatible with you. So, to change our destiny, we must work on our own hearts. We can’t blame others.

Many people get cheated out of their money these days. Certainly, there are many cases where people use other people's kind hearts to cheat them out of money. But sometimes, it’s what? Using people’s greed. In these cases, we can’t blame society or the government. We must think calmly, “When you don't achieve what you are seeking, look back at your own self.” When I see these news stories, I actually feel ashamed. These scam groups often have Master’s degrees or Ph.Ds. They have very high education levels. Why is it that after receiving education for 10-20 years, they end up committing crimes? It's because they weren't taught moral principles. Therefore, their families are responsible, their elementary school teachers are responsible, their middle school and university teachers, and all their teachers who have ever taught them are responsible. As the *Three Character Classic* says, “To bring up a child without education is the father’s fault. To teach without strictness is the teacher’s laziness.”

It’s the same when someone is running a business. They hire a manager, and in the end, the manager ruins the company. We get angry. But the key is: who hired him? The boss hired him. So how can we blame anyone else? The source of the problem is still with us for hiring him. If we think about it further, why did we hire him in the first place? It’s because he was talented, and if he started, our profits would come. We didn’t consider if he was virtuous or not. It was shortsighted and focused only on profit. They were only focused on earning money now. They didn't know that Confucius said that if someone is not kind but also very talented, "lacking sincerity but is very capable," then what is he like? "It is like a jackal, a wolf. You should not get close.” Like jackals and leopards. Sooner or later, they will eat you up. You must not be near such people. Confucius said this in his *Confucius’ Family Sayings* more than two thousand five hundred years ago.

What should we look for in the people we hire? “Virtue and talent both.” Have you heard the idiom, “talent and virtue both”? This idiom is very important. “Character and academics both.” Character comes first. Only if you have character can you properly utilize your academic skills. If you prioritize academics over character, these types of problems will arise: highly educated individuals who commit crimes. It’s not just committing crimes, if they are highly educated and they lack morals, then the divorce rate will be so high, their lives are ruined, and even the people who become close to them or become their family members will be in trouble. We cannot nurture people like that. It is better to prioritize character and academic skills both.

“To enjoy gossiping and slandering,” means to say a lot of things that cause others to develop bad and immoral thoughts, which then acts like a catalyst. Therefore, people accumulate blessings through their mouths, but they also can create bad karma through their mouths. The ancients said, “Sickness enters through the mouth,” so we should pay attention to our eating habits. “Disaster comes from the mouth.” Speaking improper language causes others to desire wealth, sex, and other bad ideas. We are responsible for the cause and effect and become an accomplice. When people talk, they shouldn't talk about these things. What should they talk about? *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Managing the Family*, right? If every family understands these principles and raises good children and grandchildren, then society will be stable and the country will have a future. Next:

【“Beautiful maids and alluring concubines are not the blessings of the boudoir.”】

If your maidservants are very beautiful and your concubines are very alluring, this is definitely not a blessing for the family. It's likely a source of disaster. *Boudoir* refers to the husband and wife’s bedroom. I remember one TV series—I forgot the name because I only heard about it from other people. I didn't watch it myself. Usually, TV series always show scenes of people yelling at each other. Then it’s “slap, slap.” They're always showing scenes like these. One man would have multiple wives, and these women would be jealous of each other. Their descendants would also be fighting. Then, not only these wives, but also other women who aren't officially registered. Then they’d meet his children, and they can’t get married. They’re always showing this kind of nonsense.

Watching these dramas is confusing and nerve-wracking. Why are there so many schemes and conflicts in families? Why not make a show about “The Story of Fan Wenzheng Gong?” Why not film these examples of good families for us to learn from? We should blame the people involved in education. Media universities don’t teach *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, nor do they teach ethical morals. Otherwise, they would understand that the media has an important principle, “conceal evil, and promote good.” Have you noticed that watching too many TV series causes paranoia? When your husband is five minutes late, you stare at him with wide eyes, “Why were you five minutes late today?” Then he takes off his coat and goes to the bathroom, and you quickly take his coat and check for long hairs. These kinds of scenarios. People watching these dramas are always talking about how horrible this man is and how shameless that woman is, and how unreasonable they are. Let me tell you, people watching the dramas didn't see the real cause. Who is the cause of the problem? The lustful man is the cause of the problem. If he didn't marry so many women, there wouldn’t be any conflicts, right? Look, when the situation becomes complex, everyone gets bogged down in the small details. They don’t know the root of the problem. Therefore, "Beautiful maids and alluring concubines are not the blessings of the boudoir.”

There was a family who hired a maid who was very beautiful and young. In the end, she became entangled with the husband. His wife couldn't bear it and injured the maid with a knife, and then his wife had to go to jail. So, it's not a blessing at all. What is it? It is bringing disaster. We should be very aware of these matters. We should not use our blessings to bring disaster to our family. That is not wise.

To be honest, if you want your family to continue successfully, you should avoid using servants if possible. Everyone should do what they can, I won’t force it. Zeng Guofan was the highest-ranking Han Chinese official in the Qing Dynasty. He was a governor-general of four provinces. But his descendants had to do all the housework themselves. He didn't let others do it for them. “Diligence and frugality are the foundation of managing the family.” If your children are served by others from a young age, it’s impossible for your family to prosper. I heard a few examples from the mainland of big bosses who, after listening to the traditional culture courses, really set an example by being diligent. It wasn't easy, and they made a big commitment, and their family fortune changed for the better.

【“Do not employ handsome young servants and maids. Wives and concubines should avoid wearing elaborate makeup.”】

In your household, do not hire servants, especially male servants, who are handsome and dashing. There are many cases of marital problems, where wives have affairs with their drivers. Therefore, male servants should be honest and trustworthy. However, people nowadays care a lot about appearances. Then, problems arise. When the problems occur, it’s too late to regret your decision. When you allow someone into your home, the first thing you should consider is whether they are virtuous. There is a saying that goes, “Bringing a wolf into your house.”

“Wives and concubines should avoid wearing elaborate makeup.” Wives should avoid wearing heavy makeup. Heavy makeup will attract negative influences, because women’s beauty can easily cause men to develop evil thoughts. This is something everyone needs to think about calmly. In the past, women understood how much influence they had on the morals of society. Therefore, their dress was very modest. They didn't want to cause others to develop negative thoughts. This intention was very valuable. Why did she think like that? She was thinking for the well-being of the entire society. Ladies, have you ever met a woman who told you that we women are responsible for the morals of society through our clothing? Have you ever heard of that? No? Then start with yourselves. If you do this, then the foundation of world peace will start here, in Malaysia! (Applause) We are very optimistic about this. The way women dress in Malaysia is very good. In this way, you won’t cause others to develop bad thoughts. This is a very valuable spirit.

**Notes on Translation Choices**

* **Clarity and Flow:** I aimed for a natural English flow, even if it meant slightly paraphrasing some sections to avoid sounding overly literal.
* **Cultural Context:** I’ve tried to maintain the cultural context. For example,  *jinshi* degrees and  *mu* were kept and explained where contextually necessary, rather than translating them directly.
* **Tone:** The original tone of the speaker is conversational, often using rhetorical questions and colloquialisms. I've attempted to retain this informality in English while keeping it clear and professional.
* **Idioms:**  I've chosen more readily understood English phrases instead of translating the Chinese idioms word for word where it would make the text awkward in English.

This translation should accurately and effectively communicate the meaning and spirit of the original Chinese text to an English-speaking audience. Please let me know if you have any other requests.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow while maintaining the tone of the original speaker:

**Translation:**

Let's calmly observe: wherever women dress more revealingly, the crime rate is invariably highest, and the proportion of women being harmed is also highest. At this point, we can't just blame the men, can we? We need to understand: even a hero finds it hard, no, a *real* hero overcomes it; it's men who struggle with the “beauty trap.” If he’s already having a hard time, and you're still dressing in a way that provokes impure thoughts, how can he possibly resist? Therefore, everyone needs to have professional ethics. If you go to work wearing something too revealing, all the male colleagues in the office won't be able to focus on their work, constantly drinking water and eating.

What was so admirable about the ancients was that every action, every word, was intended to have a positive influence and effect on society, especially for scholars. Look at Yan Zi, his clothes lasted for more than 30 years. He was a prime minister, and his frugality influenced the entire nation. Now, in mainland China, President Xi Jinping specifically promotes integrity and opposes extravagance and waste. The money saved across the entire country each day is immense; it truly benefits the people. If civil servants are not frugal and spend money carelessly, it’s all the hard-earned money of the people being squandered. A true gentleman, as described in the *Book of Songs*, is like "a blessing for the people" ("君子如祉"). The word “祉” means blessing. A gentleman, when he appears, possesses wisdom and virtue and can correct the errors of society and resolve the disasters of the people. As the saying goes, “the chaos and disasters can be quickly eliminated.” In the past, when people saw a good official arrive in their county, they revered and loved him like their own parents. When he had to leave, they would line the road for dozens of miles, crying and unwilling to let him go.

Zhuge Liang had wisdom. He married a wife who was different from others. His wife had hair that was more yellow and skin that was darker than most, but she possessed great virtue and learning. She was a tremendous help to his life's work, his morals, and his knowledge. They had a wonderful relationship; this is the kind of person who knows how to choose a wife. The sutra continues:

“[Although ancestors are distant, ancestral sacrifices must be performed with sincerity. Although descendants may be foolish, the classics must be read.]”

These words, as we hear them, are of great significance for our families and society today. This time is right around the Qingming Festival, and I am deeply touched that the Malaysian Chinese will all return home to sweep the tombs. This tradition may not even be as strong in Taiwan. The reason Malaysian Chinese are so blessed is not without cause. They often think of their ancestors, constantly aware that their ancestors came here from our ancestral land with hardship, overcoming many difficulties. We dare not forget their struggles; we constantly remember their kindness. If we remember ancestors who are so far away, how can we not be mindful of the greatest kindness we receive from our parents?

The ancients understood human nature and human relationships. Those who venerate their ancestors are kind and considerate and know how to “carefully remember the end, and trace back to the beginning,” and “when drinking water, remember the source.” By worshipping ancestors, filial piety was taught; by worshipping Confucius, respect for teachers and for morality was taught. The educational wisdom of the ancients was extraordinary. Now, we don’t worship our ancestors; we don't remember their kindness, so this teaching of gratitude and filial piety cannot be passed down. Malaysia has preserved many of the very good customs and very good spirit of the Chinese people. We hope these spirits will continue to be preserved, and even be promoted from Malaysia.

I remember many years ago, there was a counselor – an official from the Chinese embassy in Malaysia – who said he hoped many men in China could come to Malaysia to find wives. Do you understand the meaning behind this statement? It's about the virtue of the women; the virtue of the women of the Chinese race. He sees it in Malaysia. (Applause) Beyond applause, we must take responsibility. If you do well, you must come out and promote it. There is a book called *The Foundation for World Peace*, and it is about women's virtue; it is about the teachings for women. If you do well and integrate these principles, and promote this book, it will benefit Chinese families all over the world, and perhaps even families all over the world. Because Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country, and everyone's English is good, you can promote women’s virtue through English.

“A scholar must be resolute and strong, for his burden is heavy and his path is long.” You say, “I am not a scholar,” but you are reading these texts right now; how are you not a scholar? Those who hear the sacred teachings must take responsibility. “Although descendants may be foolish, the classics must be read,” because the classics enable people to understand reason and open their wisdom. Even if they don't have high academic qualifications, if they understand reason, they can manage their families in harmony and peace. But if they don't understand reason, they can easily bring disaster upon themselves. A person of Chinese descent wrote, “We are the most ancient culture in the world. With 5,000 years of educational wisdom and methods, why have we, in only a few short decades, become the most short-sighted people? It’s because we don't read the teachings of the sages and are polluted by utilitarianism, and so the entire nation has deteriorated severely.” When I see the phrase “the classics must be read,” I feel that it is indeed a very sincere reminder for every family.

That's all I want to share with everyone today. Thank you!

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow while preserving the original meaning and tone:

**Lecture 5: Remembering Our Roots, Honoring Ancestors; Upholding Filial Piety, Carrying on the Legacy**

Respected elders, friends, and parents, good day to you all! In our last session of the *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts* course, we happened to be discussing this:

"Though ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be made with utmost sincerity. Though descendants may be foolish, classic texts must be read."

Isn't it remarkable that we discussed this right around the time of the Qingming Festival? It feels like our ancestors are blessing us, allowing us to glean inspiration and wisdom from the classics they left behind. When we genuinely perform ancestral rites and then read these words, we should feel a deep resonance in our hearts.

I recall that in early 2006, on New Year's Eve morning, in Tangchi, Lujiang, Anhui, we, a group of roughly one hundred people, performed a joint ancestral sacrifice. About half of the participants were men. We were sincerely paying respects to the ancestors of all Chinese surnames, and we truly felt that sincerity can penetrate all things, that profound sincerity can move even the heavens. We felt that our ancestors had indeed come. Many of these men, more than half, broke down in tears, deeply moved. I was there myself, and I also shed tears. When we have this kind of personal experience and then look at the classics, as the *Doctrine of the Mean* says, that when one sincerely offers sacrifices to the ancestors, they are truly "as if they are above you, as if they are beside you." We don't just feel it; we experience their loving-kindness and their deep concern for us.

Personal experience makes a world of difference. Last winter solstice, we performed ancestral rites at the Minglun Hall, wearing Hanfu attire. One of our colleagues, surnamed Huang, was very devout and felt that his ancestor, Huang Xiang, was there receiving his worship. When he said this, I recalled an experience a few years ago in Malacca, at the Pay Fong Middle School, where I gave a traditional culture lecture organized by the Huang clan association. All the volunteers wore yellow clothing, a striking scene, with the four characters "Filial Piety and Respect for Teachers" written on them. They deeply cherish ancestors from one or two thousand years ago, so how could they forget the parents who are right before their eyes? That's why the *Analects* says, "Pay careful attention to the end of life and honor the memory of your ancestors, and the virtue of the people will return to being genuine." Where does this genuineness lie? In never forgetting the kindness of our parents, the kindness of others, and the kindness of our ancestors from thousands of years ago.

When we say this, you might wonder, what kindness have ancestors shown us from thousands of years ago? In your school days, you must have come across the term "Four Great Ancient Civilizations," right? Do you remember? The Four Great Ancient Civilizations were ancient Egypt, ancient India, ancient China, and the civilizations of the Mesopotamian region. If you think carefully, which of these ancient civilizations has continued to the present day? Only the Chinese civilization. China is the only remaining ancient civilization, meaning that the entire civilized bloodline of the other civilizations has been disrupted, and many no longer exist. However, our civilization has continued uninterrupted for five thousand years, and we are still a unified country. This is unique in the world.

Is this like drawing a supreme fortune stick before the gods, the one where civilization can be passed down while all the others are severed? Of course not. Nothing in the human world is accidental. There is a cause for every effect, and the effect then becomes a cause. The reason why we can study traditional culture today is the result of our ancestors passing down this beautiful civilization; other peoples do not have that opportunity. But our current study is a result, and it will also become a cause. If we study well, we can pass it down for another five thousand years; if we do not, it will be severed. Then we would be letting down our ancestors and future generations. Our ancestors also said that humans are one of the Three Powers – Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. To be the intelligent beings who stand alongside Heaven and Earth, and yet not remember our ancestors or our descendants—aren't we then disrespecting our dignity and our integrity as human beings? Therefore, to remember our origins, to continue the past, and to forge the future, should be the inherent duty of humankind.

The value of civilization and culture is something that this generation or the last two or three generations can better appreciate. For example, people in their sixties and seventies have many filial children. Among those in their thirties and forties, it's already becoming hard to find them. And our children? It's almost impossible, and cases of children killing their parents are on the rise. If we don't carry on our civilization, our Chinese nation will become the shortest-sighted nation in the world, from being the only long-lasting civilization. This phenomenon—in the past, when we read articles that said “Chinese culture is vast and profound,” we might not have felt anything. But in this era, precisely because culture isn't being carried on, the world's longest-lasting civilization, which generation after generation has produced sages, is now experiencing cases of children killing their parents. We must pass on the culture!

Speaking of this, the kind face of an elderly man comes to mind—Mr. Sim Mow Yu of Malaysia. I am fortunate to have met him several times. I recall personally visiting his home when he was ninety-five years old. He led us in singing patriotic songs against the Japanese invasion, playing the piano himself. You can never forget the image of this patriotic man playing the piano, his voice ringing out.

I remember that time, knowing I was an educator who had also taught at an elementary school, he said to me, "We teachers have the least 'money' future." He used a pun; teachers don't earn a lot of money. But honestly, what is the purpose of earning a lot of money? People who earn a lot of money often have more worries, right? Those who earn a lot of money tend to need sleeping pills. Farmers, on the other hand, don't have a lot of money, but they do their duty, planting in spring, growing in summer, harvesting in autumn, and storing for winter. They sleep well every night. By 8 or 9 o'clock they can go out and enjoy the moon and some peanuts. That's what real life is like.

We think we earn money to spend it, but actually, people are now being used by money, chasing after it relentlessly, and becoming slaves to it. In the end, people who earn money can't spend it. They work themselves to the bone to earn a pile of money, and who spends it? Their sons spend it, their wives spend it, or their wives' new husbands spend it, because the man works himself to death, his wife remarries, and doesn't the new man end up spending his money? That is why many people in this era cannot think things through. They are desperate to be slaves to their desires and slaves to money, which is not worthwhile.

Humans are the most intelligent of all beings. What is the greatest value of life? It's to improve our own wisdom and our spirituality. These are what we can take with us. Material possessions cannot be taken. We spend our entire lives trying to acquire them, and in the end, we can't let go of this or that. We become increasingly greedy, and our spirituality declines. This is demeaning ourselves. Scientists say that on average, a child laughs 180 times a day, while an adult laughs about 7 times a day. These figures show that people are living in a way that makes it harder and harder to laugh. Does anyone live in order to laugh less? Nobody wants to laugh less, but that is the reality. This is a contradiction. Humans live to pursue happiness, but the harder they work, the less they laugh. Isn’t this completely counter to their goal?

Have you ever met someone who laughs 180 times a day, with a smile as lovely as a baby’s? I have met several, including Ms. Hsu Che, who, at over 100 years old, shared her wisdom on this very platform. Her smile was like a baby's, pure and innocent. Is the face of a centenarian like hers the same as that of an average elderly person? The average elderly person has a mind filled with problems, unable to let go of things: my son-in-law doesn’t earn enough, my son isn’t rising high enough in his career, my grandson isn’t doing well in school—a multitude of worries. So, people live to the point where they cannot laugh. It is not worthwhile and shows that they’ve lost their way in life.

Why can’t people laugh? Why do their lives seem to become increasingly painful? Because they have changed their goals in life to pursuing desires, fame, and fortune. Desire is an abyss that can never be filled. The more one seeks, the more dissatisfied one becomes. And the more dissatisfied one becomes, the greater the pain of not getting what one wants. A child doesn’t have so much greed, do they? When you leave a baby on its own, it’ll giggle to itself. You don’t have to buy a lot of things for it; it'll be happy giggling on its own. Contentment brings joy. Children don’t have many desires. Can we return to our original simplicity, like children? If we can, I guarantee we’ll have far fewer wrinkles.

We also see that our teacher, who is eighty-seven years old this year, smiles just like a baby, his skin still flushed. That kind of life is so good. He also has profound wisdom, and wherever he goes, the leaders of the local countries ask for his advice. Yet, he doesn’t have many desires; he has let go of everything. He dedicates himself to the world and to the continuation of culture. This kind of life is joyful and meaningful.

Mr. Sim, at over ninety, is so open-minded. His life is without regret. He has been true to Heaven and Earth, to the country and the nation, and especially to the world of education. He is a pillar of the educational community, truly embodying the Way of the Teacher. Such a life will “leave a devoted heart to illuminate history,” illuminating the way of teachers in education and the continuation of Chinese culture in Malaysia. Therefore, Mr. Sim emphasized that while teachers may not earn much money, the profession is crucial, as it maintains the continuation of culture. In modern society, we can see how profound Mr. Sim's understanding of culture and Chinese civilization was. No wonder he was willing to risk his life to defend our cultural heritage. And isn’t it due to the persistence of such wise and venerable elders that the Han Academy is now being built in Malacca, Malaysia? It is, and this is something we must appreciate and remember.

If you look at other countries in Southeast Asia, you will see that the continuation of Chinese civilization there is precarious. In Thailand, the next generation no longer speaks Chinese. In Indonesia, it was severed for over thirty years. When we organized our programs, many participants from Indonesia were in their sixties and seventies, because the younger generation could no longer read Chinese. They were extremely worried, and their determination to carry on the culture moved us. They are taking on the mantle of cultural continuation at the ages of sixty and seventy. Even in Singapore, while they still study Chinese, what language is prioritized by the younger generation?

I remember the first time I went to Malaysia and was greatly moved when I gave a lecture on the *Rules for Students* at the Chen clan ancestral hall, because the Chen clan is a descendant of Emperor Shun, whom we in the study of traditional culture greatly admire. He was the epitome of filial piety among the twenty-four exemplars. During a break, some friends were exchanging business cards. One fellow took out a card that was entirely in English. Upon seeing this, the other person solemnly said to him, "Don't you have a Chinese name?" I was greatly moved and shaken by those words. How could the Chinese people of Malaysia cherish their own culture so much yet not even write their own names in Chinese on their business cards? However, looking back at myself when I was in junior and senior high school, I thought that speaking a few words of English made me superior. I, too, betrayed my ancestors, influenced by utilitarian values and straying from the right path for a long time. Later, I met my teacher and elders, and I realized that our ancestors had left the world’s most intelligent and profound civilization for future generations, which I did not cherish and even rejected. So, honestly, promoting this culture is a way of atoning for my past transgressions.

Throughout Southeast Asia, Malaysia is doing exceptionally well in carrying on this tradition. Our teacher is always pleased when he speaks of Malaysia. Recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama came to Hong Kong to seek guidance from our teacher. Our teacher mentioned that the Han Academy was being planned in Malaysia and spoke about the more than 1,200 Chinese primary schools and the 60 independent Chinese high schools that were doing well in preserving Chinese culture. He was filled with joy and said that the aim was to train talents in Chinese studies. The teacher encouraged Mr. Hatoyama to start a Han Academy in Japan as well. As you can see, our teacher takes every opportunity to encourage people to vow to preserve the culture. We need to understand that such a person has tremendous influence in Japan. If he stands up to promote Chinese studies, then countless people, even future generations in Japan, will benefit. Merciful people see things from a broad, long-term perspective; their hearts are vast enough to embrace all living beings.

Our teacher also mentioned to Mr. Hatoyama that China and Japan are of the same family. During the Qin Dynasty, Emperor Qin sent five hundred young boys and girls to find the elixir of immortality. But of course, there is no such thing as the elixir of immortality. In the end, their ships drifted to Japan, where they proliferated and became the Japanese people. They are, in fact, of the same lineage. The Koreans, too, are of the same lineage, the descendants of the Shang Dynasty. In the Han and especially in the Tang Dynasties, large numbers of Korean and Japanese scholars came to China to seek learning. At the time, Koreans and Japanese wrote their essays using Chinese characters. They were people of the same culture and lineage, and should therefore work together to propagate the culture of their ancestors.

We must understand that the propagation of Chinese culture is crucial to maintaining the stability of the world. In the 1970s, Professor Arnold Toynbee said that the solution to the problems of the twenty-first century lies only in the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and in Mahayana Buddhism. These form the three core components of Chinese culture: Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Professor Toynbee’s statement was very significant. He said "only," that only Chinese culture could save the world. Have you heard this statement before? You have, but has anyone heard it and been unable to sleep that night, saying, “I finally understand why I was born into this world. I came to save it!” You may well have come to understand the mission of your life.

This statement tells us that the children of the Chinese nation, in this great era, must shoulder the responsibility to save the world. Because we are Chinese, we have been educated in Chinese culture. Having received this education means that we possess the tool to save the world. To have this tool and yet remain indifferent is surely a sin, right? So, friends, there is no turning back. If you do not study hard and propagate culture, then you are guilty of standing by and doing nothing. Is not having a path of retreat a good thing or a bad thing? When people have no path of retreat, they will not fall from grace. When people have a path of retreat, they are not willing to take responsibility, and therefore cannot fulfill their duty as human beings. Before people learn the teachings of the sages, they often avoid responsibility. They are unable to teach their children, so they think “forget it.” When trouble arises at home, they are unwilling to shoulder it. They see chaos in society, and they turn a blind eye to it. Isn’t that how we end up living a more and more numb life? The Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—should be filled with passion, integrity, and a sense of responsibility.

So, when we see the statement, "Though ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be made with utmost sincerity," and we are the only ancient civilization that has been passed down, what does that mean? It means that our ancestors were people who accumulated great virtue! “Families that accumulate goodness will certainly have blessings.” Because their virtue was so great, it could protect their descendants five thousand years later. The other nations did not accumulate so much virtue, and their civilizations suffered a break. If you think carefully, you’ll see that of all the cultures in the world, our nation is unique in that it was founded upon ethics and morality. Go back and look at your family genealogy. There is not a single ancestor who was not a sage. The Cai family is a descendant of King Wen of Zhou. As I just said, the Chen, Hu, Tian, and Yao families are all descendants of Emperor Shun. The Lin family is a descendant of Bigan.

Our ancestors were sages, and that is why we are so blessed; otherwise, our culture would have been severed. The kindness of our ancestors has protected us. Shouldn’t we be grateful? We should. That’s why “Though ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be made with utmost sincerity.” When our teacher, Mr. Xu, discovered that his family genealogy had been preserved, and not destroyed or lost, his face lit up, saying, “Our family is from the second son of the Yellow Emperor. Leizu was the Yellow Emperor’s first wife. Their second son was Changyi, and our line has descended from the Yellow Emperor’s second son.” He was the 136th generation. I imagine that when we open our own family genealogy and connect to the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the hairs on our heads will stand up, why? We have found our roots. Our ancestors, generation after generation, passed down their bloodline, their culture, and their wisdom for five thousand years without interruption. Without our ancestors, where would we be?

When we never forget the kindness of our ancestors, when we truly carry on the culture, when we truly benefit the world and bring glory to our ancestors, then future generations will take us as their models, and we will have lived a life that is not in vain. So, everyone, today you should go home and do something very important: look up your family genealogy. Sometimes I meet people and, for instance, if they say that their last name is Zeng, I will say, “You are a descendant of Zengzi,” and they look at me bewildered. I want to pat their heads and say, “Go look up your family genealogy!” His ancestor was a good student of Confucius. He should quickly carry on the great virtue of his ancestor.

And we are so happy to see that in mainland China, governments at all levels, from the county level all the way up to the provincial and central levels, are placing great emphasis on ancestral rites. When leaders practice it, those under them will follow. Not only do they emphasize ancestral rites, but the entire national policy places the promotion of culture as the most important priority. This is a true measure of not just remembering our ancestors, but also of carrying on the wisdom of our ancestors.

Especially in this era, if we want to save the world, we must rely on Chinese culture. Life is short, a few decades. We must do meaningful things; we must do things that will benefit future generations. We cannot live in vain, then die and turn into dust. Isn’t that wasting our lives? Therefore, we should do the most meaningful thing, which is to carry on our culture.

We can see that Confucius dedicated his entire life to carrying on culture, which was a worthwhile thing to do. Over 2,500 years later, not only are we Chinese people grateful to him, but the entire world, including the United States, recognizes the birthday of Confucius as Teachers' Day. His great virtue has protected his descendants for over 2,500 years. I have met many of Confucius' descendants. I have heard that there are more than one million of them in the world. Not one of them is a prodigal son, which is truly amazing, isn’t it? Is that kind of family tradition worth learning? Yes. It’s what the *Book of Changes* calls “Carefully attending to the end of life and honoring the memory of our ancestors, so the virtue of the people will return to being genuine.”

Let me ask you all, compared to 2,500 years ago, when is it more difficult to carry on culture, now or then? Now, right? Does that mean the greater the difficulty, the greater the merit? It does. Then congratulations, you have an opportunity to establish great achievements! If you can pass on the culture with the spirit of Confucius in this era, then your descendants can continue for five thousand years. As it’s said, "All blessings are not apart from one's heart," if we "seek from our hearts," all can be achieved. To do what is difficult to do, and to endure what is difficult to endure, is to achieve complete merit.

So, in reading these words, we are reminded of the virtue of our ancestors. The education from our ancestors cannot but make us admire them. The nation that truly understands education is the Chinese nation. We have five thousand years of educational wisdom, five thousand years of concepts, five thousand years of methods, and five thousand years of results. What are those results? Generation after generation of sages. Even during the Qing Dynasty, there were many sages. The Chinese methods of education used art and great wisdom. If we look at our homes, the design expresses education. The architecture, the walls engraved with plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, and the artwork are all forms of education. What do they represent? When you step out of the door, you must associate with gentleman, associate with virtuous friends. Plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums represent the four noble plants. The image of a fan is carved at the door, reminding us to practice kindness.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, while also preserving the author's tone and intent as much as possible.

**Translation:**

When you enter a home, what does it signify when you place a bottle on one side of the entryway and a mirror on the other? It means that you should enter with a calm demeanor, not bringing emotions or temper inside, which would frighten the children. When you are calm, the family will be harmonious, and all things will flourish. You see, even the decorations symbolize wisdom and education.

I visited the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum in Malacca and saw bottles and mirrors right at the entrance. But I also noticed that in the homes of the descendants who had embraced Western culture, two different objects were placed: models of two animals. On one side was an eagle, and on the other, a bear that was nearly my height. What kind of feeling would these two items evoke upon entering? A sense of aggression. Isn't the culture different? Yes, it is. This brings to mind how, two or three hundred years ago, many Western nations rose to power and what did they do? They went around seizing other people's lands and possessions. Don't these two animals represent that? Because they saw these things every day, they were naturally influenced by them. What do these objects represent? Heroes.  Pay attention: the Chinese people revere those who are “benevolent and invincible.” They highly respect people like Fan Zhongyan, those who are truly kind. What do those cultures praise? They venerate those who invaded many countries, conquered vast lands, and had tens of thousands of people serving a single emperor. They call them heroes. That’s the idea of “one general’s triumph built on the bones of ten thousand,” their success built upon countless displacements, yet they celebrate them as heroes.

This is why modern Western civilization emphasizes competition, which then developed into war. Consequently, many powerful nations launched wars around the world.  But when the Chinese nation becomes strong, it spreads blessings and cultural wisdom to the world. Zheng He’s voyages to the West passed through numerous countries, and many places built Zheng He temples. Do you feel the blessings of our ancestors? How fitting that the Han Academy is built in Malacca, after six hundred years. This place demonstrates to the world that when Chinese civilization is strong, it brings blessings to the entire world. Malacca is proof of that. And where the Chinese people live, they can unite all races and religions without conflict. It so happens that the Chinese population is the majority in Malacca. This is not a coincidence; it's the arrangement of our ancestors.

Looking back, we see the wisdom of our ancestors' education, valuing ancestor veneration. What did they pass down through it? Ethics and filial piety. When families worship their ancestors together, many ancestral halls have these two lines inscribed: "Though our ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be performed with sincerity; though our descendants may be foolish, the classics must be read." We must remember and inherit from our ancestors; descendants must be well-educated. It's about "carrying on the past to open the future."  Through the act of ancestral sacrifice, they instilled the values of filial piety. When you are grateful to your ancestors, how can you not be filial to your parents?

Included in the process of ancestor veneration, those customs and practices—a colleague shared that when they worship their ancestors, the family makes dumplings. Northerners love dumplings. The first plate of steaming dumplings is brought out, and decades ago, when life wasn't as prosperous, seeing those dumplings made your mouth water. You would see the grandmother there, and she would say, "You can't sneak a bite, you must quickly present it to the ancestors." The child would then carefully and respectfully take the first plate to the ancestral shrine.  Do you think this child will not respect his ancestors? The second plate would be quickly brought to the elders in the family.  This is how ethics were taught.

I ask you, who gets the first plate of dumplings now?  That's where the problem lies. This reversal of priorities can be seen in these small details and practices. No wonder filial piety isn't what it used to be.  In the past, a filial child was one who was good to his parents. Now, “filial son” means one who is devoted to his own child. Things have been turned upside down. This cannot be.  The *Family Precepts of Zhu Xi* says, “When the moral order is broken, decline is immediate.”  When the proper ethical order is reversed, the family's prosperity will be ruined.  You see now, it used to be said that wealth doesn't last beyond three generations, but what about now? It can't even last one generation. Therefore, culture is profound and must be passed on. With just a ritual, they could pass down filial piety – that is no ordinary wisdom! How many civilizations today don't even have the word "filial piety" in their education? Yet, our ancestors have carried it on for so long, using such effective methods.

The second thing they taught was morality. How did they do it? They venerated Confucius. The Confucian temples teach morality. Every September 28th (Confucius's birthday), they worship Confucius, passing down morality. In the past, children studied in ancestral halls. From the ages of eight or nine, in front of the ancestors' tablets, they were taught to bring honor to their lineage, not to be lazy or fall asleep. When going to school, parents and elders of the family would first take the child to kowtow three times and bow nine times to Confucius. Confucius is the Supreme Teacher, embodying the way of the teacher. Then these elders and parents would lead the child to kowtow three times and bow nine times to their own teacher. In the child's mind, these elders and parents are the most respected people, and even they respect the teacher so greatly. How can the child not listen to the teacher's words? Thus, just with the ceremony of apprenticeship, children ingrained a deep respect for their teachers, which benefited them for their entire lives. Actually, when a child respects their teacher, who benefits? Isn't it the child who benefits? The teacher doesn't become any more full from a child respecting him, right? Therefore, the most important purpose of the ritual was to facilitate the learning of the next generation.

Now, think from another perspective. If you were sitting in the teacher’s seat and someone was going to bow to you, would you dare? Would you want that? I, as a parent, want to bow to you – just try it. From another angle, these people who are teaching are those who have read the classics. They wouldn’t even take advantage of others. How could they want people to perform such a great ceremony for them?  If you show them even a little courtesy, they feel very embarrassed and uneasy. How could they accept such a great ritual? But why do they accept it? Because they must carry on Chinese civilization. Because they must help that child develop an attitude of respecting their teacher throughout their entire life, they have no choice but to accept it.  The feeling of sitting there is like "sitting on pins and needles." Not just at that time, but when their ancestors, their grandparents, or even great-grandparents, or their parents performed this ritual. If the teacher who accepts the ceremony doesn’t teach well, how can they be worthy of that person's ancestors? How can they face their parents? Therefore, teachers in ancient times taught their students with more care than they taught their own children. They would not be happy if their own children achieved high marks, they were only happy if their students achieved high marks. Why? Because if their son was successful but their student was not, they could not show their face in public.

Therefore, teachers in ancient times did their best to teach their students. Students were grateful for the teacher’s grace, and they cared for the teacher's family and descendants as if they were their own. We used to read "The Anecdotes of Lord Zuo Zhongyi." Shi Kefa had great respect for his teacher, Lord Zuo Zhongyi. Every time he returned to his hometown, he would always visit his teacher's family and take good care of them.

Confucian temples teach morality; City God Temples teach karma and retribution. This left a deep impression on me. I live in Kaohsiung, and in Zuoying, Kaohsiung, there is the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas, the Spring and Autumn Pavilions, and the Lotus Pond. If you happen to be in Kaohsiung City, you can visit. There's also a Confucian temple in that area – it's a tourist spot. My house is right next to it. If I happen to be in Taiwan, welcome to come have tea, though I spend most of my time in Malaysia now.

Because I went to these cultural tourist areas as a child, I understand what the teachers were talking about. Our ancestors were so good at education. One City God Temple is more effective than perhaps thousands or even tens of thousands of police, because it teaches people from a young age that "evil deeds are punished, and good deeds are rewarded." So they wouldn’t dare do bad things. The younger you start teaching the better: “Habits formed in childhood become second nature.” When we were young and looked at the murals on the walls of the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas, depicting the stories of good and bad karma, it left a deep impression. We remembered the story of the man who made wine. When flies fell into his wine, he scooped them out, saving countless lives. Later, he was wrongly accused and sentenced to death.  Just as the official was about to write the execution order, a swarm of flies appeared, and every time the official tried to write, they would come back. The officials back then understood the reason, and they knew something was strange, so they investigated and cleared his name. So, the flies saved his life.

Thus, the *Geyan Lianbi* says, "All things are connected; sincerity and loyalty are the keys." Humans can connect with all living things, including plants and animals. With sincerity and loyalty, or doing their best, and with a connection to these lives, he does his best to save them. But what does the Creator hate most? "He despises harshness and cunning." Harshness is the opposite of heaven’s grace and life-giving kindness. Cunning is using cleverness to harm others, and this is what incurs the greatest retribution. The *Family Precepts of Zhu Xi* says, "Wealth gained through harshness will never last long," talking about harshness; "When trading with those who work hard, do not take advantage of them." If you haggle over a penny or two with a farmer who has worked so hard to grow vegetables, using words that force him to sell cheaply, that is not good.

In the course of my own growth, I happened to have the opportunity. The elders in my family also understood these things. They took us to receive these millennia-old teachings of art and wisdom. Confucian temples, ancestral halls, and even City God Temples - these are solemn places, equivalent to educational institutions. Thus, learning ethics makes one ashamed to do bad, and learning about karma prevents one from doing bad.  Today, when we teach about karma, besides the ancient stories, we also need to talk about modern examples. Because people today are quite stubborn and say, "Those were in ancient times; it's not necessarily like that today."

I heard Dr. Zhong Maosen mention an example of a girl, eighteen years old, still in the third year of middle school (equivalent to the US 9th grade). She wasn't serious about her studies and was involved in inappropriate relationships. One day, she was about to go out. Her mother was very worried and begged her not to go. The girl slapped her mother across the face and stormed out. She then went for a ride on a motorcycle with a man. As they passed a large truck, their motorcycle was pulled underneath. The girl’s hand, the one she used to slap her mother, was crushed and severed instantly. She died at the scene and the man was seriously injured. When the man regained consciousness, people asked him why he went under the truck. He said he didn’t know. The girl died instantly, but her severed hand was still twitching when her mother arrived. The girl had an older sister and a younger sister. Seeing the hand that had just slapped their mother lying there severed, they both vowed to never again be disrespectful to their mother, and they vowed to never get involved in inappropriate relationships. This is a real event that happened in our time.

Indeed, as we often said in the past, "Those who are not filial to their parents will be struck by lightning."  There was a story about two brothers named Xu in Longyou.  The brothers lived about 10 *li* (roughly 5 km) away from each other. The brothers took turns taking care of their mother, five days at the older brother's house and five days at the younger brother's house.  But the older brother was poor, while the younger brother was a bit more well-off.  This time, there were still two days left before the older brother was done caring for his mother.  He was out of food, so he had to tell his mother, "I have nothing to cook for you, you go to your younger son's house for now, and I'll make up for these two days later." The mother, seeing how her son was, was understanding. She went to her younger son's place.  But when she got to the younger son’s door, he wouldn't even open it. "There are still two days left. I won't let you in." The mother told him what her older son had said, that he would make up for the two days later. But he insisted on refusing to let her in.  At that moment, the mother could smell the aroma of cooked rice. She begged the younger son, "How about this, let me just eat, then I'll leave.”  He still refused.  Instead, he made his wife put the rice in bed and cover it with a blanket, so that his mother couldn’t even smell it.

So the mother left in tears.  Not long after she left, a thunderstorm struck, and lightning hit their home, killing his wife near the door and the husband in the hall.  The neighbors went over to see the house that had been struck and saw the couple dead, the rice still warm and covered in bed.  If the wife had been able to persuade her husband, they might have been able to avoid the disaster.  Therefore, husbands and wives should help each other on the path to virtue, not cause each other to fall. “Lead your wife towards virtue, and help your husband achieve good character.” Ladies, if your husband is filial, would you be happy or jealous? We need to know what is good, what is bad, and what is right and wrong. Jealousy shouldn’t prevail. A wise woman can bring prosperity to three generations. This was a story that happened in China.

On June 6, 1937, a newspaper in Shanghai reported a case of extreme immorality in the village of Solik in Poland. A young man of thirty-two years old had an argument with his mother over inheritance and killed her with an axe. He fled from the house, but was struck by lightning and died not long after. The locals all said that because he was so unfilial, he was struck by lightning. Even foreigners felt that those who were extremely unfilial would receive retribution.

When one of our teachers was telling a story about someone unfilial being struck by lightning, a fifteen-year-old boy became pale. The teacher went to him, seeing how pale he was. Concerned, she asked him why he was so frightened. He said that he had a classmate who was very unfilial, and that he had seen him struck by lightning and killed just tens of meters from him. So, when the teacher talked about that, he believed it. He said it was true that people could be struck by lightning. And from then on, he dared not be so harsh with his mother.

Therefore, education in karma is very important for people to have a sense of awe. Our entire nation, and indeed, the whole world has neglected education about karma, so people dare to do anything and fear nothing. Education about karma in family education, as well as school education and social education, is far too important.  We see many people doing terrible things, particularly those who are rich, indulging in all sorts of desires. It’s horrifying to see how they destroy people's lives and reputations.  They drive a car and kill someone and think that by paying some money, everything is okay. It’s so arrogant that it is simply unbearable.  All this comes from a lack of education about karma.

Therefore, in ancient times, “Though our ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be performed with sincerity.” The more sincere you are when worshipping your ancestors, the more filial your children will be, because children are very perceptive.  Ouyang Xiu, in his eulogy to his father, mentioned that every time his father thought of his own mother, he would shed tears. Every time there was good food at home, he would shed tears, lamenting, "Ah, my mother is gone." The more abundant the sacrifice, the less it is worth when a mother is not there. So this passage also reminds us that filial piety needs to be performed in a timely manner. Ouyang Xiu’s mother initially thought that her husband was so sad because his own mother had only passed away a few years before, but later, she found out that her husband was always like this throughout his entire life. Every time there was something good to eat, he would shed tears. So his sincerity moved his wife.

And this filial piety of his was so admired by his wife that she told the stories to their children.  Gentlemen, if you practice filial piety, loyalty, trust, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and it’s something your wife admires, and she then tells these stories to your children, your family education will surely succeed. When a son hears his mother talk so movingly about his father’s filial piety, loyalty, and virtues, how can he not respect his father? So, a man must be able to move his wife to be a true man. That sincerity towards parents and ancestors will definitely move your children.

I was raised by my grandparents. I have a deep impression of how my grandfather was so sincere when worshiping our ancestors, and he would also recite prayers.  Even though I was probably very young, I still remember it vividly. That respect for ancestors and even for gods and Buddhas, has long-lasting effects on children.  So when we grew up, we didn't dare to be disrespectful to Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist classics. I am also grateful to my grandfather for setting a good example.

"Though our descendants may be foolish, the classics must be read."  Even if your descendants are a little slow or less gifted, the classics must still be read. Because when people read the classics, they understand ethics, and they know how to behave and handle matters. In this day and age, this is very evident. A person with a doctorate degree may not necessarily know how to behave or handle matters.  We’ve all encountered those who graduated from graduate school who don't even know how to answer a phone, very arrogant. Ultimately, they made the people above angry, and they were investigated and then fired.  They couldn't even answer a phone. And this was a graduate student. A doctor returning from America directly said to his father, "Dad, I don't know when you're going to die, and you have so much wealth.  Give it to me sooner rather than later." The father was happy to see his son, a doctor, come home.  But as soon as he got back, he talked about inheritance. He was so saddened.  But his son didn’t sense his sadness. Seeing that his father didn't say anything, he placed an advertisement in the newspaper declaring a break in the father-son relationship. So, if a person doesn't read the classics, even with a doctorate, they might very well make their father die of anger.

So looking at this line, and observing today's society, we cannot help but admire the wisdom our ancestors left us. What leaves us sighing with regret, is how many of those who are now unfilial, harming others, and deceiving others are highly educated. These scamming groups, if they don’t have high educational backgrounds, they wouldn't be able to utilize their professional knowledge and computer skills. So what did people in the past cultivate?  "Character and learning, both excellent." Character came first. "Virtue and talent both cultivated.”  Virtue was to be emphasized. These idioms all have profound meaning, things have priority and must not be reversed. If one only has talent but lacks virtue, they are dangerous.  Having both talent and virtue is top-notch, and such individuals can create good descendants and people for society. But having talent and lacking virtue is very dangerous, both for the family and for society.

Sima Guang spent nineteen years writing a monumental work, *Zizhi Tongjian*. This book is so well written, summing up so much of history, so that people can learn lessons. One of the articles is about “The Discussion on Talent and Virtue.” How many families, even countries, have fallen due to children and officials who had talent but no virtue. So, seeing this line, and reflecting on today's society, many folk sayings and maxims, such as this one in Hokkien, "Good sons are a joy to have; bad sons are better not to have at all." If you have good descendants, you can relax and not worry. But if your children are ignorant and don't know how to behave, you will be there saying: "If only I hadn't given birth." It is too late to regret it.

But what's most important is education.  When children are born, are they not all innocent? Have you ever been to a nursery to see newborns? Look at them, and they are all so cute, right? Of course, first, we look at our own children, our own descendants. But naturally, other children capture your attention. Black children are cute, white children, Indian and Malay children are cute. Has anyone ever gone to a nursery and thought, “This one will be a murderer, that one will be a corrupt official?” No, that never happens. “At birth, people are naturally good;” “if not taught, that nature will change.” It is because they weren't taught well, they did not read the classics. Today’s education at school is focused on knowledge and skills. They don't read the classics.

We are also very moved by many people teaching in traditional culture units. They are not school teachers, but mothers, who voluntarily come out to teach the classics of traditional culture. They are worthy of respect. They don't go out to be teachers and promote culture; they have to be mothers, with many things to do. Yet they still take on the social responsibility of carrying on culture. And we, who teach in school and have the title of teacher, feel ashamed when we see this. They have even more responsibility than us for carrying on the traditions and culture. Many children, no matter if they are only eight or nine years old, we’ve seen children that age share what they’ve learned from *Di Zi Gui* saying, “I’ve learned that people should be filial.” If they are not taught, they will not know. “People who do not learn will not know.” He said that he used to only think of how to harm his mother. He resented his mother.

**Notes on the Translation:**

*   **Cultural Nuance:** I've tried to maintain a tone that reflects the speaker's deep respect for traditional Chinese values and the lament for the perceived decline in modern morals. I've also been careful to explain or contextualize some of the Chinese cultural concepts for a Western audience.
*   **Accuracy:** I have aimed for a word-for-word accuracy when possible, but prioritize clarity and a natural English rhythm.
*   **Tone:**  I've retained the conversational, almost lecturing style of the speaker.
*   **Terminology:** I've used English equivalents for terms like "City God Temple," "ancestral hall," and "kowtow" for clarity, but without losing their cultural significance.

Okay, here is my translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy, natural English flow, and a tone that reflects the original's passionate and concerned voice:

**Translation:**

So you see, without proper guidance, we don't know how far astray things can go. When we observe societal issues and then re-read these classic texts, we should quickly cherish the teachings of our ancestors. We should stand on the wisdom of five thousand years and see further. Our children, our descendants, should build their lives on this five-thousand-year foundation of wisdom. But what’s happening now? Right now, they’re learning utilitarianism, and the speed at which they’re degenerating is terrifying. I previously studied some theories that frightened me. These theories were all based on experiments using dogs, cats, and rats, and they are being used to teach people! Friends, what kind of people will you create by teaching them based on the results of animal experiments? If the goal is based on animals, we could easily become worse than animals, right? If you aim to be number one, you might accidentally get second or third, right? But if you set your standard at the level of an animal, of course, a large number of children in the next generation will be worse than animals. It's not an exaggeration. Even crows know to feed their parents, and lambs know to kneel to receive milk; but children today don't know how to be filial to their parents.

The great difficulties we are facing come from not having studied the classics. It’s because we "don't listen to the elders' words, and suffer in front of our eyes." Why doesn't anyone teach children moral stories? If we used "Moral Education Textbooks" to teach children, what would their standards be? They would be based on Emperor Shun, King Wen of Zhou, King Wu of Zhou, Emperor Yu, and King Tang – all sages! Their standard would be that of sages. If they learn from sages from childhood, what will they become? At the very least, they would be virtuous individuals, right? "Aim for the highest," and you might accidentally achieve the middle; "aim for the middle," and you'll at least be a gentleman. But now, they're taking animals as their example. It’s unbearable to watch. This is why we’ve lost our national confidence, learning all these foreign theories, leading education astray in such a terrible way.

"Even if your descendants are foolish, the classics must be read." To be frank, even if a child's inherent qualities are a little weaker, as long as they are willing to study the classics, their obstacles will slowly fade, and they will gain wisdom. In the "Moral Education Textbooks," we see that even someone who doesn't know a single character, by repeatedly bowing before the scriptures – the Five Classics, the Thirteen Classics – eventually gains enlightenment and can understand them all. Sincerity brings miraculous results. Moreover, the classics teach: if others learn something once, it doesn't matter, I will try a hundred times; if others learn something ten times, it doesn't matter, I will try a thousand times. If they cultivate this attitude, their foolishness will gradually transform into wisdom. So, with the classics, there is a way to recover their immeasurable wisdom and virtue.

Okay, that's all I want to share with everyone today. Thank you all!

Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining a natural English tone suitable for a book:

**Lecture Six: The Most Important Education for Children**

Esteemed elders and friends, good day! In our last discussion of the *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims*, we covered the lines, “Though ancestors are distant, sacrifices must not lack sincerity; though descendants be foolish, the classics must not be left unread.” We will now delve into the latter part:

[Though descendants be foolish, the classics must not be left unread.]

Even if our descendants are somewhat slow, they must still read the classics. In the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, it is mentioned that among the good deeds to be done is “upholding the righteous Dharma.” The classics embody this righteous Dharma. It states, “The Dharma is the eye of all living beings for all ages.” The truths within the classics are like the eyes of a person, capable of opening their wisdom, allowing them to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, and what is proper and improper. Let's pause and contemplate this in our modern era. I ask you, does someone with a doctorate always understand right and wrong? Not necessarily. High academic achievement doesn't equate to wisdom or moral clarity. For instance, there's the phenomenon of high divorce rates among those with higher education. Divorce is an irrational act. How can someone with so much education fail to analyze the impact of such a decision on themselves, their descendants, and their family? There’s a distinct difference between ancient and modern education.

In fact, the core of education hasn't changed for thousands, perhaps four or five thousand years. During the reign of Emperor Yao, those sage rulers were acutely aware of the human condition. People were “well-fed and warmly clothed,” and if they “lived in ease without instruction,” and were not taught moral principles, "they would become like beasts," causing "the sages to worry.” Our generation and the one before have been quite blessed. Have you heard of anyone starving to death? No. We’re well-fed. Have you heard of anyone freezing to death? No. We hear people buying designer clothes, not of anyone freezing to death. “Well-fed and warmly clothed.” And yet, the next generation often lacks life goals. They seem apathetic, not sharing household duties, simply wasting their lives and time. “Living in ease without instruction.” They are not being taught the principles of being a good human being. "They will become like beasts,” because their sole pursuit becomes the gratification of their desires. Today’s youth, no matter how much money you give them, will quickly spend it. If they are exposed to the seductive influences of the media, they might engage in inappropriate behavior at a very young age.

This statement, "Living in ease without instruction, they will become like beasts," was made four thousand five hundred years ago. Thus, education is crucial. The point is, in this day and age, perhaps 95% or more of people have completed junior high school, or even higher, yet very few know how to conduct themselves with proper decorum. But in ancient times, those who were illiterate understood how to behave, a fact that deserves our contemplation. People in the past might have been unable to read a single word, yet they knew the principles of how to be a good person. They understood the “five human relations and the eight virtues”. What about now? They are highly educated, but they might have no concept of these things. Therefore, the content of education in the past focused on teaching the five human relations and eight virtues, focusing on teaching “ethics and the norms of human relations.” This is from the perspective of educational content.

The goals are different, and so are the foundations. The goal of ancient education was clearly stated in *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims*: “Studying should aim at becoming a sage or worthy person." Let's set aside our descendants for a moment. I ask you, esteemed elders and friends, throughout your lives, during your education, did you have a clear understanding that “studying should aim at becoming a sage or worthy person”? If so, please raise your hand. Well, I can't raise my hand either, because I didn't know. None of us in this generation knew this, and what about the next generation? This is a very serious question. How could a principle that was known for thousands of years be completely unknown in our generation? This line from the classics has influenced people for centuries: “Studying should aim at becoming a sage or worthy person." But in our time, the overall societal trend is that “studying should aim at making money.” We’ve deviated. Subtly, we went astray. We should actually say, “Studying aims at achieving high scores, gaining academic qualifications, and ultimately making money.” We choose our major based on which field will earn the most.

If you think about it, hasn't this thinking gone awry? Everything is about personal profit. If someone becomes a teacher with the aim of making a fortune, how will he behave? That's a real problem; he will undermine the very essence of teaching. But people today see him with a big house and fancy cars, and they envy him. The person is destroying the path of teaching, and yet, we admire him. “A teacher transmits knowledge, imparts skills, and resolves doubts.” Teachers are engineers of the human soul. If someone becomes a teacher for the sake of making money, the consequences are unimaginable. Frankly, it's not just teachers, it’s every profession. Well, it's not "now." In my time, I often heard elders say things like, "So-and-so's child is earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in that field, quickly go study that major!" For several generations, money has been placed first, instead of the value of the work itself! A doctor’s role is to heal the sick and save lives; we cannot just look at the income first. A lawyer may make more money, and if he sees people wanting a divorce, he will hurry to facilitate that divorce, then his business will flourish. But there are many situations where he could have encouraged them to reconcile and avoid a divorce. The state of mind creates vastly different outcomes.

Confucius said, “This is why the classics must be read.” Confucius said, "The noble person understands righteousness, while the petty person understands profit." The noble person understands the moral responsibilities of life, while the petty person only thinks about how to selfishly benefit themselves. If we raise our children to pursue only profit, what kind of people will our families and schools produce? They won't be bad people, but they will be petty people. Bad people break the law, but petty people will drive their parents to their graves without ever breaking the law. They are completely ungrateful, yet the law cannot restrain them. Only morality can restrain them.

If teachers in schools are only motivated by money, what should we do? Should we be furious? No. People don’t know because they haven’t learned, and they do not understand righteousness. Honestly, even with our teacher training, we didn't get much exposure to ethics and morality, or the standards of teacher conduct. What did we learn? We learned teaching techniques, language instruction, and social studies instruction. The focus was heavily on teaching methods. Because in the current education system, the mainstream is heavily weighted towards science, technology, and scientific knowledge. However, if we think carefully, what have teachers been teaching for thousands of years? “Transmitting knowledge, imparting skills, and resolving doubts.” This is our current situation that we must understand. How can we adjust education back to the most important aspect, the “five human relations and eight virtues?” This is what our generation must grasp.

If we carefully examine the current educational landscape, we see how much the United States has influenced the educational direction of many countries. Yet, the US Secretary of Education has admitted their education system is a complete failure. How dangerous is it that so many people are following them? Sun Yat-sen said a long time ago that the West is superior to us in terms of machinery. Their political systems and education should, in fact, learn from China. It's strange; this important point is rarely mentioned. What we have instead is? Complete Westernization. We think the moon is rounder on the other side of the world. We have even adopted Western utilitarian education. As a result, although our descendants have the blood of the Chinese people flowing in their veins, what about their values? Utilitarianism.

In the United States, preschool education begins to teach competition. This was stated by a professor at an American university. Competition, when escalated, becomes struggle. Struggle, when escalated, becomes war. War, when escalated? That’s disastrous. Now we have nuclear weapons. We are headed down a dead-end path! In fact, there are many flashpoints around the world. If someone actually detonated a nuclear weapon, the entire world would be affected.

Therefore, forty years ago, Professor Toynbee stated that the solutions to the societal problems of the 21st century lie in the teachings of Confucianism, Mencius, and Mahayana Buddhism, in other words, the Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist education of Chinese culture. I am sharing this with you now, with utmost seriousness, that we must return to the wisdom of our ancestors and reintroduce these teachings. We have paid a heavy price, lost our national confidence. If more and more people understand this, then slowly we can adjust our course.

Take myself, for instance. I, too, studied and went to university. During junior high, my studies were also very intense. Sometimes I had six or seven exams in a single day. I even developed gastritis because of the stress of so many exams. Primary school, junior high, high school, university—sixteen years. I ask you, what important philosophical ideas did we learn in those sixteen years that are truly important for our whole lives? How much do you remember? We spent the golden years of our lives learning a lot of things, most of which were forgotten after the tests. Is this right?

Yet, it's strange, we never forget the things we learn from traditional culture. Because it's a study of the heart-mind; it aims at opening wisdom. Therefore, these principles resonate with our inherent nature, and we not only remember them but gain new understanding from reviewing them. The meaning of a statement when you are twenty is different from when you are thirty, and different again from when you are forty. It grows deeper and broader as we understand it. This is what is meant by, “to learn and then practice what one has learned, is that not a pleasure?” In middle school and university, I didn’t believe it. I thought, "Isn't studying very hard? Is it not torment to practice what one has learned? How could it be a ‘pleasure’?” Now I understand, truly, reading the books of the sages brings joy.

When I became an elementary school teacher, I didn't want to pressure students with grades, to the point that they become stressed and their development is impaired. I couldn’t do that. I, too, experienced stunted growth; I have always been slender, not very robust. Actually, I had the potential to be strong. My shoulders are quite broad, and I would have a good physique if I had been a little heavier. Now, as forty-year-olds, we must look ahead to the next generation or two. We have a responsibility not to let them repeat the detours and mistakes that we made in our lives. When I became a teacher, I never lost my temper or hit students. I would never say, “lose a point, and I’ll hit you.” I was subjected to that kind of treatment. After the test papers were distributed, "Cai Lixu, one hundred," I was so happy to get a perfect score. But then, shortly after, the teacher said, "Next monthly exam, lose one point and I will hit you." It was a bolt of lightning. I was sure to be hit. In the second exam, I got 91, and I was hit nine times. The memory is still very vivid.

To be honest, when I was in junior high, I felt that life was just so helpless. Why helpless? The children were being hit... some of my classmates had IQs of 150 or 160. My IQ was only 108. They were very smart and much more advanced than me. But, they were hit, hit, hit, until they didn’t want to study anymore. Many did not even graduate from high school. With such high intelligence, they were hit to the point that they rejected the teachers and lost their interest in learning. I am not blaming the teachers; I am simply saying that we are helpless. Our teachers did not even get weekends off. They would even bring their children to the office to do homework. They had so little time to spend with their families; they were so tired. Why was everyone so tired, yet the education system was not producing healthy people? This is very helpless, isn’t it? In the time of Confucius, he would take dozens, even hundreds of his students with him, and he didn’t need textbooks. They would travel and look at trees and he would begin to tell stories. It was a joyful and happy time. Teachers in private schools in the past did not use textbooks. They taught wherever they were. I would also like to have that ability, but it's because we only started learning these things in our twenties.

So we cannot blame the teachers for not knowing these ethical and moral principles. What is needed now? Don't blame anyone. Whoever accepts these ideas and understands them first, has the responsibility to introduce these good teachings from our ancestors to others. We can send DVDs to these teachers, send them to doctors, and they will gradually understand. Why? Because “at birth, people are fundamentally good.” They have not encountered a truly good influence. In a profit-driven society, it would take a sage not to follow the current trend.

As a result of the influence of Western utilitarianism, our goal in studying has become making money. While for thousands of years, our education goal was "to study to become a sage or a worthy person." As for the content of education? The “five human relations and eight virtues.” Especially our textbooks: the *Five Classics* and the *Thirteen Classics*. The foundation is “the natural bonds of human relationships,” teaching us how to be human beings.

Looking at the *Five Classics*, one of them is the *Classic of Music*, which has been lost. Only the "Record of Music" from the *Book of Rites* remains, but it is a magnificent work. Have you ever heard the guqin? The first time I personally heard a master from the Zhucheng School playing the guqin, I felt my entire body was being adjusted. I had previously read that the five tones of the Chinese pentatonic scale (Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zheng, Yu) corresponded to the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) and to the five organs (liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys). I understood the principle, but I couldn’t play. I didn’t know the guqin possessed such power. When he played, I felt very relaxed and comfortable in body and mind.

How has our country been governed for thousands of years? Through “rites, music, punishment, and governance.” "Rites," such as weddings, ancestral worship, and sacrifices to heaven, are all rites. "Music"; “punishment” meaning laws; and "governance" meaning politics. These are the four most important elements of governing a country. Music is also profoundly complex; one must put in the effort to understand it. But you need inner cultivation; it requires a lot of refinement because it’s truly a music of balance and harmony. That kind of music, even if you are feeling sad, after you play it, your heart will settle down. It’s very beneficial for one's moral cultivation.

What is the purpose of music education? You see, in the *Six Classics*, the function of music education is to "broaden one's mind, make one gentle and good." In ancient times, through the influence of music, people's hearts became very broad, and they became very compassionate. Pay close attention to the people in mainland China. Many ethnic minority people particularly love music, and the ordinary people are very hospitable and their faces are very pure, and their eyes are very bright. They are all influenced by their local folk music. Their faces are absolutely different from those of people who live in big cities. Right? Do people in big cities look like they are influenced by music? Yes, they are. Rock music! When they are not listening to music, they are a bit listless, and when they hear that, they start dancing. It has a bit of a numbing effect, and after they dance, they are very tired and empty. Music has good and bad aspects. It can be music that causes the downfall of a nation or music that governs the world, it makes a difference.

The teaching of rites, through the *Book of Rites*, “cultivates solemnity, frugality, and respect." It's about being very dignified, frugal, restrained, respectful and courteous. "Solemnity, frugality, and respect," are the results of the *Book of Rites*. The *Classic of Poetry* teaches, “gentleness and sincerity." This is the "teaching through poetry." See, gentle and yielding. Do our descendants today have these qualities? Sincere, "sincere" means very simple and kind, "gentleness and sincerity," this is the “teaching through poetry.” The *Classic of Changes* can be used to calculate a person's destiny and even the fate of the entire nation. It teaches “purity, stillness, and precision," this is the “teaching through the *Changes*." Look, one's mind is very calm and still. “Precision” means one can take preventative measures, and have foresight. Children today only think about how to fulfill their immediate desires. How can they think that far ahead? These classics are what our ancestors left for us.

Including the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, which Confucius composed, it teaches "to draw parallels between historical events.” From the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, one can understand the benefits and drawbacks of historical events. This way, one will use thousands of years of history as a point of reference, and therefore develop good judgment. Where did this ruler go wrong? Where did the father go wrong? Where did the son go wrong? Many people today are unable to judge right and wrong.

Including the *Classic of Documents*, it teaches "to be clear and farsighted." The *Classic of Documents* records the teachings of ancient sage kings, so one can understand how to handle many matters, the wisdom behind harmonious governance, one will understand. In fact, the most insightful political philosophy in the world should be in the *Classic of Documents*. For instance, the *Classic of Documents* says, "Do good, and you will be blessed with a hundred fortunes; do evil, and you will incur a hundred calamities." Knowing the reasons, you can understand the fate of individuals, nations, and society. Honestly, this sentence from the *Classic of Documents* can solve the problems in our society today, don't you think? "Do good, and you will be blessed with a hundred fortunes; do evil, and you will incur a hundred calamities." Doesn't it explain where the problems of the world come from? They come from people's lack of kindness; we have identified the root cause. If people's hearts become kind, all of these problems will be solved.

Frankly speaking, we don't really understand these things very well. These things are so good, but our understanding is too limited! We absolutely cannot let our descendants have such limited understanding as we do, because they must lay their foundations right now. It's a shame we only started learning this advanced wisdom so late. We cannot let our descendants go through the same regret.

So “the classics must not be left unread.” Reading the classics, you will understand how to conduct yourself, and be able to judge right from wrong. And among the timeless truths in the classics, let’s mention the simplest: the five human relations, the five constants, the four pillars of society, and the eight virtues. The five constants, this word “constant” is very important. They are the constant path; they will never change. In the *Zuo Zhuan*, it says, "When people abandon the constant path, then bizarre phenomena arise." When people abandon this constant path of how to be a human being, then all sorts of strange phenomena occur.

For example, there is a global financial crisis. This is a huge problem, right? The five constants are "benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness." It is because of deviations from the five constants that we have a financial crisis, right? First, did those who caused the financial crisis think of others? No, not "benevolent.” They only wanted to gain a lot of money without working for it, which is not “righteous.” They live a lavish lifestyle, because they made money so easily, which is not "proper.” They made money in a way that violated truth, they were accumulating sin, they lack “wisdom.” Those people will have very miserable lives in the future. They are also not “trustworthy.” If the five constants are abandoned, it causes huge problems. This is a worldwide problem.

Another recent problem, why are divorce rates so high? It’s because of the lack of the five constants. Do they think of the other person? “Benevolence.” Do they put themselves in each other’s shoes, and are they understanding? "Righteousness." Now they want prenuptial agreements before they are married. How is there any “righteousness” in that? "Propriety," it’s about valuing one’s own reputation and chastity. This concept is now gone. Men and women do not respect each other. There is no “propriety.” They get a divorce for any reason, they are too emotional, no “wisdom.” “Trustworthiness.” They have forgotten the vows they made to each other. So is it related to the five constants?

In organizations and between rulers and ministers, why is the turnover rate so high? Does the leader possess the five constants? Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. They must truly care for the people under them. Just like it says in the maxim we will discuss later, “When bargaining with a peddler, do not take advantage.” We should think of even the small business owners; how much more should we think about our own employees? Our employees trust us, and their families and parents trust us. We have a responsibility to look after them. Now what has it become? In the age of utilitarianism, what do they treat people as? As tools on a production line. They are not treated as human beings. We need to reflect. These are all extremely biased value systems. They are influenced by utilitarianism. What are they learning? I want to earn more profit. So they are calculating costs. Do they consider that by continuing to earn so much money, their employees are under too much pressure, may jump off a building, or even have dozens jump off? Do they care about that? Frankly, if I were the boss, if one person jumped off the building, I wouldn’t want to run that business anymore. I created an environment where someone would jump off a building. I would shut it down, even if I could earn a hundred million dollars a day, I wouldn't want to, because life cannot be bought back with money.

But looking carefully, many companies, I remember some time ago, in the news, some tech executives in their forties suddenly died from overwork. Several in a row in a few weeks. Later, we found out that those industries were too demanding, they often stayed up all night, and they didn’t realize the consequences of their overworking. They eventually died from exhaustion. Some companies even say, "You want my money, I want your life." Working at those companies, people feel like what? “I’ll keep pushing myself, I’ll keep pushing myself.” They push themselves until they are forty, then they stop, and they will have saved enough money to retire.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I have aimed for clarity, accuracy, and a natural English flow, while also retaining the tone and intent of the original.

**Book Translation:**

Planning to retire at forty is wishful thinking; it's a bit against nature to earn money that way. In the end, that money will all go to the hospital. Why? Because you've ruined your health.

Let me give you some examples of “broadness towards subordinates.” “Broadness” means treating those below you with great kindness and compassion. As the *Di Zi Gui* says, “Though noble, be kind and broad-minded.” In the past, when families had maids, what were their thoughts? They would think, "I need to teach her well so she can marry into a good family later.” They would be concerned about her future.

Madam Luo, the wife of Mr. Yang Wanli of the Southern Song Dynasty, would wake up very early in the winter, even in her seventies, to cook hot porridge in the kitchen. She wouldn’t let any of her servants go to work until they had all drunk some. Her children, seeing this, couldn't bear it. "Mom, you are already in your seventies and the weather is so cold. Why bother?” Her mother replied, “These servants are all children of other parents.” Thinking empathetically, they were all raised by their parents and were their precious darlings. “It is so cold in the early morning; they must have some warmth in their stomachs before they start work, or it will be very damaging to their health.” She was very considerate towards those under her. She had four sons and three daughters, and she breastfed all of them herself. Why? She said that if she had others breastfeed, she would be stealing milk from other families’ babies, and she wouldn't do that. She did it all herself. Three of her four sons passed the imperial examination to become *jinshi* (scholars), and it was difficult for even one person in a village to become a *jinshi*. She had three out of four, see how great her blessings are? The greater your generosity, the greater your blessings. She was always thinking of others.

Therefore, the relationship between the whole group or company is like the relationship between ruler and subjects. A leader must embody benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. There was an entrepreneur from Guangdong who I was very moved by his sharing. He had also accepted traditional culture and understood deeper aspects of life. He said that he used to think that he was making great contributions by paying so much tax to the government. However, after learning traditional culture, he thought about things more deeply and broadly. He realized he had failed society, because even though he was paying taxes to the government, he had not paid attention to the education of his employees. Many of his employees came from the countryside, traveling thousands of miles to this economically developed area of Guangdong. After coming so far from their hometowns, these young people picked up many bad habits because he did not educate them. They ruined their health and spent lavishly, hardly sending any money back home. After three or five years, what was sent back home was a child who had become morally corrupt. How could he face those families? And these people are all the masters of our country. How could he face the country? You see, he used to only think about how much money he paid in taxes, which was very short-sighted. His words moved many entrepreneurs, and now many entrepreneurs are transforming their companies into schools, providing traditional culture classes for their employees.

In Nanjing, there is a company called Phoenix, and the president, Mr. Li Musong, is a very virtuous elder. At the time when we were in Lujiang, he personally drove his employees several hundred kilometers from Nanjing to Lujiang for classes on Sundays. Why did he drive himself? He said that drivers also have families and should be given time on Sundays to be with their families and rest. He was also very considerate of those under him, which is why his business was so successful. His employees said that sitting in the car, they couldn’t help but wonder if the president was trying to brainwash them. If you were a boss, and you had put so much effort into having them learn, and they still suspected your motives, how would you feel? You would feel sad, wouldn’t you? You would feel sad. Why do you feel sad? Because you hope they can understand your good intentions. If you don’t have such expectations, you won’t feel sad. So it is not that they are making you sad, it is your expectations that are making you sad. Understand?

There is a story: Suddenly, the wind blew and a banner moved. One person said, "The banner moved." A second person said, "It was the wind that moved." Finally, a wise person said, "It is not the wind that moved, nor the banner that moved, it is the heart of the benevolent person that moved.” This is very true; whether or not an incident causes you to lose your temper is not determined by the incident itself, but by your own cultivation.

Let me tell you another story. There was a Singaporean couple whose relationship was very good. The classics say, “A harmonious marriage,” and their relationship was as harmonious as “the sounds of the zither and lute.” That is, the conversations between a loving couple are very pleasant and warming to hear. I really felt this way, because the husband would say that his greatest blessing was marrying his wife, and the wife would say that the luckiest thing for her was marrying her husband. Listening to them made people long for such a harmonious atmosphere.

Then, the husband said something quite interesting. He said that sometimes he felt very sorry for his wife. Why? Because when his mother misunderstood his wife, and started scolding her, his wife would kneel down to apologize to his mother. Even though his mother had misunderstood his wife, his wife still knelt down to apologize. He said that when he saw that, he felt that his wife was being very wronged. Ladies, do you feel wronged? When you are misunderstood and still kneel down to apologize? From your expressions, you don't seem to think it’s wrong. Because you have been learning traditional culture from our ancestors for many years, you have built a strong foundation and have developed your character. The average girl, upon hearing this, would immediately say, "Humph! How outrageous!”

However, after her husband finished speaking, his wife immediately said, "I don't feel wronged at all, because when I see my mother-in-law getting angry, I think, the old people are the treasures of the family. If she gets sick from anger, what should we do? I only think about how to quickly help her calm down, so when I kneel down to apologize, her anger immediately subsides, and I feel at peace."

Everyone should take the time to really reflect on these stories. I ask you all, is the story over? No, it will continue to unfold. Will the misunderstanding be cleared up? In a couple of days, will the mother-in-law realize, “Ah, I misunderstood my daughter-in-law." Sometimes, you've forgotten where you put something, but then you scold your daughter-in-law. Suddenly, two or three days later you say, “Oh, I put it here; I was wrong to scold my daughter-in-law.” When she realizes that she was wrong and had lost her temper, yet her daughter-in-law still knelt down to apologize, this kind of daughter-in-law is a real gem! She would love this daughter-in-law even more. So, taking a loss is a blessing. As it continues to develop, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would become like a mother and daughter.

But what is the essence of this daughter-in-law’s actions? Why does she not feel wronged? Why does she not feel sad? Why does she not lose her temper? Because she is not thinking of herself. The moment you think of yourself, "I am being so wronged, I am taking such a loss, I can’t bear this," then you will have emotions. She only thought, "I must quickly calm the old woman's anger." She was not thinking of herself, so she didn't have those emotions. Where does people’s anger come from? From taking oneself too seriously. "How dare you talk to me like that? How can you treat me this way? I have always been so good to you!" This is where the anger comes from.

The main point of today's story is to tell you all that if you understand this, from today onwards, you can become a person who doesn’t get angry. Is this good? Do you want to live this way? Whenever you are interacting with someone, the moment you are about to get angry, immediately change your perspective and think of the other person first instead of yourself, and your anger will subside. The more you think about yourself, the more the fire will "boom," and erupt like a volcano.

For example, Mr. Li’s subordinate doubts his motives even though Mr. Li is being so considerate of him. If you were thinking from the perspective of this employee, what would you feel? You would feel they are so pitiful, after living for so long, they still doubt others so much. How exhausting is that? When you see someone who often doubts others, you should think about how tiring their lives must be. How can we help him put down the burden of doubt, so that he can be less miserable? How can we reduce his doubt? By setting an example, we can reduce his doubt. See how the boss changes his perspective, and takes a deep breath, and wants to turn the situation around. It’s true, if a person has paranoia, their life cannot be equated with happiness. So, people who learn traditional culture should become more courageous the more they are doubted, letting them see that over time, one’s true intentions will be revealed. There really are people who have nothing but good intentions for them, such as close relatives and friends like you, and this will help them develop faith in people. Not only will you not be sad, but the more people doubt you, the more motivated you will become. So you see, it’s all in a single thought; happiness and suffering are in the difference between enlightenment and delusion.

Friends, are you suffering right now? Have you been sad for several days? Is there something you can't let go of, and it feels like a tangled mess that even appears in your dreams? Don't think too complicatedly. Change your perspective, and the suffering will disappear, if you are willing to act according to the classics. How is the suffering created? “Bringing trouble on ourselves.” That’s right. Change a thought and you are awakened. Why do we insist on holding onto wrong ideas and concepts? If you don’t believe this, I'll use a line from the *Di Zi Gui* to immediately turn suffering into joy. Do you believe me? Only if you believe, will what I'm saying have any effect. "When you are given kindness, seek to repay it; when wronged, seek to forget it." Put these words in your heart and put them into practice immediately, and your life will be instantly transformed. Right now, let go of any resentment, and immediately think of the good qualities of that person, and they will not seem so annoying anymore. Instead, you may even find them a bit endearing. So it’s not their problem. It is not the wind or the banner that moved; it is the heart of the benevolent person that has moved. Our ancestors were very wise and found the root of the problem. There is no point in trying to address only the superficial symptoms; it will not solve the problem.

For example, one of our students was so scared by her teacher as a child that when she introduced herself, her expression still reflected the lingering fear. From this, we should reflect whether anything that we said or did made a friend or relative still tremble with anger when they think about it. If so, we must quickly apologize to them, otherwise, we will be greatly diminishing our own virtue. Has anyone told you, "Whenever so-and-so talks about that thing, they get so angry that they tremble." Has that ever happened to you? You all haven't, you are all truly good descendants of our ancestors. After learning these principles, you all immediately repent and quickly apologize to the people you should apologize to.

I shared with this student that when you think about it and you feel nervous, this is a problem. You should turn the problem into wisdom, into *bodhi* (awakening). Turn the problem into the motivation for your life. This experience has given you a very important inspiration: that you should pass on this culture and become a good teacher, revitalizing the role of a teacher, and that is what this experience is telling you. After such a shift, it completely turned into motivation. Moreover, after such a shift, you are now dedicated and selfless, following the spirit of Confucius, and you also take the initiative to visit this teacher every year with a gift. When the teacher realizes that he had once pushed you to transfer schools, and yet you are now treating him with such respect, people all have a conscience. Later, when he learns that you are selflessly promoting Chinese culture, you will have created a very positive connection. So no matter what kind of connection, the ultimate goal is to transform it into a good and positive one.

Conflicts in the ruler-subject relationship can be traced to the same issues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. This also includes the subordinates – are they thinking empathetically from the leader’s perspective? Being a boss is not easy; being a leader is not easy. It is only when you have been through it, do you know how difficult things are. In the past, when we were working in a company, we often thought: this leader didn't do well here, and that leader didn't do well enough there. It was only when we became leaders ourselves that we realized how difficult it is. This is why we should not be too harsh in our words.

For example, it's only when you become a parent yourself that you understand how difficult it is to be a parent. Only after raising your children do you understand the kindness of your parents. However, during the course of our growth, have we ever complained about our parents? When you are able to empathize, you will not regret not knowing. It is a bit too late if you only start being grateful after going through it yourself. If we had understood the hardships of our parents from a young age, we would truly be our parents' warm coats, bringing them warmth and always understanding them. Such people will also always understand their leaders when they start working in a company.

“Righteousness” – do the subordinates have a sense of loyalty to the leader and to the company? “Propriety” – should respect the leader, and not be impetuous when speaking. “Wisdom” – you must use wisdom when handling matters, do a good job and not end up being “more destructive than helpful.” Today, it’s true, without these qualities, what happens to a secretary? A secretary could end up becoming the boss's boss. That’s what is happening. A secretary should be thinking of many things for the boss; they should help keep track of the things the boss might have forgotten. But what is happening is that now, the boss has to ask the secretary, "How are you doing with that task?” Doesn't that mean that the boss has become the secretary’s secretary? It’s backwards! You must also be “trustworthy”; you should do everything you can to complete what you have promised to your leader, no matter how hard it is.

You see, these five constant virtues can solve all kinds of problems, whether they are world problems or issues between people. And the principles behind these five constant virtues can all be found in the classics. How can we not read them? They include filial piety, respect for elders, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, benevolence, love, harmony, and peace. There are two interpretations of the Eight Virtues, and combined, they become the Twelve Virtues. If we carefully think about it, if we achieved these twelve virtues, would all the problems in families and society still exist?

“Filial Piety” and “Respect for Elders” – would there still be conflicts in the family? “Loyalty” – would there still be people changing jobs frequently or embezzling money? Would there still be people trying to bring down their entire company? “Trustworthiness” – would there still be fraud and tainted food? “Propriety” – would there still be conflicts between family members and people in society? Nowadays, not only are people rude, they will beat you to an inch of your life if you upset them. “Righteousness” – if people were loyal and righteous, how could there be so many divorces? How could there be so many people who betray others for personal gain? “Integrity” – there would be no corruption. “Shame” – people would not do shameless things. “Benevolence, love, harmony, and peace” – the world would be in harmony. Therefore, “the classics must be read.” Only then will people know how to conduct themselves and open the eyes of wisdom. Next, the classics say:

【In your personal conduct, always strive for simplicity and frugality. In teaching children, follow righteous principles.】

In our daily conduct, we should always have the principle of "simplicity and frugality," meaning being thrifty, practical, realistic, not superficial, not showing off, and not competing with others. In the section we have read in “Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims,” how many times has frugality been mentioned? “With every bowl of porridge and every spoonful of rice, always think of how it has come; with every half thread of silk and every piece of cloth, always remember the difficulty of obtaining materials.” “Do not build lavish houses, do not seek fertile lands.” “Utensils should be simple and clean, earthenware is better than gold and jade; food should be plain and refined, garden vegetables are more valuable than delicacies.” All of these advocate frugality. Therefore, these sentences are telling us, "Diligence and frugality are the foundation of managing a household." Without frugality, the family will surely decline.

And this frugality is not just about frugality in financial matters; it can also be applied in many aspects of how we conduct ourselves and interact with others. Therefore, in the *Five Instructions*, there is a section called *Instructions on Customs*, which mentions that people’s blessings are cultivated by themselves and are predetermined. Therefore, people who cherish their blessings will always have blessings to spare. This is why we have the spirit of "may there be abundance every year" during the Chinese New Year. Do not be extravagant; do not squander your blessings. People who waste resources are likely to quickly exhaust their blessings. And our ancestors told us, “When your blessings are exhausted, you die.” If a person spends their blessings too recklessly, even if they were meant to live to be eighty years old, if their blessings are used up when they are fifty, then they will die, losing thirty years of their lifespan. If they were only meant to live to be sixty, but they are particularly frugal, and when they reach sixty, they have not spent all their blessings, they might extend their life by twenty years. These are all the teachings of our ancestors.

Lao Tzu taught us that he had three treasures: The first was “compassion,” benevolence; the second was “frugality;” and the third was “daring not to be first in the world,” which is being humble and modest. Lao Tzu gave us these three treasures for life, and "frugality" was one of them. This “frugality” is not just for when we use money. In all of our interactions, we should have this spirit of frugality.

For example, with eating, we should also have “frugality in eating.” Because eating too much puts a particularly large burden on the spleen and stomach. Nowadays, many people have problems with their spleen and stomach, which is related to eating. Diet should be in moderation, and we should eat less for dinner. Of course, we need to take a step-by-step approach when changing a habit, and not be impatient. My mentor, for example, essentially doesn't eat dinner, and yet he looks very healthy. “Frugality in eating.” Especially after seven o'clock, we should not eat anything. If you eat too late, it won’t be digested properly, and the food will fester in your stomach overnight. People who eat late-night snacks often have bad breath, because the food hasn’t been digested, and then when you sleep, the stomach also goes into a state of rest, and the stomach is not at rest properly. Have you sensed that your stomach is protesting? It is just not putting up a white flag, is it? You're not letting it rest properly.

“Frugality in desires can concentrate the spirit.” We shouldn’t have too many desires and hobbies, as they can scatter our energy. Has everyone ever felt that when you cannot do something, you will feel very upset, that your energy cannot be concentrated, and that you will keep thinking about it? For example, a person who gambles loses focus and only thinks about gambling. For example, people who really like buying clothes, as soon as they see the clothes that the model is wearing, they spend the next several days saying, “I need to go to the department store right now.” Their energy is scattered. Because that desire is controlling them, they can’t focus on doing things at any given time. Similarly, when children really like playing video games, they cannot concentrate in class, and they just keep thinking about wanting to play games. It’s the same for people who really like watching TV. Isn’t that true? If there is a program they like, and you ask them to read, they will still be thinking about the program, even though they are sitting at their desk. Thus, “frugality in desires can concentrate the spirit.” The fewer desires you have, the better. When you have let go of your desires, you become free and happy. No desires will be able to control you.

“Frugality in speech can nurture qi and avoid trouble.” “It is better to speak less rather than more,” this is frugality in speech. Speaking too much expends too much energy, so avoid speaking too much in order to nurture your qi. Moreover, speaking too much can lead to mistakes, and you can easily cause a lot of trouble. Also, when you talk a lot, your heart is often very restless and cannot be still. Otherwise, we would only speak when it’s truly necessary to speak.

Furthermore, “frugality in social interactions.” “Social interactions” mean that you shouldn’t make a lot of friends. The most important thing about friends is that they are close friends and trustworthy friends, who can help each other grow in virtue. Don't just make a lot of friends and neglect your family. What is the point of having a meaningless sense of vanity by saying, “I know so-and-so; I’ve eaten with so-and-so.” It will only cause you to neglect the fundamental responsibilities of your family. People who focus on vanity and appearances are really living empty lives. So people shouldn't think that they need to make lots of friends. The most important thing is to be careful in choosing friends. "Choosing friends is like seeking a teacher.” It is as important as finding a good teacher. Because especially after we are adults, we are very easily influenced by the friends we are surrounded by. The *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* says, “If you are intimate with bad people, you will eventually suffer; if you are respectful to the wise, you will be able to rely on them in times of trouble.” You should make more friends with wise and mature people. Often when we are being impulsive, their opinions will be different from ours and they will be able to calm us down. These friends are important. We can carefully choose our friends and because we are very careful in making friends, we won't make bad friends, which could lead to misfortune and mistakes. This is called "choosing friends to reduce mistakes."

“Frugality in social engagements will help to nurture health and reduce fatigue.” This means if you can decline a social invitation, then decline it, and your health will be better, and you won't be so tired. I once met some government officials. Their lives were not fit for human beings. By the time we finished having dinner with them it was already past 10:00 pm, and they still had three more places to go. They were probably meant to live to be 80, but they lost many years off their lives due to the stresses of being a government official. It was very exhausting. In fact, as long as the businesses are run based on trust and righteousness, those who cooperate with us will trust us more and more.


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and an appropriate tone for a self-help/moral teaching context:

**Translation:**

It's not about the kind of trust that requires getting completely drunk together, or even going to inappropriate places. That's utter nonsense! You shouldn't earn money that way. Really, you can't make that kind of money. How can you face the families of those people if you lead them astray? Their ancestors will come looking for you! Your blessings are yours; they don't need to be earned by taking people to such places. People who lack understanding engage in actions that create negative karma. Your rightful blessings will come to you regardless. We should use honest means to earn a living. In fact, in the process of earning, you're accumulating merit again. Because your words and actions are aligned with morality, you're accumulating new merit. That's the right way to go. If you take unethical paths, you're depleting your own blessings even while making money. That's what it means to be a petty person doing petty things.

“**Be frugal with alcohol**,” which is to say, it’s best to drink less or not at all.  The later scripture also says, “Do not drink excessively.” This is all talking about how this “allows you to purify your mind and nourish your virtue.” Drinking too much clouds your mind and makes you lose control, which is not good.

“**Be frugal in your thoughts, and you can dispel worries and troubles**” meaning you shouldn't engage in wild, random thinking. In your daily life, read classics more often, calm your mind, and avoid excessive thinking. What do people think about these days? They are consumed by thoughts of the past, the future, and the present. The past is gone; learn from your mistakes and move on. Don't dwell on it to the point of getting angry and worked up – you’re just inflicting pain on yourself. The future hasn't arrived yet, so don't worry about it endlessly, right? And is there a connection between the future and the present? Yes, there is: “To know what the future holds, look at your present actions.” You reap what you sow. Daydreaming is a waste of life, isn’t it? Those who constantly think about the future are also wasting their time and energy. Then there are present-day delusions. What does that mean? Being indecisive. Is this good? Is that good? You are constantly pondering, furrowing your brow, and wasting your energy.  *The Rules for Students* says to do what it says, *The Analects* tells you how to act, so isn't it easy to act accordingly? You have a standard, and your decisiveness is strengthened.  Why are there so many things that cause hesitation? When you're facing indecision, discuss it with someone who studies traditional culture. "The one involved is confused; the observer sees clearly." Don’t just think about it, and think about it, getting stuck in a rut. There's no point. This is where having a good friend you can rely on is beneficial, your good friends can help you.

This is about “*maintaining a simple lifestyle and teaching your children with righteousness*.” When educating children, it’s necessary to have the right method. “Righteousness” means correctness. Just as we discussed earlier, if you get the goal of educating your child wrong, how can you raise a sage or a worthy person? If they’re being guided from a young age with utilitarian thinking, they’ll never become a sage or a noble person. To educate your children well, we as parents must first educate ourselves. It’s about “*teaching children, by first teaching ourselves*.”

Ask ourselves, is our current worldview correct? Parents, if you want your children to live the same life you have, is that good? Why are you thinking so long? Is that such a difficult question? Are you happy in your lives? You’re not. What is the reason for that unhappiness? Your thoughts. Thoughts determine actions, actions determine habits, habits form character, and character determines fate. Therefore, thoughts are the foundation of a person’s destiny. If we don't feel happy with our lives, then by using your same thought patterns to guide your children, how can they possibly be happy? So, the first thing to do is to educate ourselves. Let go of incorrect ideas and quickly instill the right ones into your heart. The urgent thing now isn’t for our children to quickly learn something; it’s for us to quickly learn the right things first. If you have correct ideas and beliefs, you will have correct actions. Then you can provide a proper example through your actions. If you provide the wrong example, how can you teach by your actions?

For example, there's a movie called "Cell Phone." It said adults on average lie twenty-some times a day. We heard a student say that his father was at home, and his mother answered a phone call. When the person asked for her husband, she said he was not home. The child then said, "But Dad is here! Why did Mom say he wasn't?". They were not at all sensitive to the impact of their actions. People should not tell lies. If children see this from a young age, they'll think lying is normal, and that's wrong. You won't be able to raise a Sima Guang (a famous upright historical figure) that way. Sima Guang was the man he became because his father understood education. "Teaching children with righteousness."  When Sima Guang and his older sister were having a hard time peeling walnuts, his sister left for a moment. A servant came over and told him to soak the walnuts in hot water, and it would become easy. When his sister returned, she asked him, “How did you get so good at it?” He replied that he thought of it himself.  That was the first time he lied in his life. His father, who was nearby, noticed it and reprimanded him.  From then on, he never dared to lie and became a person of complete integrity.  “Throughout my life, nothing I have done cannot be shared with others.” This is how his father helped him.  “Teaching children with righteousness.”

Therefore, to truly embody this, we must start with self-education. As parents, are my thoughts every day correct? Thoughts affect children. Next, are my words and actions correct? When we are this vigilant about ourselves, little by little, our words and actions will become an example for our children. Because our principles are very clear, we can guide our children at every opportunity and our verbal teaching will be effective. So, as parents, we must be courageous and diligent and strive to improve our wisdom. The sooner we gain wisdom, the sooner our children will benefit from it.

Emperor Taizong of Tang was very wise. When he saw his child eating, he asked, "Do you know about the rice?" His child said, "No." He used the meal to teach him, “Each grain of rice, think of how difficult it was to obtain.” “The farmer hoes on the day of noon…” Later, when his child was riding a horse, he asked, "Do you know about the horse?" When they were on a boat he asked, "Do you know about the boat?" When he saw a tree he asked, “Do you know about the tree?”  See, how many principles about life he was teaching his child on just one outing? When we take our kids out, we don’t say a word, and then when we get back we just say “Ah, I’m so tired.”

Emperor Taizong seized every opportunity to teach his children, “teaching children with righteousness.” We'll discuss this further next time. Our time is up. Thank you everyone!

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**Lecture 7: Leading by Example, Teaching Through Words, and Cultivating Environments: Nurturing Healthy Growth in Children**

Esteemed elders and friends, hello everyone! In our previous discussion of the *Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management*, we reached the line:

[Teach your children according to righteousness.]

This means that when educating children, we must employ correct methods and impart correct values. The education of children is of utmost importance to a family and a clan; it is also of paramount importance to a nation. When every family has good offspring, the family prospers. And when every family has good descendants, this becomes the bedrock of a harmonious society.  If each family flourishes, the society and nation will naturally be stable. Therefore, parents who successfully raise well-behaved children are making a significant contribution to society.

In the past, when people entered into marriage, the groom would first make offerings to heaven and earth before going to meet his bride. This represented the significance of the event for all of society. Only with good descendants can society have a future. Thus, marriage is not just a matter of whether two individuals are happy. Marriage is about taking responsibility for the nation, society, and one's own family lineage. Therefore, marriage should be approached with great solemnity, understanding it as a responsibility to both carry on the past and open up the future. We should have a correct understanding of, and a correct attitude toward, marriage. Nowadays, this sense of responsibility is often lacking. People get married when they are happy and divorce when they are not, which is entirely unacceptable. As a result, we are seeing many outrageous incidents, even cases where couples marry in the morning and divorce in the afternoon. They are treating marriage like a game, which is extremely inappropriate.

Our Chinese culture, over thousands of years, has always valued propriety, and among the various forms of propriety, the wedding ceremony was of utmost importance and significance. The entire process was designed to instill a sense of mission in the participants, so they would not treat it as a trivial matter. The groom began by making offerings to heaven and earth. Then, the father would represent the ancestors by offering his son a cup of wine. This was a unique moment in the child’s life; usually he respected his father and poured and offered him wine, but on that day, it was the father who poured and offered wine to his son. This symbolized the family lineage being entrusted to him.  I imagine we all grew up respectfully serving our fathers, but on that day when our fathers served us wine, it would be an unforgettable experience. The entire process was designed to instill a sense of mission and responsibility in all those involved.

When the groom arrived at the bride's home, the bride's parents would place her hand in his, signifying his responsibility to them.  They have raised their daughter so well, and he has to take good care of her. After the bride was brought to the wedding carriage, she would throw a fan out of the window. Have you all done that? No? This important detail should be remembered.  Throwing the fan signifies the bride casting away her princess-like temper and her life of leisure, ready to share weal and woe with her husband. If she still had such a temper and such a focus on luxury, there would be trouble, and the family would be in an uproar.  Each step of the ceremony was symbolic and meant to instill a correct attitude toward marriage. This was excellent education.

Upon reaching the groom’s home, the parents-in-law would stand in the position of guests, while the newly wedded couple would ascend the steps from the position of host. This symbolized that from that day onward, the home was entrusted to them.  After entering the house, the couple would drink a cup of nuptial wine.  The cups were made of bitter gourd halves, and contained sweet wine. This symbolized that by drinking from these cups, the couple was committed to sharing both joy and hardship.  Because the cups were made from the same gourd cut into two halves, they represented oneness— they should not be divided from each other.

Such beautiful propriety has been neglected by several generations. We have not fully understood it, and therefore failed to use it to educate the next generation.  Many modern wedding ceremonies do not follow the spirit of traditional ceremonies; they are a mess, aren’t they? Now, wedding ceremonies often become chaotic, a time for practical jokes. This is an undesirable trend. The more we disrespect it and treat it as a game, the higher the divorce rate will become. But, if we approach it with solemnity and if everyone has the right mindset and attitude before entering marriage, they will not be reckless within the marriage.  Therefore, we must be meticulous in the beginning and educate our children well before they embark on marriage.

In fact, life provides many opportunities for teachable moments. For example, when we see “Teach your children according to righteousness,” we should consider, when does teaching a child begin? It begins with prenatal education. When a child is about to go to university, that is another teachable moment before they enter the gates. When a child is about to enter the workforce, we should teach them the right work ethic. This is another example of being meticulous in the beginning.

For instance, if I am about to go teach at a school, my elders should seize the opportunity to remind me, “You must do this job well.  A teacher is one who imparts the Dao and transmits knowledge…” We must memorize more of these sayings. Otherwise, when our children are about to go teach, we will have nothing to tell them. Our teaching “bank account” must have sufficient “deposits” for when the time comes to make withdrawals.  We must remind them, “Teachers are the engineers of human souls. How can this job be approached carelessly? You receive a salary from the country. If you do not teach well, you will owe a debt to all the taxpayers, which you could not repay even if you were a beast of burden for the rest of your lives.” Is this reasonable? Yes. We must deeply understand principles and deeply believe in cause and effect.

Most importantly, we must tell them a story. There was once a doctor who lacked medical ethics and acted carelessly, leading to the death of his patient. As a result, he fell into the eighteenth level of hell. He was angry and stamped his feet, saying, “I didn’t do it intentionally. Why was I judged so severely?” As he stomped his feet, someone below said, “Brother, stop stamping, the dust is falling on me!” The doctor was shocked. The eighteenth level was the lowest, so what could be below that? He asked, “Brother, I am a doctor and fell into the eighteenth level for my negligence. What did you do that put you on the nineteenth level?” The person below responded, “I was a teacher.”  If you tell your child this story before they begin teaching, it will have a profound impact.

I heard this story from my teachers before I started teaching, and it made me very cautious.  It is very reasonable. Why?  A doctor killing someone is losing one life, and if they do good deeds, they will be reborn as a decent person after eighteen years. However, if we mislead people’s values and they become fathers or mothers, or even become primary school teachers or government officials, then, by misleading their values, they can then mislead countless others.  Therefore, wrongly teaching a philosophical concept can harm many generations and influence numerous people. The karmic consequences of severing a person’s wisdom are very serious.

But, after telling this story, we don’t want to make everyone afraid to be a teacher. If we do our best, then we will have achieved meritorious fulfillment. Being a teacher is wonderful, and Confucius is a good example, is he not? The sage and teacher, Confucius, did his best, “learning without satiety, and teaching without weariness.” His blessings have protected his descendants for 2500 years. That is great merit. His descendants exceed one million people. Think about it, over one million descendants, and not a single one was a prodigal. This shows how thick his virtue was and how strict his family education was.

Now, you think, is being a teacher more difficult now or during Confucius’s time? It is more difficult now. I see many people frowning; you must all be teachers. Let me tell you that afflictions are Bodhi, and crises are opportunities.  Being a teacher is even harder today; and the more difficult, the greater the merit. Therefore, elders and friends, if you encounter major challenges in life, you should pour a cup of tea and toast yourself, saying, “Congratulations, heaven must really think highly of you. Come!”  The greater the trials, the greater your blessings and merit. It is not a bad thing. There are no bad things in life. “Every day is a good day, every moment is a good moment, everyone is a good person, and everything is a good thing.” Your blessings are yours, and no one can take them away. So what is there to fear? But the more atrocious the situation, the more you must be able to tolerate, and so you can "cultivate your field of blessings." You can even embrace an evil person, so your blessings will rise because of them. So what obstruction are they? The obstructions are in our own minds. Our inner tolerance is too small, too harsh, cannot tolerate others, and our temper is too big, that is the real obstruction. If a person doesn't get angry with anyone or anything, then what can obstruct them?

Elders and friends, would you like to stop getting angry starting today? You don’t seem too eager? Yes you do. Every time after getting angry, we regret it. Sometimes old friends become so angry with each other that they never contact each other again. After so many years of friendship, we say a cold-hearted thing that breaks all ties.  Human relationships are rare. “If you can endure one moment of anger, you will avoid one hundred days of worry.” We should not get angry. Especially after you have established a family, if you have a big temper, the atmosphere of your home will be like hell, won’t it? When the elders and parents at home get angry, everyone in the family becomes tense and miserable. Anger is like a ferocious tiger that scares everyone around us. We should not be angry.

Why do we get angry?  Because we think too highly of ourselves. If others don't accommodate our wishes, we get angry. Or, we are too focused on our ego, so we become angry because of shame and embarrassment. Or, we are not feeling well physically, so we easily become angry.  It’s always about putting the “self” first, so it's easy to get angry.  If we put the "self" at the back, if we put down the "self," then we won’t be angry.

I have mentioned before about a couple from Singapore. Sometimes the mother-in-law would wrongfully blame her daughter-in-law and misunderstand her. Instead of explaining, the daughter-in-law would kneel and apologize to her mother-in-law. Her husband thought his wife was being wronged. But the wife said, “I am not being wronged at all, because my mother-in-law is the family treasure.” As they say, "An elderly in the house is like a treasure." We can deeply appreciate the truth of this saying.  My grandparents were with us as we grew up, so we know very well that elders in a home are truly treasures. Elders love their grandchildren, and by witnessing our parents’ filial piety to our grandparents, we naturally learned it ourselves. Filial piety is naturally transmitted. Many families today do not live with their grandparents, making it difficult to inherit filial piety. When filial piety is transmitted, children will have filial piety in their hearts, and therefore they will have blessings.  Therefore, the elders are the greatest field of blessings in a family. Respecting and being filial to the elders will bring great blessings.  So, the wife knew very well that her mother-in-law was a treasure. “When my mother-in-law misunderstands me and gets angry, what if she hurts herself? I must quickly calm her down. So, by kneeling to apologize to her, her anger slowly subsides, and my heart is at peace.”

Perhaps some of our women here think, "Being misunderstood and then having to kneel, that’s unreasonable!  I would never do that."  Actually, who is feeling wronged? The “self” is feeling wronged. It’s because of the “self” that we feel wronged.  But strangely enough, does this wife feel wronged? She doesn’t, her heart is at peace. She knows by doing this, she can calm her mother and prevent her from being hurt. She feels at ease because of this. Therefore, given the same circumstance, we might erupt in fury, but this wife kneeled and apologized because she put down her “self.”  She was focused entirely on what would benefit her mother-in-law.  If her mother-in-law benefited, then she would be happy.

Heaven tells us “to suffer a loss is a blessing.”  Kneeling down and apologizing even when you are not wrong may seem like a loss, but the blessings will be endless.  We can see that after this daughter-in-law kneels to apologize, how does the story continue?  After a few days the mother-in-law discovers she has misunderstood her daughter-in-law.  She has not argued her case and even kneeled to apologize.  Such a virtuous daughter-in-law is extremely rare.  So, the mother-in-law will love her even more.  What does the daughter-in-law become?  She becomes the apple of her mother-in-law's eye, like her own precious daughter. Won't this family become more harmonious? There’s no loss here.  So, this story tells us that if we are always thinking of others, we will not get angry.

After finishing this, will everyone be able to not get angry from today onward?  The ancients have taught us many ways to deal with anger. There are six ways of patience.  “Forceful Patience,” suppress it, hold it down and don’t let it erupt. For example, if you are about to get angry, you can say, “I am going to the washroom.” That’s called forceful patience, suppressing it.  When you really can’t hold it down anymore, it’s good to leave and calm yourself. Forceful patience.

Next is “Forgetting Patience.”  A prime minister's belly can hold a boat. Don’t take things to heart, just forget about them. It’s good to forget things, and if we don’t fill our minds with the faults of others, we can fall asleep in five minutes. In truth, people are always making things hard for themselves. They think about things until they are half dead with anger and must take sleeping pills.  Isn’t that making things hard for themselves?  Forgiving and embracing others allows us to sleep well, eat well, and enjoy great blessings. The ancients told us that we are all self-inflicted, we all look for trouble, we all reap what we sow, we all dig our own graves, and we all deceive ourselves. Okay, I won't continue.  Have you awakened yet? Let’s look at the other side: self-improvement, self-reliance, and blessings from within.  Who decides our happiness and suffering?  We do. These sayings all contain the wisdom of life.

“Reflective Patience,” If people can reflect on themselves, as *Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management* states, “When there is a dispute, how can one know that it is not one’s own fault? We must think about it objectively.” This is very reasonable. If there is a conflict with someone, it is a two-way street. The conflict must have erupted because both sides got angry.  My teachers, if people were scolding him, he never retorted, and after a few words, they would stop. Sometimes, they even beat him. He would just lie down on the ground and let them hit him, and they would stop. There’s a lot of truth to this.

There’s another idiom that tells us the wisdom of life. Chinese language, Chinese idioms, and Chinese writings are the treasures of the world. We must pass them down to our people, and to the world. This idiom is “Of equal understanding.”  Do you know it?  What is “equal understanding?”  It means that people who argue with each other are at the same level, they are equal. If we realize this, we will think, yes, my focus is not good enough, otherwise, I wouldn’t be unable to tolerate other people’s words. My own skills are too lacking.

But could there be a situation where one person is entirely correct and the other person is entirely wrong? Where the person who is wrong also mistreats the person who is entirely right.  Does that mean the person who is in the right will suffer?  Have you seen it?  When two people have a fight or conflict, one of them is completely faultless. Has this happened? Let me tell you, if two people conflict and one is completely faultless, the other must be looking for trouble. But when a faultless person is mistreated, they will become a sage!  Yes, I am being serious. For example, some western philosophers said that they became philosophers because their wives were fierce. Then their wives’ fierceness achieved his virtue, didn’t it?

So, there is no loss in this world.  When a person suffers a loss completely, he will become a sage. Let’s take an example you are all familiar with: Emperor Shun. His parents were so terrible that they wanted to kill him, and his brother was also plotting to harm him.  The relationship between father and son, and between brothers had reached an extreme low, but Emperor Shun did not blame the others. He claimed it was his own fault.  Eventually, he became the Emperor and a sage.  He moved his family, and his protection has extended to generations for thousands of years. Such great virtue, is there any loss? Therefore, Emperor Shun has given us great life lessons, hasn't he? Especially the descendants of Emperor Shun, they should carry on this virtue, and everyone who hears this story should also carry on this virtue, and not listen in vain. Therefore, there is truly no loss in life.

In a past life, the Buddha was known as the Sage of Patience. King Kalinga wanted to cut off his flesh slice by slice, but he did not get angry. Instead, it was through this he achieved his path, and he told this tyrant that after achieving enlightenment, he would help him first. So, the king was actually achieving his patience, and after the Buddha became a true Buddha, his first disciple was Kondanna, who was that same tyrant.  He kept his promise.

Therefore, from now on when people are malicious toward us, we should think, this person is here to help us achieve, to test us. Right? If they are scolding us in a demeaning manner and humiliating us, and we still have that thought, then it means we have not studied *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* thoroughly.  *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says, "When a person is slandered for no fault, their descendants will often suddenly rise." If a person has no fault but is still humiliated, it means others owe him, and heaven will repay him. His descendants will have great fortune. We have seen this in our area. Some parents are very honest, never speak much, and are hard-working farmers. Some people take advantage of them and call them names like “idiots” or “stupid.” They would just smile and not argue. As a result, they gave birth to many successful children. Their parents may not be literate, but their children are all successful. After seeing this saying in *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, we understood: "When a person is slandered for no fault, their descendants will often suddenly rise."  So, why would we get angry if someone is scolding us? When people scold us, we should bow and say “Thank you for bringing blessings to me.” They won’t be able to keep scolding us for long.

Therefore, “reflective patience” means that if two hands clap, there must be friction and conflict. It means that our own virtue is not up to par, or that we have not done our part properly. When people recognize their own shortcomings, their arrogance will go down.  Why is their arrogance so high? It is because they insist that the other person is entirely in the wrong. Therefore, they have such high arrogance. When we know we have shortcomings, we will feel ashamed. This is “reflective patience.”

Next is “Observational Patience.”  When we see that a person's words and actions are terrible, we will feel the fire rising in us.  This is what?  This is called being attached to forms. We are attached to a person’s actions or behavior, or even to the words that the person said. We might remember this for thirty years, tormenting ourselves. Isn’t that just self-inflicted suffering?  Are you still angry and shaking when you remember what someone said ten years ago?  Then you are just torturing yourself.  Let me ask you, where is the thing that was said ten years ago?  Bring it here, let me see it.  It’s a phantom that disappeared in an instant, and you are using it to torment yourself. Moreover, that is a sign of attachment.

What should we observe in “Observational Patience?” The cause and effect.  The cause, when a person behaves terribly, that is the result.  The cause is they are pitiful.  They did not have a proper family education, they didn’t have a good upbringing, their parents didn’t love them enough, and they didn’t have teachers to teach them.  Therefore, a detestable person must have something pitiful about them, as *The Treatise on Action and Response* says, "Have compassion for the unfortunate."

When I was a teacher, I had a student who had been expelled from three schools, and my school was the fourth.  When we hear this, we will think that this child is terrible and is acting in a very extreme manner.  But if we think about the cause of that result, what is it?  When we investigated, we learned that his mother was from Thailand and had disappeared, his father was a drifter and often got into fights. How could this child possibly grow up to be a good person given that upbringing?  When we consider the causes, what we feel about their terrible actions is not anger but pity.  There’s also the effect, if such a person doesn't change, the consequences will be unbearable. So, will you still be angry with them?  We don't even have time to pull them up, so why would we get angry?

Therefore, people must have what?  Foresight and hindsight. For ourselves, we must be able to see our past problems, and what the future holds for us. “You reap what you sow,” "If you want to know the future, you need to look at your present efforts,” "Destiny is created by me, and blessings are asked for by myself.”  This means you have foresight and hindsight.  Also, when we look at other people, we must also see their foresight and hindsight.  If this person commits evil, their future will be very miserable, so we should pity them. We should also see the misfortunes in their past that led to this outcome, so we should not attach to their words or actions and become angry.  Therefore, we should not be attached to forms; attachment to forms makes us foolish.

“Joyful Patience” is about being happy. This person is here to bring me blessings. They are here to give me a test. I will see what my skills are right now. Everyone is here to help me achieve. Be happy.

Finally, there is “Compassionate Patience.”  We should treat everyone with a compassionate heart, so that we will not hold grudges, and we will always be thinking about them. Just like the wife, always thinking about her mother-in-law, she wouldn't be able to get angry.  In fact, in our time, our Chinese people have experienced a great disaster. Why such a big disaster? Because we "do not listen to the wisdom of the elderly, and will regret it.” It has truly been disastrous.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining the original tone as much as possible:

**Translation:**

Truthfully speaking, every family has its own struggles, and the prevailing mindset is quite skewed. Therefore, it is a misfortune that so many people cannot inherit the good traditions and culture of our ancestors. We who have encountered and learned these things first have a responsibility to introduce this valuable ancestral culture to them, and certainly, we shouldn’t hold it against them.

Alright, we were discussing “teaching children with righteous principles.” When educating sons and daughters, we must first educate ourselves. We must put in a great deal of effort into education. Generally, before undertaking any task, one should be well-prepared. As the saying goes, “To do a good job, one must first sharpen one’s tools.” For example, if you’re going to take an exam, shouldn't you review your lessons first? Yes, you should. So, I ask everyone, before becoming a father or mother, did you attend a three-week preparatory course? “Prepare beforehand, and you will succeed.” We must prepare ourselves.

Our ancestors were very thorough in educating children. First of all, when does it start? It begins even before pregnancy.  Grand Master Yin Guang’s teachings on educating children, especially daughters, have been compiled into a book called “The Foundation of Universal Peace.” This book is excellent. Those entering marriage must study it carefully; those already married must also study it. “It’s never too late to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost.” Even if you say, “I’m already in my forties,” then pass it on to your children and your daughters-in-law. This is very important.

“Three essentials for seeking children: First, preserve your health and practice moderation in desire to cultivate prenatal health; second, cultivate proper ethics and accumulate virtue to establish a foundation of blessings; third, provide proper prenatal and early childhood education to avoid drifting with the current.”  Looking at the first point, it says that husbands and wives must "preserve their health and practice moderation in desire." Your physical condition should be well-adjusted so that after conception, the child's foundation will be better. We see many businessmen who have made a lot of money, but they indulge their desires, and in the end, their children's qualities are very poor. That’s because they didn't understand that one must preserve one’s health and practice moderation in desire to cultivate prenatal health.

Second, “cultivate proper ethics and accumulate virtue to establish a foundation of blessings.” Because “A family that accumulates goodness will have an abundance of blessings.” Moreover, the relationships between people, especially family members, are due to fate. The more virtuous a family is, the more likely they will attract good offspring. It is said, “Birds of a feather flock together.” If one is very stingy, they will attract extravagant descendants. Because of stinginess, one accumulates wealth but loses the Way. Because of losing the Way, a spendthrift child will come into the family. Confucius was a sage, and for over 2,500 years, his descendants have not produced a spendthrift. This is due to cause and effect. Therefore, if you truly wish for good descendants, you must seek them through virtue, with sincerity. I’ll teach everyone a method. If you make a vow, saying, “I will have this child promote Chinese culture in the future,” you will have good descendants, because Chinese culture is currently in a critical state. When you make such a vow, there will surely be a good response. However, once you make the vow, you must keep your word. Don't try to obstruct them later, telling them to make more money for you instead. That won’t work. Furthermore, everyone must understand that people who vow to carry on Chinese culture are the sole inheritors of their ancestral lineage. Do they not have blessings? If you make a vow to seek such a child, you won't have to worry about them for life. They will naturally be protected and cared for by their ancestors.

Actually, this second point also tells us that one should not seek outwardly but inwardly. With virtue, one will naturally attract virtuous offspring. If you are a virtuous boss, you will attract virtuous subordinates. “With virtue, one gains people; with people, one gains land; with land, one gains wealth; and with wealth, one gains usefulness.” Many young people looking to get married are hoping to find a good partner. But frankly, can they truly find a good partner? “Dragons mate with dragons, phoenixes with phoenixes; a rat's son will dig holes." Their vision is limited to that level; how can they choose someone good? They can only choose someone of their own caliber. Therefore, the most important thing is to cultivate your own virtue. Your vision and blessings will increase accordingly. That is seeking from the root.

People today are not very sensitive to this fundamental principle. Previously, I mentioned that a very close friend of mine, his son found a rather unsuitable partner. However, this couple had devoted themselves wholeheartedly to promoting Chinese culture and had accumulated considerable virtue.  As a result, that girlfriend broke up with their son. This invisible power is very strong, otherwise their family would have been in trouble. An unsuitable woman entering the family could destroy it. So, don't worry too much; things can change. "A family that accumulates goodness will have an abundance of blessings." If you accumulate enough virtue, you can turn misfortune into good fortune. This is a personal example that I witnessed. I was worried for them since I knew them so well. But later, it was confirmed that the power of invisible merit and blessings is indeed very great. Later, his son found a very wonderful wife, always smiling, very likeable, and delightful to look at, with a very even temperament.

"Third, provide proper prenatal and early childhood education.” Begin teaching from the womb, and what is early childhood? Before the ages of three and five.  “Habits formed early in life become second nature.” “Provide proper prenatal and early childhood education to avoid drifting with the current.” This is something we can personally attest to. Our three children don’t argue with others. It's just not in them. For example, if someone raised their voice, my older sister would tear up. When they saw her tears, they wouldn't continue to yell. We realized that our mother never argued with anyone. If someone raised their voice, she would lower her head, and the other person would be unable to continue scolding. So a mother's behavior has a great impact on her children.

So, from what we have discussed, “prenatal and early childhood education” is most important, and a mother’s influence is key.  During pregnancy, they inherit the mother's righteous energy.  The Zhou dynasty produced the most sages because their prenatal education was excellent. There were three generations of female sages: Tai Jiang, Tai Ren, and Tai Si. Tai Jiang gave birth to Tai Bo, Zhong Yong, and Wang Ji, all of whom were sages; Tai Ren gave birth to King Wen; and finally, Tai Si, King Wen's wife, gave birth to King Wu and the Duke of Zhou.  Generation after generation produced sages. Prenatal education is important. And then in childhood, “At three, one can see eighty years into the future; at seven, one can see their entire life.”

In a family, the two most important matters are, first, educating the next generation: "The most important task is educating children." “There are three forms of unfilial conduct, the greatest of which is to have no descendants.” Having no descendants does not simply mean not having children. It means not having good descendants. If your descendants are not good, it is more pitiful and miserable than not having any. "Good children are enjoyable to have, but bad children are worse than none."  Bad children will ruin the family. "Having no descendants is the greatest unfilial act" means having good descendants.

The two most important responsibilities in a family are: economic responsibility, because the family must have financial support to live; and the other is to educate the next generation well. Thus, "There are differences between men and women, and this is the foundation of marital righteousness.” The ancients were truly insightful about human nature. This "difference" lies in the different responsibilities to the family: a division of labor and mutual gratitude. Yes, a wife thinks, "Without my husband as the sky, how would our family survive?" A husband thinks, "It's my wife who allows me to not worry about the home. She takes care of my parents, educates our children, and performs ancestral rites, all so well that I can be completely at ease.” Be grateful for each other's kindness. So, "There are differences between men and women, and this is the foundation of marital righteousness."

As a result, these days, both spouses go out to work, no longer dividing the labor. Who’s going to educate the next generation? The hired help. In some areas, who does it? Indonesian maids, Filipino maids. The more they teach, the more the money goes where? It goes to the Philippines, right? Yes, how can we neglect such a critical matter? Where’s the wisdom in that?  Then both of them go out to work, and who’s afraid of whom? "You wash the dishes!" "You cook the food!” Couples argue over cooking multiple times.  “You earn money, and so do I! So who’s afraid of who?" They even compare how much each of them earns. How can people be so misguided and distorted? They forget the critical task of educating their children.

Therefore, this era changes too quickly. If we don’t calm down, we’ll be dazzled. We need to consider how we should live our lives. If you ask ten different people, you will get ten different answers. My older sister, for example, insists on raising her own children, and many people object. However, my younger brother supports her, and I am a solid vote in support as well.  If you all calm down and think about it, will two people earning always equate to more money? Will one person earning always equate to less?  A lot of anxiety comes from not understanding principles. If we understand principles, we can be at peace. If we understand that what we need is part of our destiny, then it is unavoidable, and it is not necessary to have more people work to make more money.  Think about it calmly. Thirty or forty years ago, a husband with a modest income provided for who? He provided for six or eight children – that was considered normal. Twelve was considered capable. And that included not just the children and wife but also his parents, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law. Twenty years later, they even bought two houses. Right? They were very frugal and thrifty. One salary allowed them to accumulate a significant amount of savings. Now?  Two people earn money for only one or two children and don’t serve their elders, don’t take care of their sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, and still end up in debt. This phenomenon is widespread now. Has everyone woken up? There are many pseudo-truths these days. Therefore, what our ancestors left us, great wealth comes from heaven, and small wealth comes from diligence and thrift. If a family practices diligence and thrift, it will be able to hold on to its money. It’s not that having many people working will let you hold onto the money. The more people that work now, the more they spend.

Furthermore, there are many things that money can’t buy, right? Yes. Look how many couples who both go out to work end up in family situations that money cannot fix.

Therefore, I am now strongly advocating: Women, go home!  Our ancestors left us a very important word, “*an*” (安 - peace/stability), and a home cannot be without a woman. Don't get too excited. Don't go home today and tell your husband, “I’m not going to work tomorrow. Teacher Cai said so.” Next week, your husband will come here in a rage and I won’t be able to teach my class. Everyone needs to understand that in doing anything, one must proceed gradually and not act rashly. You need to understand your family’s objective circumstances. Right? If you suddenly stop working, and your family has no income, that won’t work. Slowly adjust, slowly communicate with your spouse, and reach a consensus. And then you must say, “With kind words, I would happily do anything.” Say, “Husband, you are the sky of our family.” The more you affirm your husband, the more responsibility he will feel. That’s very important. The more you respect him, the more he will be able to step up to his mission and his responsibilities.

If you can both work and manage the household well, that is great. But frankly speaking, nine out of ten women cannot do it. It is truly like what the "Liao Fan’s Four Lessons" says, “Judge by the overall trend, not by present actions; judge by the long term, not by the immediate situation; judge by the world, not by oneself.” "If women staying home is better, then I will take the lead and do it." That mindset is very admirable.

Alright, let us now place things on the scale of life to see how they measure up. Today, if a mother is at home, taking care of her children’s health from a young age, it will benefit them for their whole lives. Their academic and career success depends on a healthy body. If their health is poor, they will have trouble accomplishing anything. How much money can you exchange for a child's health for their entire life? When health issues arise, money cannot buy it back. It’s not just about the children’s health but also the health of the entire family. How many families spend decades of savings because their family members develop health problems? All their savings go towards medical expenses and they even need to borrow money.  In some rural areas in mainland China, people who suffer from serious illnesses will commit suicide because they are unable to afford the medical bills. Therefore, health is life’s greatest wealth, but if mothers don’t take good care from early childhood, won’t their children's constitutions be weak? Out of ten children today, how many are breastfed? Nowadays they all drink milk. Following natural law, who is milk meant for? That’s right, it’s called milk. Are the nutritional needs of a cow the same as those of a human? No. I’ll stop here, or I will get visits from milk sellers next week. In this era, telling the truth is not easy. Everyone should look into the facts to learn more.

What I’ve talked about so far is about health. Moreover, if the mother is present, the entire family, especially the children, will feel very secure. During our upbringing, as soon as we stepped into the house, "Mom, I'm home! What smells so good?" Red bean soup, lotus seed soup. Our childhoods were filled with our mother's deep love, which built our healthy personalities. We don’t feel a sense of lack in our hearts, “Ah, I’m so pitiful, I'm so miserable, I crave for this or that, I want to possess such and such.”  We don’t have these kinds of thoughts. What do we have?  We think about what we can give to others.  When you are full of love, you don’t feel a lack, you won’t be calculating, you won’t compete for things. People who lack security have an especially strong need for control. They are also very pitiful and miserable. Why do they lack security? They open the door, and there's nobody at home. They carry a key around their necks; they're called latchkey kids. Have you all heard of latchkey kids?  Maybe not so much in Malaysia, because more women in Malaysia stay at home. My research shows Malaysia has the highest percentage of stay-at-home mothers in the global Chinese community.

I remember back in 2007, the Chinese consul in Malaysia participated in the signing of a five-year agreement between the headmaster union and our center. This agreement was for the training of headmasters and teachers in Chinese primary schools in Malaysia. During a ceremony, a traditional rite of apprenticeship was performed, with those headmasters and teachers performing three genuflections and nine prostrations. After seeing this, the consul was due to make a speech and he was so moved that he choked up and couldn’t speak for several minutes. We were also deeply moved at the scene. He was deeply touched by the traditional culture. He said that he had seen these things when he was young, so why did they have to be rejected? Because he also experienced the Cultural Revolution and the turmoil. He was profoundly touched to witness this scene here, overseas, in Malaysia. He then added that he hoped men from China would come to Malaysia to marry wives. This was said by a consul. He might have felt that the feminine virtue of the Chinese women in Malaysia was better. Don’t mind if they come to marry you and take you back. It's all for the good of all mankind!

If a child is a latchkey kid and has no warmth at home, where will they go? To video game arcades, to places of entertainment. They will begin to get corrupted. The people who run video game arcades are also making money that brings them misfortune. These children who are only eight or ten years old are being indulged in these games, isn't that destroying them? "The virtuous person loves wealth, but earns it by the right way."  One should not run such businesses, which are destroying so many families and so many children’s lives. So, without the love and companionship of parents, their personalities become unhealthy. How much money can you use to trade for a child's healthy personality? Do you see now? The things that are lost when the mother is not at home cannot be bought back with money.

Furthermore, if the whole family eats out, how much money will they spend each day? If the mother is home, how much money can be saved on food, clothing, housing, and transportation? Also, eating food cooked by the mother is safe, whereas eating out is loaded with too much sugar, too much salt, and too much oil, right? It will ruin the health.

Moreover, there are more temptations in restaurants and hotels outside of the home. If your husband is not careful, and he falls, what can you do?  How much money can you use to trade for a happy marriage?  There are so many temptations outside. What will you do if you cannot resist? Do you all see that all this is things that cannot be bought back with money? I will not continue on, because there are so many points. If I mention one point, you should understand? (*Audience answers:* “Three others!”)  Right.

So, after analyzing all these things, and then reading our ancestors' teachings, we can see that they were insightful into human nature.  They understood that "There are differences between men and women, and this is the foundation of marital righteousness," mutual gratitude. "With marital righteousness comes filial affection." If couples compare how much they earn, blaming each other without affection, will the children be close to their parents? When couples appreciate each other, children naturally feel that their parents are loving, and they will naturally have good relationships with their parents. Right? "With marital righteousness comes filial affection, and with filial affection comes rightness in the relationship between the ruler and the minister.” If one is not filial to their parents, will they respect their leaders in society? I don’t believe that. "Those who love others but not their relatives are called immoral, and those who respect others but not their relatives are called impolite." It is not normal to love and respect others while not loving and respecting one's own parents.

Did you notice that "the relationship between the ruler and the minister" refers to the relationship between leaders and those they lead? The stability of the nation and the stability of the organization are related to "differences between men and women." If our ancestors hadn't explained it to us, how would we realize that the division of labor between couples is related to world peace? It truly is! Yes, so now that we understand these principles, we won't blindly follow others and drift with the current.

Truthfully speaking, for thousands of years, our civilization has produced sages, and families were happy and harmonious. Not to mention the far past, even just fifty years ago families were quite happy and harmonious. My parents' generation, their siblings had good relationships. Why aren't things like that now?  Fifty years ago, things were very stable. And it was even more so when culture was being passed down. Yet now, families are unstable. We must think about this. Professor Toynbee said that to solve the social problems of the 21st century, the only solutions are Confucianism and Mahayana Buddhism. Therefore, teaching children requires the correct views, attitudes, and a consensus between husband and wife.

And educating children can be divided into three main aspects: personal example, verbal instruction, and environmental influence. Lead by example (personal example).  The character for “teach” (教) in ancient writing was written like this: two crosses on the left and a child below. The first cross is the parents and elders; children, through their strong power of imitation, learn by example. So the left part represents personal example, leading by example. On the right side is a hand holding a twig, teaching patiently and tirelessly. If parents and elders are always emotional when they speak, they cannot teach children. They need to be patient and tireless. As for personal example, one must remind oneself to always present a good influence in front of the children. This is a sense of responsibility.

We had an elder whose impression of his father was that his father always got up in the morning to greet his grandmother, then bring water for her to wash her face. Then after she finished, he would take her chamber pot to clean. He did this every day, and the children admired his father greatly. Moreover, since his grandmother was very particular about cleanliness, the father cleaned the pot with great care. Every time after cleaning it, he would perform a check by smelling it to make sure there was no smell at all, before bringing it back. So, his father's action of smelling the chamber pot was imprinted in their memories, and filial piety was passed down. We saw a program on "Filial Children," where director Zhai Junjie, a senior in his sixties, was very filial. He wore reading glasses and cut his mother’s toenails. That picture was very moving. As a result, one day, naturally, his son said, "Dad, let me do it.” His son spontaneously offered to cut his grandmother’s toenails. That was passed on through his observation of his father’s personal example. That is personal example.

Second, verbal instruction. Verbal instruction is about seizing the opportunity to teach the child. Because he is currently involved in that situation, when you remind him, he will never forget it. If you don't seize the opportunity, and you keep preaching at him, he will find it annoying.

I mentioned previously about Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty. In the eighteenth year of the Zhenguan reign, there is such a record. One day, while having dinner with his son, the Crown Prince, he asked his son: "Do you know about rice?" His son said he didn't know. Taizong then said that rice comes from the hard work of farmers.  We often recite, “Weeding the fields under the midday sun, sweat falls to the earth below. Who knows that each grain on the plate, is the result of bitter toil and slow?” And he also told his son that the farmers till the soil in the spring, grow in the summer, harvest in the autumn, and store in the winter. So during the time they are tilling the soil, you must not order them to perform military service, or they won't be able to cultivate. Many bad rulers, for their own pleasure, would deprive farmers during planting time. Eventually there would be no food for the people, and they could not survive. Therefore, one must not take away the time that farmers need to cultivate the land, the seasons of cultivation.

This translation aims to capture both the literal meaning and the nuances of the original Chinese text. I have tried to maintain a natural flow in English while staying true to the speaker’s intent and tone. Please let me know if you have any further questions or would like any specific parts elaborated upon.


Okay, here's a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a natural and professional English rendition:

**It's very important that, nowadays, if you ask a child, "Do you know how rice comes about?" they'll say, "It comes from the kitchen." Then, if you ask, "Where does the rice in the kitchen come from?" they'll say, "From the supermarket." They haven't even seen a farm. Children today are pitiful; they have little contact with nature. Children who interact with nature are innocent, and they are healthier both physically and mentally. Being confined in the urban jungle from a young age, their minds can't be broad. So, sometimes parents say to their children, "Your lives are better than mine. Do you know that your father used to have to climb two mountains to get to school?" The son replies, "Dad, you were more blessed! You could see the mountains and water. When we walk down the street, there are several video game stores, and we are so tempted and in so much pain.” Everyone, think about it, who has more blessings? Thirty years ago, the food tasted completely natural. Now, the fruits are all grown with hormones; they look good, but they don’t taste like much, and they are full of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. So, who is truly blessed? We need to think about this calmly.

Continuing with the story of Emperor Taizong, he had just gone outside and was sitting on his horse. Taizong asked his son, “Do you understand horses?” His son said he did not. Taizong said, “Horses serve people, but you also need to take care of them. You can’t deplete their energy. After using them for a while, you need to let them rest fully. There must be a balance between work and rest. If you use a horse too harshly, and exhaust it, it will run away." This is an attitude toward horses; it can also be extended to how you treat people—you must put yourself in their shoes. You cannot exploit others.

Then, they rode a boat. Taizong asked his son, “Do you understand boats?” His son said he did not. A boat is like a ruler, and water is like the people. "Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it." You are now the crown prince; you must understand this principle. If you love the people, they will support you. If you harm the people, they will not support you.

As they were walking, they saw a tree. Taizong asked his son, “Do you understand trees?” The son said, no. “This tree, if it is measured with lines, can be cut into straight timber. A ruler, as long as he accepts the advice of his subordinates, can become a sage king.” Seeing a tree, he taught his child that you must accept the advice of those below you; "accepting advice makes one a sage.” One can become a wise king, a sage. "Teaching children must be done with righteousness." Through many opportunities, we can guide our children well.

You see, Emperor Taizong was guiding his son about everything he saw along the way. Wouldn't it be great to be such a parent? If we could accumulate such knowledge and wisdom that we can effortlessly use any situation to teach our children principles of life, then our children will become our fans. They won’t have to look for pop stars. They will be fans of their parents. They will admire you. You will be wise, articulate, and resourceful. If you have such expectations, start practicing every day. Share two stories of virtue with your children every day. Your skills will slowly accumulate. Some may say, "But I don't know how to tell stories." Just read them aloud; "where there's a will, there's a way." You will slowly accumulate knowledge.

Third, is the influence of the environment. The impact of the family environment and the community environment. Mencius' mother understood this, so she moved three times. For a positive influence of the environment, first, the governance of the home must be strict. For a family to prosper, it must start with a strict upbringing and strict household rules. Only then will children have a sense of discipline. Without rules, there can be no order. This is very important. When we were young, we were most afraid of our father. Our father was the standard of right and wrong. In our growth process, when people offered us something, what would we do? We would first look at our parents’ faces. That discipline came from the standards of our parents. So, you have to be strict and not let your children be unruly. Don't wait for them to do something wrong; even if there's a slight sign of something, a simple cough from our father was enough to make us behave.

Second, when the whole teachings of the classics are fully implemented within our family, it becomes the power of the environment. There was a lady who was a descendant of Confucius. She had never read *Di Zi Gui* (*Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*) before, but when she read it for the first time, it felt very familiar. She said that every sentence reminded her of situations in her childhood, like, "When elders are standing, the young should not sit"; "Place hats and clothes in a designated spot"; “Older siblings must be friendly and younger siblings must be respectful." Every sentence brought to mind her family’s atmosphere and circumstances. This indicates that although it was her first time reading *Di Zi Gui*, did she actually learn *Di Zi Gui*? Yes, she did. The teachings were already implemented throughout her family. This is the great power of the environment.

Furthermore, it is only through reading that one gains wisdom. So, it's essential to have a good environment for reading and learning at home. This should start from parents enjoying reading the books of sages and classics. "Although descendants may be foolish, they must read the classics; though ancestors are far away, sacrifices must be sincere." Knowing gratitude and repaying kindness must be the family tradition. This entire atmosphere depends on parents and elders to lead the way.

Okay, "Teaching children must be done with righteousness." Let's share with everyone based on these methods of modeling behavior, verbal teaching, and the influence of the environment. That concludes today’s lesson. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here's a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, suitable for a translated book. I've tried to maintain the tone and nuance of the original:

**Lecture 8: Seeing Through the Truth About Wealth**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! In our previous discussion of the *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Family Governance*, the key phrase we examined was:

[**"Teach your children with proper principles."**]

For a family to prosper, it must have good descendants. As the saying goes, "There are three unfilial acts, the greatest of which is to have no posterity," and the most important meaning of "no posterity" is to have virtuous descendants. If they are degenerate offspring, they will truly torment their parents. Not only does a family need good descendants, but the groups and organizations we belong to also need talented individuals to thrive. Therefore, recommending and nurturing talent for a group is an act of loyalty to that group and the nation, and such good deeds are greatly meritorious because they are for the greater good.

In history, Bao Shuya's recommendation of Guan Zhong was recommending talent to govern the State of Qi. Because of this one act, Bao Shuya's descendants held prominent positions for over a dozen generations, and their family fortune flourished for that long. Let us calmly consider how long our families can now prosper? The saying "Wealth does not pass three generations" must be revised. Wealth today often does not even last one generation. However, in ancient history, so many families prospered for hundreds or thousands of years. What is the wisdom and the truth behind this? As parents and elders, we must know. As the saying goes, "A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings in abundance." A loyal person has a magnanimous heart, and they are "cultivating the field of blessings". Conversely, a person with a narrow mind who is jealous of talent is bringing misfortune upon their descendants. "A family that accumulates evil will surely have calamities in store." We see in history that those who were jealous and framed others, what was the end result? They were left without descendants.

Therefore, educating children requires correct wisdom and proper methods. In the *Analects*, there is a saying: "The noble person is devoted to the fundamentals; once the fundamentals are established, the path will follow." When educating our children, we should always teach them the fundamental principles of being a person and doing things, not just the superficial details. It is said, “When the main rope of a net is lifted, all the meshes open.” Now, if I were to ask you all to write down the ten most important principles of being a person and doing things, could you do it? Summarize them. Only when we are very clear about these major fundamental principles of conduct can we educate our children well through our own actions and words. Without grasping the fundamentals, it is, as the saying goes, "putting the cart before the horse."

I would like to ask everyone, which generation of Chinese people over the past five thousand years has spent the most time teaching their children? It’s this generation, isn't it? Then, may I ask, which generation has produced the worst results? There is no proportion here! What is the key issue? We are putting the cart before the horse; we are being too eager for quick results, neglecting the fundamentals. If we don't grasp the fundamentals, our children will be like water without a source, a tree without roots. They are trees without roots, and they could fall at any time. May I ask everyone, when your children go to university and enter society, are you confident that they will not be corrupted by society? *Thunder clap*. This means that this is a serious matter, and we must treat it with caution. It is a wake-up call. Hard work may produce results, but not necessarily good results. If we don’t grasp the fundamentals, then all that hard work is in vain.

In Taiwan, where we grew up, almost everyone memorized the "Twelve Principles for Youth," which are the fundamental principles of being a person. I would like to share these with you. So, this "proper principles," the correct methods, and correct educational philosophy must be rooted in the fundamentals. What are the fundamentals? "Filial piety is the foundation of managing a family well; loyalty and courage are the foundation of loving one's country." To see if a child will be loyal to an organization and the nation when they enter society, just look at whether they have a spirit of loyalty and courage. Loyalty means doing everything carefully and with your best effort. If a child is doing everything half-heartedly, they will only cause trouble for others. Where does courage first manifest? "Knowing shame is akin to courage." This means having the courage to correct mistakes and a sense of shame. It also means having the courage to take responsibility, the courage to learn, and the courage to improve oneself. This is very important. These must be cultivated through parental training to give children more opportunities to refine themselves. When they are timid, encourage them, build their confidence, and develop their courage.

"Trustworthiness is the foundation of building a career." To truly achieve success in a career, these two words are key. No matter what industry, a person will find joy in serving others and taking care of others in their field with a sense of integrity. Trust is humanity's second life. Without it, one cannot stand in society. "Without trust, one cannot be established." So for children, building trust starts with what? Not lying and not speaking falsely. To teach children not to speak falsely, who must first avoid speaking falsely? How can you teach children not to speak falsely if parents do not speak the truth?

“Propriety and etiquette are the foundation of managing affairs.” Look at a child who can receive guests in an orderly manner, showing proper respect to their elders and addressing them as "Uncle" and "Auntie" respectfully. As the saying goes, "When speaking words, speak clearly and calmly, do not be hurried or indistinct." They carry themselves with composure. They do not cower in front of elders. When handling matters, they are not hasty. In managing their interpersonal relationships with others, they know how to act appropriately. Then in the future, when they handle affairs, they will be particularly clear on both human relations and principles. If children lack this training, they will only think of themselves, not others, and they will not know how others feel. Therefore, when they handle matters, they will likely offend many people.

In the past few years, we've encountered many young people in their twenties, and this phenomenon is very serious. They are insensitive to human relations and principles. You can't feel comfortable giving them responsibilities. They do not know how to be considerate, respectful, or assist parents or leaders in managing their interpersonal relationships. Because we must respect those in higher positions, elders, those involved, those in charge, there are rules for everything. If a person hasn’t learned these proprieties, they can’t even adopt an attitude of following the rules in an organization. For example, after a day of learning, they don’t wake up early in the morning; they are late to class; when doing things, such as listening to a lecture, they only think of themselves, and they immediately get up to go to the bathroom, without respecting the lecturer. At night, when the lights are out, they are still talking, disturbing others. Therefore, without knowing propriety, they won’t be able to handle responsibilities, and they will be annoying to everyone. They lack judgment, and they don’t think of others.

So, for those who uphold propriety, propriety is the most beautiful distance between people. They know how to be considerate and helpful, instead of thinking only of themselves. Your children are still young now. You must teach them propriety. You must teach them to be helpful and considerate in every situation. Otherwise, if they want to become talented individuals, it will be very difficult. I heard of a father who went to a company to find the boss, because his son had a bad temper and didn't follow the rules. He said to the boss, "Boss, I didn't raise my son well, that's just how he is, please be more understanding.” Dear elders and friends, if you were the boss, wouldn't you feel helpless? I'm hiring people to do work, not to run a daycare. I am not running a place to take in a bunch of immature children to teach them how to be a person. It is the responsibility of the family and the school to teach them how to be a person. Once they enter society, they should focus on serving others well within their job responsibilities.

"Kindness is the foundation of interacting with others, and peace is the foundation of navigating the world." These are six principles. Then, "Obedience is the foundation of responsibility.” A person who doesn't understand obedience cannot even be a good subordinate. How can they become a leader in the future? So, obedience is the foundation of responsibility. These moral behaviors for navigating the world cannot be separated from the *Standards for Students*. Which phrases in the *Standards for Students* correspond to "Obedience is the foundation of responsibility"? "When parents call, answer immediately; when parents command, do not be lazy"; "Provide for what parents like and desire." "Obedience is the foundation of responsibility" is an attitude to have as a person.

And in order to improve oneself, "Learning is the foundation for helping the world.” One must also have a correct life attitude: "Helping others is the foundation of happiness," not pursuing fame and desire. And to take care of oneself, "Cleanliness is the foundation of physical health." If you are not clean and the home environment is a mess, your health will suffer. Cleanliness is the foundation of physical health. "Perseverance is the foundation of success.” Whether one is exercising, pursuing moral knowledge, as the saying goes, "Studying is like rowing upstream; if you don’t advance, you will retreat," one must have perseverance. This perseverance applies to maintaining one's health, learning, and in doing things. "Nothing is difficult in the world for the person who has the will." To achieve something is not easy. "One who travels a hundred *li* is half-way at ninety." In life, many things might only be a hundred steps from the goal, but most people give up halfway or just before reaching it. Therefore, perseverance is the foundation of success. And one last principle: “Diligence and frugality are the foundation of service.” One must be diligent and frugal to serve others. No matter the industry, one will not succeed if they are lazy. If one is not frugal, they waste water, electricity, and supplies in an organization. How can they possibly do a good job? The organization and family may end up losing a lot of money because of them. So, "Diligence and frugality are the foundation of service." These are the "Twelve Principles for Youth."

When you grasp these virtues, the principles of how to be a person and do things, honestly speaking, each principle is very broad and deep. You can learn more about them yourselves. See how to implement these fundamentals in your own families. Using your actions and your words, you can guide your children by telling stories, for instance about historical figures who had perseverance and achieved great things; or figures who were very knowledgeable. Instead of letting them be fans of pop stars, they should be fans of their own parents.

Let us look at the next sentence:

[**"Do not covet unexpected wealth."**]

When we see this word "wealth," it is impossible for a person not to accumulate wealth in this life, because we need it for our own living and for our families to have economic security. But there is an important saying: "A noble person loves wealth but acquires it in a proper manner." So, how does wealth actually come about? Can one earn a lot of money just by working hard? We are all adults, and we must think clearly about this question. Working hard to earn money and which industry to work in are all about "conditions." If a person has those conditions, that is a “condition”. Someone might ask, "If a person is destined for wealth, but they are lazy and love to eat, can they earn money?” No, they have the "cause," but they do not have the "conditions." Therefore they cannot produce a result. What is the cause? Alms-giving and charity lead to wealth. If a person can accumulate merits, then they will have the true cause of wealth. Many people work very hard, and are very well-educated, but they cannot earn money because they do not have wealth in their destiny. So if we do not understand this point, many people will complain in life. "So-and-so's ability is not as good as mine, their education is not as good as mine, but their career is better than mine.” They will be so angry that they will get sick and even cancer, which is troublesome. If you want to encounter good conditions, you must first sow the cause. What cause should you sow? Build good relationships with others and you will encounter many good conditions, and helpful people in your life. So in nature, everything operates in accordance with the natural order of cause, condition, and effect.

There is a person in history who can best prove how to acquire wealth, and he is known as the "God of Wealth": Tao Zhu Gong. He was from the State of Yue during the Spring and Autumn Period. Tao Zhu Gong, whose name was Fan Li, was the greatest contributor to King Goujian’s restoration of his state. He was very insightful about people. He knew that Goujian could share adversity, but not wealth. So he left with his wife, Xi Shi, changed his name, and became a merchant.

Have you noticed that he could be a minister, but he could also be a very successful businessman? This is the real benefit of learning traditional culture. The *Analects* says, "The noble person is not a tool.” When a noble person learns the fundamental principles of being a person, their usefulness to society is not limited. Think about it: did Zeng Guofan learn martial arts? He was primarily a scholar. He was very knowledgeable, and he was not born into a military family. But he put down the Taiping Rebellion. So his learning was not limited. You can have him play any role, and he will play it well.

Therefore, all the fundamental principles of how to be a person and do things are all interconnected. Even a person who is good at cooking, if they understand the principles of cooking, can become a prime minister. But one has to have that understanding. Lao Tzu said, "Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish." Think about it. Does a wife who keeps the kitchen tidy and clean have a skill? In the past, women were in charge of cooking for dozens or hundreds of people, and they had to distribute the work properly, just like managing an army. They had to be precise in controlling the heat. Their hearts were very keen and meticulous.

Soon after Tao Zhu Gong became a merchant, he became very wealthy. Then he donated all his wealth to charity. He started a small business again, and he became very wealthy again. Then he donated all his wealth to charity again. History records that he “accumulated wealth three times, and distributed it three times,” and that is why he was known as the God of Wealth. Because he understood the true cause of creating wealth is to give charity.

Why do we say that "The cycle of fortune turns every ten years?” Because wealthy people don't understand this principle, they will decline. Why? They become misers and hoard wealth, losing their sense of right and wrong. They don't help their relatives and friends, clutching their money, which damages their sense of righteousness and their blessings. Therefore, a very stingy person will have a prodigal son who will spend all the money. Human calculations are not as good as Heaven's calculations. Thinking that everything is mine, that's not how it works.

The scriptures say, "Wealth is shared by five households." People all think “it’s my money,” and they hold on to it tightly. But what is money? Wealth is currency. Currency must circulate. "Where there is water, there is wealth." Right? In *feng shui*, good *feng shui* means there is a river in front, or a crescent lake, and a green dragon on the left and white tiger on the right. Of course, if you only live in good *feng shui*, but your heart is bad, then there may be thunder and rain in three days, and the mountain will collapse, and the dragon's lair will become a mouse's hole. *Feng shui* changes. So foolish people focus on the appearance, and wise people focus on what? The fundamentals. Lin Zexu said, "If the intention is not good, *feng shui* will be of no benefit." No matter how good your home’s *feng shui* is, if your intention is not good, then the *feng shui* will soon be ruined. Our ancestors told us that money is meant to circulate, just like water. Water that does not flow becomes stagnant and smelly. So, making money depends on opportunity, and spending money depends on wisdom. If you spend money well, you will accumulate great blessings for yourself and your descendants.

In the past few years, Teacher Hu Xiaolin and others have printed millions of copies of traditional cultural classics, and countless families have benefited. That’s a great way to spend money. Spending money on what? On the ethical principles that are most needed in society. Therefore, people who know how to spend money are using their wealth to accumulate good deeds and virtue, thereby constantly improving their own wisdom and moral character. Those who are unkind use their lives to acquire wealth. Their life is a pursuit to constantly earn money, but their kindness has degenerated. Many people in the business world today earn a lot of money; it's in their destiny. But they don't take care of their employees. Many employees in their 30s or 40s are worked to death. That shows a lack of kindness, and not caring for their subordinates. This type of business will soon fail. Such people use their lives to acquire wealth; those who are kind use their wealth to cultivate their lives. Spending money should increase your virtues.

We just talked about "Wealth is shared by five households." Generally speaking, people do not believe this. They think, "It's my money!" So, who are the five households? Floods, fires, thieves and robbers, corrupt officials, and finally, unfilial descendants. These can all cause our wealth to be drastically reduced. Many people, after becoming wealthy, build extravagant homes. It's as if they are saying, "Thieves, please feel free to visit my home." So we should conceal our wealth and teach our children well. If they flaunt their wealth and children are raised extravagantly from a young age, if the children think “my family is rich, my dad’s money is enough for me to spend for several lifetimes,” then no amount of money will ever be enough. If they become addicted to gambling, they can lose all their money overnight. Do you all see from this last type, the “unfilial descendants”, the importance of educating the next generation?

If you want to keep your wealth, it definitely has something to do with whether you have fulfilled your sense of duty and righteousness. Righteousness and profit cannot be separated. If one pursues profit without regard for righteousness, it’s like "licking honey off the blade." This phrase is very telling. There’s honey on the blade. You see the honey, and you can’t resist going to lick it. Is it tasty? You lick it, it's so sweet! What’s this bleeding? You just cut your tongue off. We must understand that we shouldn't focus only on immediate profit. Because humanity is too eager for quick results, it has forgotten the education of the next generation. Without talented people in the next generation, humanity will not have a future! What is the meaning of this kind of profit?

Therefore, the first hexagram in the *Book of Changes*, the Qian hexagram, mentions that "Profit is the harmony of righteousness. Benefiting others is sufficient for harmonizing with righteousness." What is true profit? The “righteousness” here means appropriate, proper. It means that all of the actions should be done appropriately. As they say, “A noble person loves wealth, but acquires it in a proper way.” When everything is done appropriately, then we can truly receive benefits. And where do the benefits come from? They come from benefiting all things. Benefits that align with morality and righteousness are true benefits.

Let's think calmly. Has humanity’s invention of pesticides benefited anything? No. They are only for their own immediate convenience. When insects come, they just kill them. This is not aligned with righteousness. How can we harm so many lives? Has humanity benefited? No. After spraying pesticides, the land becomes hardened and infertile, and the land cannot be used for planting vegetables. Then what? "What you send out, you will receive back." Of all animals, who drinks the most pesticides? Would you say humans are intelligent? They are short-sighted and only focused on immediate profit!

And where is the tragedy today? The tragedy is that those who grow vegetables dare not eat their own vegetables, and those who grow rice dare not eat their own rice. People in every industry tell their families not to consume those products. For example, people who make soda, do you think they drink soda at home? Honestly speaking, orange soda, apple soda, where are the oranges? Where are the apples? They are all lies! Because they haven’t learned the “Twelve Principles for Youth”, that is, "Trustworthiness is the foundation of building a career." You need to understand, how is orange soda made? It's a chemical substance extracted from petroleum. It tastes similar to oranges. I even made it for my children, using baking soda and phenol. Who would dare to drink that? So, it's very tragic.

People who pursue wealth through immoral means are bringing misfortune upon themselves and their descendants. "Acquiring wealth unrighteously is like using rotten meat to relieve hunger or drinking poisoned wine to quench thirst." The *Treatise on Actions and Retributions* by Lao Tzu says very clearly, “Acquiring wealth unrighteously,” which is what we are discussing here, “unexpected wealth,” which shouldn’t be yours to begin with, yet you still pursue it. "Rotten meat" is putting meat under the eaves, where it is rained on and soaks overnight and turns poisonous. "Poisoned wine" refers to the poison from a bird called a “zhen” (鴆). Its feathers are soaked in wine to create a highly toxic drink. These ancient analogies are meant to wake us up. People who seek unrighteous wealth are like eating rotten meat to relieve hunger; it seems like they are full, but they soon die. They are like drinking poisoned wine to quench their thirst. When they drink the wine, they die. So, this kind of wealth is difficult to maintain.

There are a few examples in history. In Shaoxing Prefecture, there was an administrator in charge of finances whose position was not insignificant. He was extremely greedy and accumulated hundreds of thousands in wealth. Later, he resigned his position and bought thousands of acres of farmland. Thousands of acres is a lot! In that area he was the richest. His grandfather repeatedly told him in his dreams that if he continued down this path, he would definitely face condemnation from heaven. You see, his grandfather appeared in his dreams several times, which means that this family was actually meant to have good fortune. It’s just that he didn't understand the principles and acquired his wealth through illegal means. Because it was in his destiny to have wealth, even when he used illegal means, he still gained wealth. For example, if it were his destiny to have 10 million, when he acquired it through illegal means, he lost a large amount of it. Maybe he only had 5 million left, and yet he still thought he was doing well. This is called “the petty person, in the wrong way, acts as a petty person”. If he had used proper means, his wealth would have been more than this. So, in the end, the cunning person is misled by his own cleverness.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and readability, while maintaining the tone of a thoughtful, lecture-style delivery:

**Title: The Blessings of Virtue and the Dangers of Greed**

This individual experienced reminders from his ancestors, who bestowed blessings upon his family and were of great virtue, yet he was unfilial and disobedient.

History offers us a very different example, one many of you may be familiar with: "Dou Yanshan had righteous methods, teaching his five sons, all of whom became famous." Dou Yanshan's grandfather also appeared in a dream, telling him, "You must quickly accumulate virtue; your blessings are too thin. You will soon die, and you will have no children." In the end, Dou Yanshan listened, changing his fate. His five sons all achieved great success. So who is the most blessed? It is the person who listens – who listens to their parents, their grandparents, their ancestors, and especially, who listens to the Sages, to the wisdom of five thousand years. When we manage our lives, along with our children, using this five-thousand-year wisdom, our destinies will be completely different from those of ordinary people.

However, this Provincial Administration Commissioner was repeatedly warned by his grandfather, yet he refused to believe it. He had a son and a grandson. Because he was very rich, but this wealth was ill-gotten – “wealth is shared by five families” – unfilial descendants came to ruin it. His son and grandson both indulged their desires, frequenting prostitutes and gambling. Eventually, both died, and he himself contracted a disease that left him paralyzed. Then, his daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law became unchaste, and the family’s reputation was destroyed, plunging it into chaos.

In fact, even choosing a daughter-in-law relies on the blessings of virtue. I remember my mother often telling us that whoever comes to your home for dinner is predestined, so-called karma is destined by Heaven. And what is "Heaven?" It is the natural order. If you have virtue, then the wife you marry will be excellent: "With virtue comes people, with people comes land." So don't rush into matchmaking. It's putting the cart before the horse. You must first have virtue. With virtue comes wisdom, and with virtue, you can attract the right people. Dragons mate with dragons, phoenixes with phoenixes, and a mouse's son knows how to dig a hole. If you lack virtue, if you don't have perceptive eyes, what kind of person will you choose?

The Provincial Administration Commissioner’s family descended into such chaos that, because they still had money, many relatives and friends schemed against them, coming to their home to bully them. He, now paralyzed, could only watch these relatives and friends exploit his family, bringing about its downfall. He witnessed it all unfold. And then, as he was about to die, having reached old age and squandered all his wealth, right before taking his last breath, he suddenly opened his eyes wide and loudly exclaimed, “To have been a Provincial Administration Commissioner is no small thing; to have ten thousand acres of land is no small thing.” These lands, that he had accumulated, were all lost, and that was him too! Then he breathed his last. He spoke the truth at the end, thereby redeeming some of his transgressions. So how many generations does wealth last? Not even one generation in this case! This event happened in Zhejiang province.

There’s another story from a place called Dingyuan. There, a magistrate named Di knew of a wealthy man who had died, leaving his property to his wife. Because the fortune was worth tens of thousands of gold, the wife’s brother-in-law, the deceased man’s brother, had wicked intentions. He went to the magistrate, and the two planned to frame the wife. He told the magistrate, “If you help me win this lawsuit, we’ll split the inheritance.” Magistrate Di agreed. He had the wife arrested and brutally tortured, seizing her money and dividing it in half. The wife died full of resentment.

Later, Magistrate Di returned to his own hometown. One day, while napping in broad daylight, he suddenly saw this woman enter his house. She was holding a small turtle, which she hung over his bed, and then vanished. Soon after, he began to develop painful boils all over his body. The boils were shaped like a turtle, and when pressed, the open wounds would move, the pain reaching down to the bone. He suffered this sickness day and night, wailing constantly, and died within a year. His five sons and seven grandsons all developed the same boils and died one after another. Only one grandson survived, and he had no blessings at all, not even an inch of land to stand on.

Both of these examples concern the seizure of ill-gotten gains. Dishonestly acquired wealth is called windfall, but "windfall gains bring windfall disasters.” Such money must not be taken. Dishonestly earned wealth must not be taken. "Unexpected wealth" includes dishonest wealth. What if one suddenly finds a large sum of money? Can you keep it for yourself? No. Why? Because all wealth has an owner. If this money is very important to someone else, and we take it for ourselves, their family might not survive. Who would they blame for this? Every wrong has a source, every debt has a debtor. Dou Yanshan made a vow to do good deeds, and soon after, he found a bag of silver. He waited for the owner to come and claim it, only later learning that the money was to save the owner’s life. Had he kept it, imagine how much merit he would have lost! Therefore, even unexpected gains must not be taken. We must be able to return what is found, not pocket it.

Ladies, let me ask you, if your husband finds a piece of gold on the road and brings it home, how would you react? “Wow! Great! You’re always finding gold!” That’s the reaction of a woman lacking in wisdom. A wise woman would pick up the gold, throw it far away, and say: “A man should have great ambitions; how can you be greedy for such a small gain?” I’m not just making this up; I have historical examples to back it up. Many scholars who achieved great things had wives who threw away the gold they found, saying: “You must rely on your own abilities!” That’s the right way! If a man who finds gold starts walking around looking down every day, searching, saying, “Is there more gold? Is there more gold?” how can he possibly achieve anything great? Greed would constantly be at play in his heart. So, seeing a small, seemingly fortunate gain is really where fortune and misfortune are intertwined.

Look at Fan Zhongyan. One day, he found a pile of gold, but he remained calm and buried it where it was. He had grand ambitions and eventually became a chancellor. Later, the temple where he had been studying requested donations for construction. He immediately told them that there was a pile of gold under a certain tree which could be used. When they found it, everyone was full of admiration. Faced with so much wealth, when he himself was so poor, he was not moved at all. "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him; poverty and hardship cannot sway him."

Even when invited to feast by a friend who, touched by his diligence, wanted to offer him a lavish meal, he didn't touch it. His friend was upset. "Are you looking down on me? I have offered such generous hospitality.” He sincerely told his friend, "Thank you for your kindness, but if I eat such a sumptuous meal now, how can I return to eating my cold porridge?" You see, his usual meal was a pot of porridge which he let cool and solidify, then cut into four pieces, eating just that every day to save money. “If I eat such a feast, how can I return to eating this?” The friend was deeply moved. You see his ability to control his desires. He had originally told his mother he would return in ten years. But in less than ten years, he had brought honor to his family and was able to bring his mother back.

Greed invites disaster. Look at the Chinese character for "greed"—貪. It looks very similar to another character: 貧—the character for poverty. As soon as someone is greedy, they slowly move towards poverty. But without greed, great blessings will soon manifest. History records the story of "Yang Zhen and the Four Knows." Yang Zhen was a man of the Han Dynasty. Once, Wang Mi, a man he had promoted, passed through the place where Yang Zhen was an official. To express his gratitude, he brought ten pounds of gold as a gift, attempting to offer it at night. Yang Zhen said, "I promoted you because I understood you. How can you not understand me? Why are you offering me gold?" Wang Mi said, "It is night now; nobody can see. I checked carefully when I came in. Rest assured; no one can see.” Yang Zhen replied, “Heaven knows, spirits know, you know, and I know. How can you say that no one knows?” Therefore, his family's ancestral hall is called the “Hall of Four Knows.” Because of his honesty, never accepting bribes, his descendants were greatly blessed, with four generations serving as teachers to the emperor. That’s the extent of the blessings he received! His son Yang Bing, grandson Yang Ci, and great-grandson Yang Biao all served as senior ministers, advisors to the emperor. So the blessings of not being greedy are great; the blessings of integrity are great.

Zhuge Liang was very honest, and his descendants also prospered. Furthermore, Grand Preceptor Yang Gongbo also served as a teacher to the emperor. His father was a merchant in Huaiyang. His business partners and friends greatly admired him. It happened that a salt merchant from Guanzhong urgently needed to return home and entrusted a thousand pieces of gold in his luggage to Yang Gongbo’s father. Because the merchant didn’t return for two years, the father buried the money in a flower pot and planted flowers and plants on top. He then sent people to investigate the situation of the merchant. He discovered that the merchant had passed away, and he had a son who was completely unaware of his father's thousand pieces of gold. He invited the son to his home and took the gold from the flowerpot. The merchant's son was astonished and hesitated to take it. The elder said, “This is yours; why would you refuse it?” The son expressed his gratitude and left. He was a businessman, but he was not greedy for wealth. Later, he had Yang Gongbo, who became Grand Preceptor, and his grandson, Yang Junmin, who served as the Minister of Revenue. These are all examples of not being greedy and receiving wonderful rewards.

Let’s return to what I mentioned before: righteousness and benefit must never be separated. Think about it calmly. Over the past few decades, humanity has created tremendous material wealth, but it has not shown respect for nature or Mother Earth. This is unrighteous. So, have humans truly earned money? Do they truly have wealth? Are they truly living happy lives? This is something worth considering. Our ancestors respected Heaven and Earth, and they were grateful. They had righteousness. The heavens, rivers, and mountains were able to nurture our lives. So, after a good harvest, they sacrificed to heaven, to earth, to the God of Grain, and to the rivers. They knew how to be grateful and repay kindness. There was no destruction, no pollution, and no indiscriminate felling of forests.

Now, many people are saying that even if we take all the money we’ve earned to try and restore the Earth, we cannot. It’s like we haven’t earned enough to cover the damage! So benefit must not be separated from righteousness. Otherwise, a small, selfish gain might destroy you and your descendants. Think about it. What kind of air do our future generations breathe? What kind of water do they drink? What kind of land do they grow on? And now the ozone layer is damaged. The sunlight, air, water, and soil - the most crucial elements of human life - these four are all being harmed. The ultraviolet radiation is too strong. Isn’t all this the disaster brought about by our pursuit of benefit without regard for our duty towards the Earth?

On a large scale, if the entire environment lacks moral principles, then on a smaller scale, the family must also uphold moral principles. What is the most important moral principle in the family? It is filial piety towards parents, taking care of relatives, and educating future generations. Aren't these the moral principles? But what is happening now? Everyone is working hard to make money, ignoring all these things. In many rural areas, husbands and wives are leaving to work, leaving the elderly neglected and the children uneducated. As a result, the family structure in rural areas is not healthy. Children lack the love of their parents, making it difficult for them to grow and develop their character. Also, there are too many violent and sensual movies and television programs in the countryside, and many elderly people and adults are corrupted by these influences. Unable to resist temptation, they may even harm the young, children in their early teens. All of this stems from our neglect of family responsibilities, and these are the various tragedies that are occurring in society today.

So, women should not leave the home. Our ancestors created characters. How do you write “peace” (安)? It is a woman under a roof. Why isn’t “peace” written as a man under a roof? Why did Confucius say, “A wife is the head of the family”? The prosperity of a family and a clan relies primarily on whom? The wife. That's why she’s called a “homemaker.” Marrying a good wife will bring prosperity to three generations, but marrying a bad one leads to ruin.

In truth, few people truly understand the importance of women in the family. People in this era have very limited understanding of ethical principles and family management. When it comes to principles of health and wellness, our traditional Chinese medicine has focused on preventing disease rather than just treating it. In the same vein, when cultivating oneself and managing a family, you should aim to prevent chaos, not simply try to remedy it after it has occurred. But our current era has not carried on five thousand years of wisdom, and when will people start to understand these important principles? For instance, if their body has problems, a doctor might tell them: "Sir, I regret to inform you that you only have six months left, or maybe only three months.” It's only then that they start to say: "Oh! Health is so important!" It’s when it’s hard to salvage the situation that people start to get a sense of its importance.

People today are numb. Why? Desires blind their wisdom, and greed clouds their minds. Everything they consider is about benefit, without considering moral righteousness. So, many couples get divorced, and they do not understand why their other half wants to leave them. The other half is so angry that they cannot accept him anymore, and he still doesn’t know what the problem is. Because, in his eyes, all he sees is money, money, money. It's so troublesome. Only after marital problems arise do they realize that it takes effort to care for one another; only when their child is 13 or 14 and completely disobedient, do they realize that educating children is important. So people lack clear understanding. They are slow to realize, or are even completely numb. No matter how much you speak to them, they won’t understand. Therefore, we have to gather stories, stories with more impact, use bloody examples to have a chance of breaking through.

In Zhuzhou, Hunan province, there was a couple, both university graduates – not a small achievement for someone in their sixties. They quit their jobs to start a factory, hoping to make more money. They didn’t care for their child, but sent him money. They didn't fulfill their duty to educate their next generation. Actually, people are pitiable. Why? Because they don't understand the principles, they believe that if the couple both earn money, they’ll have more money. But if they truly understood these principles, they would know that “if it’s meant to be, you will have it, if it’s not meant to be, don’t force it.” If they really understood the principle of “simply do good deeds; don’t worry about the future,” if they only do good and accumulate virtue, wealth will come naturally. Instead, they saw how much others were making and became jealous, and they just tried to make money with no regard to their family.

So, the first key point of this story is: “understanding brings peace of mind.” If people do not understand that wealth comes from their own cultivated blessings, they become restless when they see that others have money, and they start to desire it. The second key point is that they did not grasp the importance of "nothing is more crucial than educating your children.” They neglected their children, so the children did not receive their parents’ love, leaving them feeling very empty inside. And those who feel empty are more prone to wanting to numb themselves. Do you think children enjoy spending days in video arcades? It is because they lack warmth at home that they want to spend time there.

I moved to Kaohsiung when I was two, and lived in the city. There were so many arcades, but I was never attracted to them, because I loved going home to drink red bean soup, because I felt my parents’ love. During our vacations, my father would drive our old car; it was a car that had been driven for ten years when my father bought it. The back seat was tilted, and we, three siblings, would squeeze in. My older sister was in high school and I was in junior high, and we were all already quite tall, and that was a small 1.3-liter car. I still remember it vividly. The car was small, but we felt a lot of warmth. We understood that our father, to leave us with so many good memories of our childhood, saved every penny to buy that car. It wasn't a great car, but we have sweet memories of it. What I'm telling you is that good memories in life don’t come from spending lots of money, they come from treating people with sincerity, and spending time together.

So this couple, with their high level of education, gave up their jobs to start a factory, and they did not teach their child well. The child became addicted to betting on sports and used their land deed and house deed as collateral. One day, they suddenly received a notice that all their factory and home were being seized to pay their debt. The son ran away to avoid the debt. The couple, on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2011, drank pesticide and committed suicide in front of their family’s ancestral graves. How heartbreaking this was for the ancestors! The greatest regret is that this couple had never studied traditional Chinese culture; otherwise, they would never have ended their lives in this way.

There is an entrepreneur in Taiwan who built a very successful business. During the time that opening a securities company was very profitable, he entered the securities business, but lost 3 billion Taiwan dollars. But he had studied traditional culture. He read classical texts as a child, and he knew that integrity and honesty were important. People urged him, “Run to the United States; you don’t need to pay back this money.” But he said, “I will be the poorest man with the most integrity.” So, he lost 3 billion dollars. But because he upheld integrity, after some time, he had an opportunity in Mainland China, and because he had a good reputation, his friends and relatives all lent him money, and he made a comeback. Now, his business is much more successful than it was in Taiwan.

So, if that couple had understood those principles, they could have strengthened themselves, they could have been determined to learn from their pain, and they wouldn't have had to choose the path of death. You see, people commit tragic acts because they don’t understand many principles in life. And that is why they reach this outcome. This couple’s story is indeed very enlightening. When making money, you must also take care of your family. In this way, wealth will last a long time. That’s why our ancestors were compassionate and in the *I Ching* at the beginning of the *Qian Hexagram* they mentioned that “Benefit is the harmony of righteousness.”

Today, we spoke about the principle of "never be greedy for unexpected wealth." We cannot be greedy; we must uphold our moral principles, and understand that our fate is in our own hands. Our blessings are in our hands. So, people should not live in greed; they should not live in worry. Many of the worries we have come from worrying about the future, worrying whether we will have money or blessings in the future. That is baseless anxiety. People who truly understand the principles know that fate is in their own hands. With true virtue and true wisdom, they not only control their own fate, but they control a good fate for their future generations.

Okay, that's all I'll share with you today. Thank you all.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional, readable style suitable for a book:

**Lecture 9: Kind Hearts, Kind Fortunes**

Respected elders, dear friends, hello! In our course on the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, we last discussed “Do not covet unexpected wealth.” Today, we will continue with the next line:

**【Do not overindulge in wine.】**

We see the word “do not” in this line, which serves as a reminder that we should refrain from certain actions. As we study the teachings of the sages, we must develop discernment and wisdom to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, and benefit from harm. We should know what is beneficial to us and draw near it, learning to manage it well; we must also recognize what is harmful and avoid it entirely, preventing it from becoming a source of trouble. This is knowing what is good and what is bad, what is beneficial and what is harmful. If we can uphold these principles, we are likely to avoid many calamities in life; if not, we may attract them. For instance, regarding coveting unexpected wealth, as we discussed before, acquiring ill-gotten gains inevitably brings disaster. “It is like using rotten meat to alleviate hunger or poisonous wine to quench thirst; while it may temporarily satisfy, death will follow.” Seizing unexpected wealth will undoubtedly lead to misfortune; there is no room for luck.

Similarly, "overindulging in wine," lacking restraint, will lead to a loss of reason. Firstly, it will certainly harm one's health, as many illnesses are a result of excessive drinking. Beyond physical harm, one's entire reputation may be ruined by drunken words or shameful acts, all caused by a single instance of reckless drinking. Furthermore, one’s parents and family will be in constant worry, concerned for their health and safety. Throughout history, many rulers have brought ruin upon their nations due to their love of alcohol.

The ancients, in their compassion, offered numerous warnings regarding the dangers of excessive drinking, hoping we would learn from them. The *Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian Huibian* mentions that when ancient people invited friends and relatives, they drank with moderation. The ancient wine cups had two small posts near the rim. This design served as a reminder: if one drank too much, those posts would poke one's eyes. Hence, one was cautioned not to drink too much, to avoid becoming blind. Thus, the wine cup itself carried an educational purpose, emphasizing that one should not overindulge. Therefore, we must calmly consider that if drinking is without restraint, and one becomes intoxicated, their behavior will be erratic. They may act contrary to proper etiquette, perhaps insult others, or reveal private matters, potentially leading to enmity or even death. The *Huibian* offers numerous examples. However, such actions are all a result of irrationality caused by drunkenness. Some people cannot handle alcohol; they become intoxicated and pass out on the street, especially in cold weather. Many have lost their lives this way, particularly when temperatures drop below freezing. Their families are often left with a lifetime of regret.

Today, we face an even more serious problem: drinking and driving. This not only harms the driver but also endangers the lives of the public. We have heard of instances where drunk drivers cause fatal accidents, leaving many families grief-stricken, all because of a craving for alcohol. Consequently, laws against drunk driving are now extremely stringent.

Beyond not overindulging ourselves, it's best not to drink at all. We should also advise others to drink in moderation. If a gathering involves driving, the driver should absolutely not drink, or they may make a mistake and cause harm, leaving everyone with lifelong regret. This is our duty and responsibility. Even with our younger generations, we should teach them from a young age, "When still young, refrain from wine; when drunk, one is most unsightly." This will cultivate good habits and prevent them from acquiring bad ones. Intoxicated people are irrational; they may break the law or disrespect superiors. Over time, heavy drinking can lead to a decline in morality and ruin one’s reputation. Government officials may be dismissed due to a loss of trust or scandals; farmers may neglect their land; and business owners may go bankrupt. These are potential consequences of alcohol abuse. Furthermore, drinking often intensifies lustful desires. When one is under the influence of alcohol, the body's heat rises, making it difficult to control these urges. When intoxicated, desire increases, and engaging in sexual activity at this time will upset the body’s internal balance, causing illness that is difficult to cure.

The Buddhist text, *Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra*, lists thirty-two potential consequences of drinking, detailing the harm it can cause. Examining these, we can deeply appreciate the compassion of Bodhisattva Nagarjuna. These thirty-two consequences mainly point out how alcohol consumption leads to loss of self-control.

The first point is “**the mind loses all restraint**,” meaning one loses control of their own behavior.

Second, “**wealth is exhausted**.” Many alcoholics end up impoverished because their drinking habit prevents them from working. They spend their days drinking and, in the end, may lose everything they own.

Third, “**the gateway to all diseases**.” Alcohol harms the body, especially the liver, leading to a host of ailments.

“**The root of disputes**” is the fourth point. Intoxication leads to irrationality and conflict, and many homicides are related to alcohol consumption. Drunkenness leads to a volatile temper, which can escalate into violence and become difficult to resolve.

Fifth, “**nakedness and disarray, like cattle and horses**.” Intoxicated people abandon proper etiquette in dress and may expose themselves, losing their dignity and resembling animals.

Sixth, “**dancing and cursing, causing disgust**.” Drunken individuals often dance erratically and curse those around them, causing others to dislike them.

Seventh, “**failing to obtain what one is due**.” One fails to receive blessings and wealth that were once due because they have damaged their virtue.

Eighth, “**losing what one has already obtained**.” One's belongings are easily misplaced due to forgetfulness.

Ninth, “**secret matters are disclosed, causing regret when sober**.” Private matters are revealed while drunk, leading to deep regret upon sobering up. This can lead to strained friendships or broken relationships.

Tenth, “**making many mistakes while drunk, causing shame when sober**.” Embarrassing acts committed while drunk lead to shame upon becoming sober.

Eleventh, “**the body becomes weak**.” Physical strength deteriorates, becoming feeble.

Twelfth, “**the complexion changes**.” Excessive drinking damages the body, leading to a worsening complexion. Also, one's mood will be erratic and they may be prone to outbursts.

Thirteenth, “**the mind is confused**.” Consuming alcohol destroys the seeds of wisdom, and taking life destroys the seeds of compassion. A person who often kills loses their compassion, while a person who often drinks loses reason, leaving their mind in a constant state of confusion.

Fourteenth, “**wisdom is obscured**.”

Fifteenth, “**lacking respect for parents**.” Many drunk individuals disrespect or even curse their parents, committing a grave offense. A diligent scholar who diligently worked to correct his faults, did not achieve the expected results in his examinations. An enlightened person told him that it was because when his father had reprimanded him as a child, he had glared at him. Such an act of disrespect for parents, who are the source of life, creates a grave offense that must be deeply repented. Therefore, if a person disrespects their parents while drunk, they greatly diminish their blessings.

Sixteenth, “**lacking respect for spirits and deities**.” One should be mindful that spirits and deities are always present. Drunken ramblings can offend them.

Seventeenth, “**disregarding what people say**.” One loses respect for the teachings of sages, for leaders, and even for the words of the head of state, potentially leading to criticism or insults, which is a serious offense.

Eighteenth, “**disregarding the law of the state**.” One fails to respect the laws and regulations of the country, even breaking them.

Nineteenth, “**indulging in debauchery with companions**.” Those who drink with bad company can end up committing crimes, potentially facing legal consequences. As the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* says, “Consorting with bad company will inevitably lead to trouble.” Even if one does not intend to commit crimes, they may be led into it and face the legal consequences.

Twentieth, “**shunning the virtuous and wise**.” Those who enjoy drinking seldom seek the company of those who are kind and virtuous.

Twenty-first, “**shamelessness**.”

Twenty-second, “**easily angered**.” One becomes quick-tempered.

Twenty-third, “**unable to control the six emotions**.” The six emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, and hate, become difficult to manage.

Twenty-fourth, “**indulging in unrestrained lust**.” One engages in unbridled lustful desires. Since our bodies are a gift from our parents, those with filial piety would never do anything that would cause harm or pain to their bodies or to the hearts of their loved ones.

Twenty-fifth, “**those who formerly respected one will leave**.” One’s disrespectful behavior gradually causes those who formerly revered them to become disillusioned and distance themselves.

Twenty-sixth, one becomes careless and arrogant, not knowing discretion.

Twenty-seventh, “**turning day into night, ruining one's livelihood**.” Excessive drinking causes one to be intoxicated even during the day, ruining their career.

Twenty-eighth, “**committing crimes against the moral teachings**.” "Moral teachings" refers to the Confucian emphasis on ethics and morality. When one's behavior under the influence goes against ethical and moral principles, this violates the teachings of the sages.

Twenty-ninth, “**abandoning good deeds**.” One becomes unwilling to do good deeds.

Thirtieth, “**moving away from Nirvana**.” One’s attachment to desires becomes stronger, making it impossible to progress in spiritual cultivation.

Thirty-first, “**planting the seeds of delusion and madness**.” One plants the seeds for a deluded and irrational future.

Thirty-second, “**the body deteriorates, life ends, and one falls into the evil realms**.” These thirty-two negative consequences were compiled from *Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra*, emphasizing the harm of excessive drinking.

How can we remind ourselves to practice restraint and avoid overindulgence? There was a scholar named Chen Hao, who was fond of drinking. He was working as a provincial education supervisor in Shandong when his father passed away. In his father’s will, Chen Hao was instructed to abstain from alcohol. In his filial devotion, he had a small wine cup made and inscribed with eight characters: “My father commanded me to abstain; drink no more than ten cups.” This was a method to control himself.

Beyond self-restraint, moderation in drinking should be an important family rule. In Pujiang (southwest of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province), the Zheng family had the following rules: children under thirty were forbidden from drinking. Those of middle age could drink in small amounts, but if they overindulged, drank heavily, or even cursed others, they would face punishment according to family law, which would include a whipping. When entertaining guests, sincere hospitality was considered essential and guests were never pressured to drink. Furthermore, women were not permitted to sit at the table and drink. Some might consider this unfair to women. However, consider that it is unseemly for a woman to become intoxicated, and women are naturally meant to be subtle and graceful. If a woman drinks excessively and behaves improperly, she may become the subject of ridicule. The family rule stated that those over fifty could exercise their own judgment in drinking, as older individuals are more mature and have a better sense of discretion. This demonstrates how family management emphasized moderation in drinking.

Education emphasizes the importance of preventing problems before they arise: “Prohibiting before something occurs is called foresight.” Teaching children not to be greedy and to understand the harms of alcohol can greatly benefit them throughout life, preventing them from falling into life’s traps. However, if such principles are not taught from a young age, and a child becomes addicted to alcohol, this will bring misfortune to the family, likely leading to its decline.

Let us now look at the next line:

**【When trading with peddlers, do not take advantage. When you see poor or suffering relatives or neighbors, show them kindness and sympathy.】**

“*When trading with peddlers*” means when buying things from street vendors, do not try to take advantage of them. Peddlers have a difficult time making a living; haggling with them and causing them embarrassment is unkind. This is one interpretation. It can also be extended to business partnerships. Never have a thought to try and take advantage of your partners. Instead, remember "give more, take less," which is taught in the *Di Zi Gui* or “push more, take less” as taught in the *Gan Ying Pian*. During the Spring and Autumn period, Bao Shuya was a very kind and generous person who did not take advantage of others. When he and Guan Zhong were in business together, Guan Zhong would take more of the profit. When others pointed this out, Bao Shuya not only did not mind, but he also explained that Guan Zhong's family was poorer and that he should have it, showing consideration for his friend's situation.

As we learn the teachings of the sages, we must begin with kindness. The two characters of “*kindness*” ("厚道" - hòu dào), the first character “厚” (hòu) means “thick.” Only with thick virtue can one carry great things. This character “thick” brings to mind the virtue of the Earth. Traditional culture models itself after Heaven and Earth, and “thick virtue carries all” represents the Earth’s nature, which is profound and solid. This also refers to a person who is very honest, sincere, and prefers to take a loss, rather than take advantage of others. Thus, “thick” represents this meaning. Moreover, “thick” also refers to a slow and continual accumulation. One develops thick virtue through each experience in life. One should seek to “advance in virtue daily, and lessen faults daily,” thereby becoming capable of carrying great responsibilities. The thicker one's virtue, the more significant contributions they can make to their family and society. The second character, “道” (dào) in “kindness,” refers to constantly maintaining compassion and integrity. It means having empathy and putting yourself in other people’s shoes, which is the true spirit of kindness.

In practical terms, if we seek to accumulate virtue, we must start with our words. “Misfortune enters through the mouth and illness enters through the mouth.” Unkind speech creates negative karma. Therefore, we should never publicize the faults of others, as this is a sign of unkindness.

During the Spring and Autumn period, King Zhuang of Chu hosted a banquet for his ministers. Suddenly, a gust of wind extinguished the lamps. As people were drinking and behaving somewhat inappropriately, one minister pulled on the sleeve of the king's consort. The consort acted quickly and pulled off the man's hat tassel. She immediately approached the king and explained, "Someone has acted improperly towards me. When the lights are relit, we can catch the person whose tassel has been pulled off."

Consider this scenario: a man might find it hard to forgive this act toward their consort. They might want to publicly shame the offender. But King Zhuang, as the ruler of a nation, was very magnanimous. He said that since they were at a banquet, he wanted everyone to enjoy themselves and that a little misbehavior might happen while drinking. King Zhuang then ordered everyone to continue drinking and to break their hat tassels so they could truly enjoy themselves. After everyone broke their tassels, when the lights were relit, no one could tell who had been the original offender.

Later, when the Kingdom of Chu was at war with the Kingdom of Jin, the situation was dire. One soldier bravely fought on the battlefield and saved King Zhuang. After the battle was won, the King asked the soldier why he risked his life for him, since the King had not previously shown him any particular favor. The soldier revealed that he was the one whose hat tassel had been pulled off. He had been deeply moved by the King's kindness, so he wanted to repay that kindness.

We can see that not publicizing the faults of others can plant a seed of gratitude that may lead to saving one’s life. Had King Zhuang publicly shamed the man, he might have faced great danger and also created lasting resentment in the man. Thus, one’s way of handling matters can bring good fortune or bring misfortune. By not publicizing the shortcomings of others, we protect them from embarrassment and conceal their faults.

Shen Xin Song, the uncle-in-law of Liao Fan, was very good at this. He would even help others cover up their mistakes. Once, he took his servants to a banquet, where they all became drunk. Usually, they would return by boat, but now the servants were inebriated, so Shen himself had to row the boat to bring them home and then have their wives bring them home to rest. The next day, Shen woke up very late. His wife was very curious, and had never seen him sleep so late, so she called out, "Why are you sleeping so late today?" He was already awake, but he had stayed in bed because he felt if he got up earlier, the servants would be too embarrassed. He wanted to wait until they had all left for work before getting out of bed. How kind that he would be so considerate as to not let others feel embarrassed.

Reflecting on these stories, we can examine ourselves. Before understanding kindness, we might have argued with others, saying things that left them speechless and being proud of our own eloquence. This is very damaging to our virtue. Whether or not one understands these principles greatly affects the course of their life.

Xu Wen Zhen Gong (Xu Jie), a Grand Secretary of the Ming Dynasty, invited guests to his home for a meal. One of the guests was greedy and hid a gold cup in his hat. Xu saw this happen. When the servants were looking for the missing cup, he told them not to look further and that the cup was still there. Later, the guest, who was drunk, fell down, and the cup rolled out of his hat. When Xu saw this, he quickly put the cup back into the man’s hat so as not to embarrass him in front of everyone. This is a sign of a kind person, who values integrity more than material goods. He did not want to destroy the man's reputation over something as trivial as a cup. This demonstrates the power of virtuous actions, where the individual feels a natural sense of shame and regret without having to be publicly shamed.

Kindness first begins with not publicizing others’ faults. Secondly, it means not taking advantage of others, which is a distinctive feature of Chinese culture. For example, when other countries offered gifts to China throughout its history, China always returned gifts of greater value. This showed that China did not want to take advantage of others, and also showcased their hospitality. When we were younger, we may not have had much, but whenever guests came to the house, the best food would be offered to them.

Liao Fan’s aunt and uncle were both very kind. Liao Fan shared some details about their interactions with others. He mentioned that his uncle’s son was sick. A farmer came to visit him out of concern. The aunt mentioned that the farmer had traveled by boat and gave him the boat fare. Then, she treated the farmer to a lavish meal because he was so compassionate in coming to visit. Finally, she sent him away with gifts that were worth more than the gifts he had given. This demonstrated the spirit of kindness and the importance of reciprocity.

This reminds me of my own father, who kept records of all gifts that were given for weddings, funerals, and other important occasions. For example, when my older sister got married, he noted the value of all the gifts, so that when the time came, he could return the same or a larger gift when their daughters got married. My elders demonstrated kindness in many subtle ways.

For example, one should always try to put themselves in others’ shoes. I remember when I was young, older people and neighbors would boil water and leave it outside their homes for travelers to use. Even though they did not know the people, they wanted to be considerate. During meal times, they would invite strangers saying "Come, come eat at our home." All these simple acts demonstrated genuine kindness.


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural flow suitable for a book format:

**Empathy and Benevolence**

This sense of empathy allows us to see that Confucius, if he happened to be attending a funeral, could feel the grief of those mourning as if it were his own. He wouldn't even be able to eat a full meal, such was his constant concern for others. This empathy is a key characteristic of a benevolent heart.

The *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* provides ten striking examples of virtuous deeds that leave a lasting impression. The first example is that of Yang Rong, a Ming dynasty official. His grandfather and great-grandfather earned their living ferrying people across the river by boat. During a great flood, they prioritized rescuing people and left all the goods behind, ignoring the opportunity to seize them.  People in the area even laughed at them for being foolish, missing such a chance to get rich. This shows their consistent compassion and empathy for those in life-threatening situations, as they risked their lives to save others. They even made sure to retrieve the bodies of the deceased for the sake of their families. In ancient times, not being able to find the body of a loved one would be a source of lifelong regret.  Essentially, the core lesson we should learn from all the stories in *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* is that of empathy in our acts of kindness. Another story tells of a scholar who found a person half-frozen in the snow and quickly took him home to save him, feeling his suffering as if it were his own.

Furthermore, the third aspect of “kindness” is knowing gratitude and reciprocating it. "Be mindful of the end and pursue the distant; this will lead the people back to kindness." By cultivating our own kindness, we should never forget those who have been kind to us in our lives. We should always be grateful for the kindness of our teachers and elders and take opportunities, such as during the Spring Festival or other important holidays, to visit them and express our gratitude. Remembering kindness also means remembering old friends.  Being fickle and abandoning old friendships is a mark of unkindness and meanness.

The fourth element is the ability to be unconcerned with petty gains and be willing to take on more responsibilities.

The fifth is being tolerant and forgiving of others. This is another way to nurture our own kindness.  During the Song dynasty, the Prime Minister, Wang Dan, was known for his magnanimity. His colleague, Kou Zhun, would often speak ill of him to the Emperor.  Not only did Wang Dan not hold a grudge, but when the Emperor, after hearing so much criticism, finally said to him, "Look at Kou Zhun, he is being inappropriate, he always criticizes you,” Wang Dan didn’t become upset. Instead, he told the Emperor, "Kou Zhun loves the country. I have been Prime Minister for so long and I must have made many mistakes, so Your Majesty should appreciate his loyalty to the nation." The Emperor was even more impressed by his minister's noble character. As Prime Minister, he was a model for the entire court; his magnanimity would have been emulated by all the civil and military officials.  Wang Dan's tolerance of Kou Zhun was a great merit, creating a culture of tolerance and forbearance throughout the court.

Conversely, if someone in a high position in an organization lacks tolerance, becomes confrontational when criticized, or even creates factions, this will have a very negative impact on the team. The resulting negative karma will be great. Therefore, the higher one's position, the more one should adopt an attitude that ensures every word and action contributes to a better environment for the group. This is why "public service is good cultivation." Officials and those in positions of power have great opportunities for self-improvement because they have a wide sphere of influence.  However, from another perspective, public service is also rife with opportunities for generating negative karma. If they have the wrong attitude, they can lead those under them astray and corrupt the culture, leading to very deep negative karma. This is the fifth point: tolerance and forgiveness.

We have read one story that leaves a particularly deep impression; the degree of tolerance shown is truly moving. There was a Minister named Ma Sen, a kind of Minister of Education. His father had him at around the age of forty, and he was a cherished son. One day, a maidservant accidentally dropped the child, and his head hit the ground, killing him instantly. Upon learning this, his first action was to ensure the maid was safe and to send her home quickly.  A father who had waited forty years for a son was faced with inconsolable loss, yet he did not become angry; he immediately thought of the maidservant and ensured she could leave safely. He even stated that it was his own carelessness that led to the child’s death. His wife was overcome with grief. She could not control her emotions, repeatedly striking him in despair. Then, suddenly she asked, "Where did the maidservant go?" She was told that she had already left.

The maidservant returned home.  When her parents learned of what had happened, they prayed to heaven every day, asking that this kind man not be left without descendants. Their sincere prayers touched Heaven. Soon after, his wife became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, who grew up to be the very Ma Sen, the Minister of Education. Furthermore, Ma Sen was born with a birthmark on his head. Do you know why?

When I was studying at the Pure Land Institute in Australia, I participated in a scientific research study about reincarnation. Scientists had observed that people born with birthmarks often have them as a result of injuries in their past lives.  For example, if a person was severely beaten in a certain spot, and the injury led to their death. The physical body dies, but the spirit lives on. Confucius said, “Essence and energy become matter, and the wandering soul transforms.” The body is simply a tool, and when it is broken, a new tool is acquired. But the intense emotions of the moment of death, such as the pain, can imprint itself on the new body in the form of a birthmark. Some people are born with a fear of water. When they are taken to a swimming pool, they become terrified. Others are not afraid; but why this particular person? Understanding that they died by drowning in a past life helps to explain the fear.  The human soul is immortal, but deep impressions are formed, which create psychological effects.  Thinking about this, does anyone have fears? Let them go. They are in the past. Do not torment yourself. Or perhaps something in this life still angers you intensely; if you do not let go, you will just bring suffering on yourself. It's all in the past. Be kind, be tolerant, be forgiving. By forgiving others, you also liberate yourself.

The sixth principle is empathy, as I have already mentioned. I previously shared that Mr. Yang Chengzhai’s wife, even in her seventies, would wake up very early to prepare hot porridge for her servants. This shows that she treated everyone who came into contact with her as a family member.  I imagine that such a leader would be deeply loved by those under her charge.  Many wealthy people in the past would treat their maids very well, thinking of their future, by teaching them to be wise, so that they would have a better chance at a happy life after they were married.

The seventh principle is not to blame or embarrass others. If something has already happened, then scolding will only harm one’s own kindness and cause the other party further distress. Han Qi, a famous minister, was reading late one night. The soldier holding the lamp beside him became distracted for a moment and accidentally singed his beard. He didn’t turn his head; he just extinguished the small flame with his hand. After a while, he noticed something was amiss and looked around. The soldier had been replaced. He asked, “Where is the person who was holding the lamp?” His subordinates said that he had been removed because he had burned the General. Han Qi insisted that they find him and bring him back; since he already knew how to avoid burning people, he should be kept.

Think about this; if the soldier had really been removed, he would have certainly been punished and would have difficulty with his career going forward. He couldn’t bear the thought of blaming him for such a minor mistake, and he wanted him to return. I imagine that the soldier must have served Han Qi with absolute loyalty for the rest of his life.  And not just that soldier; he must have told this story to many others. All those who heard of the General's kindness and compassion for his subordinates must have been deeply moved, and that must have boosted the morale of the entire army.  Why were these scholars able to lead armies to such great fame in the past? It was because they showed kindness in every interaction with their subordinates. “Those who love others will be loved, and those who respect others will be respected.”

This principle of not blaming or embarrassing others was exemplified by Doctor Heo Jun in the Korean drama “Hur Jun, The Original Story.”  He was going to take the medical officer exam when he discovered that there were sick people in a certain area. He took a detour to treat them and managed to cure them.  Just as he was about to leave, many others, who had no money for medical treatment, came to him.  He put off his journey to help them. Even when it was past his scheduled arrival time, he opened the door to find even more people waiting. People from neighboring villages, hearing of such a good doctor, had all come to seek his help. He couldn’t bear to leave them.  When he finally felt he could no longer stay, he was about to leave when a villager named Manseok forced him to go to his home because his mother was very ill.

Though he knew he would miss his exam, he did his best to treat his mother. Then, he gave the money he had on him to Manseok, knowing his family was poor and that his mother needed nourishing food to recover. Manseok was so moved that he burst into tears, saying, “It’s all my fault that you can't take your exam.” The doctor, showing his great kindness, tried to comfort him. He said, "Don't worry, I haven't slept for so many days. My mother told me that after a person dies, they can rest well. So, it's okay that I haven't slept these past few days. If I hurry, I can still make it." In reality, he had no chance of making it on time.  Just through this example, we can appreciate how incredibly kind he was.

There are countless examples of acts of kindness, as virtuous people have been born into our Chinese culture generation after generation. As long as we take note of the behavior of people in the past, and even the actions of our friends and relatives, and cultivate the desire to emulate good deeds when we see them, we will learn.

The next line says, “When you see poor or distressed relatives and neighbors, show warmth and compassion.” We should do our best to love and help them and empathize with their difficulties.  This is also very important.  Neighbors, although not blood relatives, are important because, as the saying goes, “A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor; a close neighbor is not as good as a next-door neighbor.” Growing up, many of us have cherished memories of very close relationships with neighbors. Relatives may not live close by, but if there is anything we need, we can rely on our neighbors every day.  Of course, we must remember these kindnesses, and when they are in need, we should do all that we can to help them.

Actually, in life, we should do our best to fulfill our duty.  We have a responsibility towards all those in our five fundamental human relationships.  Siblings should love each other; parents should be kind, and children should be filial. We should also extend the concept of "father" to include uncles, elders, and other family members, all of whom we should respect. People of the same generation should all treat each other with affection. “If all family members are of the same mind as their ancestors, there will be no disharmony in the family.” If we were to view all our family members through the eyes of our ancestors, we would see they are all descendants of the same family.  We should love and care for them on behalf of our ancestors.

Furthermore, honestly, the ability to help others today is a blessing. "A family that accumulates good deeds is sure to have blessings in the future.”  This blessing has been given to us by our ancestors, so we have a responsibility to care for their family well.  Fan Zhongyan understood this principle. He was an expert on the *Book of Changes* which says, "A family that accumulates good deeds is sure to have blessings in the future." Therefore, he told his children: “My prosperity today is due to the merit of our ancestors. I cannot squander this inherited merit. Instead, I must use it to take good care of our family.”  The Fan family cared for several hundred family members, as detailed in the "Record of the Righteous Land."

He not only cared for his relatives but also his neighbors and other impoverished scholars. He cared for them well and nurtured them; many of them later became pillars of the nation. There are so many examples, but we can mention Zhang Zai.  He was one of those whom Fan Zhongyan had taken care of. We are all familiar with Zhang Zai's famous saying: "To establish the heart for heaven and earth, to establish destiny for the people, to continue the lost teachings of the sages, and to bring peace for all generations to come." He was a person nurtured by Fan Zhongyan. "To find and develop capable people for the country is called benevolence.” Helping a nation to discover and develop talent, and teaching and transforming local populations, so that many people benefit, is true benevolence.

Therefore, in speaking with his children, he made sure they understood that caring for all family members would bring peace to the spirits of their ancestors. And indeed, Fan Zhongyan's descendants far exceeded their ancestors in their accomplishments. During Fan Zhongyan's time, the righteous land (land whose proceeds were used to support family and community) was 1,000 mu, but by the Qing Dynasty, the righteous land had grown to 4,000 mu.  If virtue and righteousness are passed down through the family, how could it be possible for such a family to lack blessings?

Prior to Fan Zhongyan, Yan Ying from the Spring and Autumn period, was a good example. Fan Zhongyan would also often encourage his children with the example of Dou Yujun from the Five Dynasties period. You see, these wise sages, who have left their names in history, have made great contributions to our entire nation. Yan Ying, as mentioned in the “Record of the Righteous Land,” took care of hundreds of relatives, but he himself wore the same clothes for thirty years, he was that frugal.  Fan Zhongyan did not even have money for his own coffin when he died because he did not keep money for himself. When he had money, he would spend it to help others. He left behind his legacy of “helping the poor and sustaining the clan."  His four children were all very successful, including his second son, Fan Chunren, who rose to a position even higher than his father.

Buddhism, in its scriptures, also speaks of our responsibilities towards our relatives and friends.  Seven rules are listed:

First, "To give what is difficult to give." The word "give" means to be generous, to give to others. Even when it’s difficult for ourselves, we cannot bear to watch our relatives and friends suffer.  This reminds me of what Lin Wenzhong, or Lin Zexu, did. When he was young, his uncle's family was in great difficulty. His mother learned of this and gave most of the remaining food in their house to her brother-in-law. She instructed Lin not to tell anyone, fearing that her brother-in-law would feel embarrassed. She would rather suffer hardship herself than watch her relatives in pain. This is the kind of mother that could raise a pillar of the nation.  If she had been petty and calculating, how could she have raised a son with such a big heart? The foundation of peace in the world rests with the education of women.  If we study history, we will see that all mothers of wise sages were virtuous women of great character, especially in terms of generosity and integrity.

Second, "To do what is difficult to do." What others refuse to do, we actively undertake, without being petty or calculating. For example, the story of “Younger Sister-in-law’s Gratitude to her Sisters-in-law” tells of the fifth daughter-in-law, who witnessed the constant arguments and fights of her older sisters-in-law. She took on most of the household work herself, saying that she was the youngest and it was her duty to serve them. That is an example of "giving what is difficult to give." She gave the good things she received from her own family to her sisters-in-law and nephews.

Third, "To endure what is difficult to endure." It is inevitable that there will be friction, misunderstandings, accusations, or even rude treatment when living together.  One must practice tolerance and be forgiving, refusing to be petty.  In reality, if people owe you, heaven will repay you.  A woman who always considers the harmony of the whole family may experience many unfair situations, but she should always keep the well-being of the whole family in mind.  Such women will be greatly blessed in their later years.

My mother, as the eldest daughter-in-law, was a perfect example of this principle. After she married into my family, my father left for university the very next day. He was still a student and had no income. My mother's salary became the family income. She had to care for my grandparents, my younger aunts and uncles, as well as teach in a school with over sixty students in her class. It was hard work, and she still had to cook breakfast and manage the household.  I think modern young women would not be willing to marry under such conditions.  My entire family is deeply grateful to my mother. My aunts, uncles, and grandparents all loved her very much.  People shouldn’t fear being taken advantage of; they shouldn’t fear hard work. My mother has had a good life in her later years. After retiring, she has spent one or two decades studying classic texts of traditional culture; she is being rewarded for her past sacrifices.

Fourth, "To talk candidly in private." It's inevitable that people will have difficult times in life when they are carrying heavy burdens and need a trusted person to whom they can unburden their hearts.  We should be good listeners, offering words of comfort and guidance. We should also be grateful for their trust in us. But, we must not reveal to others what they have shared with us in confidence.  If we do so, we would cause them to feel ashamed and humiliated; we would have destroyed their trust in us.

Fifth, "Not to abandon each other in hardship." When relatives or friends are suffering, we must not abandon them. We should rise to the occasion and help them.

Sixth, "Not to despise those in poverty." Even if they are poor, we must not look down on them. We should always appreciate the kindness they have shown us.  Even if we ourselves achieve high positions and wealth, our gratitude and respect should never change. When we see relatives or friends in need, not only should we help them, we should do our best to elevate them so they can develop and grow. This is also our duty.

"Those who fulfill these seven rules can be called family and friends." Only when we are able to fulfill these seven rules can we say we are doing our duty to our relatives and friends.  Therefore, we should strive to understand and put these teachings into practice, starting with: “When you see poor or distressed relatives and neighbors, show warmth and compassion.”

**The Dangers of Meanness**

“A family built on meanness cannot last long; when the principles of human relationships are distorted, it will quickly disappear.”

“Meanness” is the opposite of kindness.  We have discussed how kindness brings virtue. Meanness harms virtue.  A career or a family that has been established through meanness is not built on noble ideals and will not last long. It will not be blessed.  Because Heaven "hates what is mean and what is cunning." Meanness is the opposite of Heaven’s love for all life. "Cunning" refers to clever tricks, and a kind person would never stoop to such behavior.  Furthermore, if "the principles of human relationships are distorted," meaning if we deviate from the proper order in our family life, such as if there is conflict between father and son, if husband and wife are unrighteous, or if there is conflict between siblings, the family will be on the verge of collapse and will soon fall. Next time, we will discuss some real examples so that we can better understand how important this teaching is for the prosperity of our families.

Okay, that is all I have to share today. Thank you, everyone!


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional and accurate rendition while preserving the nuances of the original Chinese:

**Lecture Ten: Fulfilling Social Roles and Responsibilities for a Flourishing Family**

Respected elders and friends, good afternoon to you all! The *I Ching* says, "A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have abundant blessings; a family that accumulates bad deeds will surely have abundant calamities." Therefore, fortune and misfortune, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, reside within a single thought. This applies not only to our own fortune and misfortune but also to that of our descendants. Our Chinese nation is founded upon ethics and morality. All professions emphasized virtue: the ruler had the way of a ruler, officials treated the people with the heart of a parent; teachers had the way of a teacher, merchants had the way of a merchant. It is because of this emphasis on morality and doing good that our nation is the only one in the world that has endured for five thousand years. This is not accidental. And when we look at the scriptures, we see that happiness and suffering, blessings and disasters, are all also a matter of a single thought. If we act according to these scriptural verses, we do good, and that brings forth blessings. If we don't, we do evil, and that brings forth calamities. Therefore, the correct attitude to life and the world is extremely important. Like the verse we discussed last time:

"A family built on harshness will not endure."

As parents, when we see the words "harshness" and "stinginess," can we discern whether it will lead to fortune or misfortune? Once, Confucius was with the ruler of the state of Lu, and the ruler asked, "Is it auspicious to build the house to the right?" The ruler was worried about the feng shui of his house. Confucius took this opportunity to tell the ruler about the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of a person and even of a country. Because if the ruler’s understanding is correct, the entire nation will be blessed. If a leader of a group has the right view, that group will be blessed.

Let me give you an example: In Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, there is a company called Gude Group, and the chairman is Mr. Wu Nianbo. Last November, I stayed in the same room as Mr. Wu when we were in Sri Lanka. This May, we met in Paris, and coincidentally, we were in the same room again. The company he leads is called a "Happy Enterprise." This means that in addition to wanting his own life to be happy, he also hopes that all of his employees are happy, and that their families are also happy. The Chinese traditional culture courses that he runs are not only for his employees to learn but also for their families to study with them. Furthermore, he wants the community to be happy. More than 300 of his company's employees volunteer as volunteers, providing environmental services for the entire city of Suzhou, including their own communities, even on their days off. Many local disabled children and children with cerebral palsy are cared for by his employees, who are very compassionate. One child with cerebral palsy, who originally could not speak, ended up calling the employee who cared for her "mom" after a long period of interaction. Don’t underestimate the feelings of a child even with cerebral palsy; they also have awareness and feelings. So, Mr. Wu's idea of happiness is for employees, as well as for the society and country, and even for the people of the world, to be happy. Can this be achieved? We must first have firm confidence. Only then can we learn solidly. If, while learning, we keep thinking: is that really true? Is it really like that? Then, these verses cannot enter our hearts.

As we just mentioned, our ancestors founded their society on ethics and morality. The *Great Learning* begins with, "The Way of great learning consists in manifesting the clear virtue, in loving the people, and in resting in perfect goodness." From Mr. Wu's life, we can see that his mind has become increasingly broad, and he thinks about the people of the world. Therefore, his clear virtue is increasingly manifest. Now, if people's values are wrong and they chase fame and profit, they become consumed by greed. The more they live, the more they lose their peace of mind, and the less they can smile. Nowadays, it’s not just one or two people who cannot smile, but a widespread social phenomenon.

In reality, it is not easy to live in this society, no matter how hard one tries. It's not easy now to build a career, educate children, or cultivate oneself and manage a family. Even if you try hard, the result may not be good. The direction must be right. How do we ensure we’re on the right path? It’s by constantly letting go of bad habits, reducing our afflictions, so that wisdom grows. The more desires we have, the more we seek without obtaining, the more suffering we will accumulate. The value of life lies in constantly elevating our wisdom and spirituality.

Furthermore, the phrase “in loving the people” means to benefit more people; this is where value lies. "Helping others brings joy, and doing good is the greatest joy." This is the correct value system. If we are on the right path, our children will also have happy lives. Therefore, when parents and leaders have correct values, their children and employees will be happy. Mr. Wu has over 2,000 employees. He takes the lead in learning traditional culture, sitting in the first seat as class monitor, with each term around 160 employees taking turns to participate, including their family members. As the courses progress, many employees have undergone major changes. Therefore, "At the beginning of humanity, their natures are good."

One employee’s child, who had never called his father since his twenties, learned to reflect and repent after participating in the course and started calling his father, thus learning filial piety. Another employee’s wife, who had never called her father-in-law, learned about filial piety after taking the course and started calling him. Sometimes, listening to these stories, one wonders how these families even got through the days. Imagine a son not even calling his father; how painful that must be for the father? And the son, how ruthless is he? Right? To be able to become such close family members under one roof is a rare karmic bond, as the saying goes, "It takes a hundred years to share a boat ride and a thousand years to share a pillow." I believe that this kind of corporate leader has accumulated immense invisible merits, an immeasurable amount of good deeds. Some people’s children hadn’t been taught to be sensible even after thirty or forty years, and he was able to teach them. I believe that the parents and families of these employees may be burning incense and praying to heaven every day, asking for blessings for this compassionate leader.

One of his employees, who enjoyed fishing, learned about cherishing life and cultivating compassion from *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. As a result, he stopped fishing and now participates in release activities. The change was significant. Fishing harms life. How can one expect to live to a hundred years of age? "The benevolent live long," meaning that being kind to people and kind to life leads to longevity. Conversely, harming life shortens one's lifespan.

There are many examples of people who were willing to change after understanding these principles. For example, someone who had smoked for decades learned, "Our bodies, hair, and skin are received from our parents; we dare not harm them, this is the beginning of filial piety." Everyone knows that smoking is harmful to the body. How do parents feel when they see their child smoking? Especially when they read in the newspapers and other articles about how the rate of lung cancer is high among smokers, this is a great concern for parents. As a child, one should try to alleviate parental concerns about one's health, character, and family as soon as possible. This is just the basic fulfillment of filial piety. Later, when the employee learned that “Our bodies, hair, and skin are received from our parents; we dare not harm them, this is the beginning of filial piety," they understood that caring for one’s body was the start of filial piety. These employees quit smoking when they understood this principle.

In addition to benefiting all the employees of the company and their families, Mr. Wu once attended a business seminar by Peter Drucker, an American management guru. Although Peter Drucker has passed away, many organizations are still studying his theories. This seminar also invited a person who is very influential in the South Korean business world, the person in charge of a "New Paradigm" management system. During the seminar, Mr. Wu was invited to share his experience on how to run a "Happy Enterprise." The person in charge of this “New Paradigm” listened to Mr. Wu talk about his company’s concepts, including the fact that the 2,000 plus employees did not need to clock in. Since they have a family-like culture, why would people need to clock in when they are “going home”? Many of the employees come to work from other provinces, so their families often travel for very long hours on the train. Sometimes when they arrive at Suzhou at three or four in the morning, the managers of the company will arrange a "Warm Welcome Car Team," to personally pick up the employee's family members. You can just imagine, when the employee’s family step out of the train station with their luggage, they see not only their children but also their children’s managers greeting them. This is very heartwarming and reassures them that their children are well taken care of in this organization.

Last Mid-Autumn Festival, the company sent the best mooncakes in China to every employee’s parents by express delivery. In addition to the mooncakes, each delivery included a handwritten letter from the employee to their parents, usually expressing gratitude for their upbringing. Think about it: When these employees’ families, especially their parents, receive the mooncakes and the handwritten letter from their child, I imagine that over half of the children have never written a letter to their parents in their entire lives. Many parents shed tears of emotion.

One employee who had left the company five years ago was diagnosed with a serious illness. When the company heard about it, all 2,000 plus employees immediately started a charity donation drive. The female employee was very touched and said, "Even though I left five years ago, they still care for me like family. I’ve been sick for a while, and my own company hasn’t even come to see me.” Thus, employees in this company have a very strong sense of belonging.

One employee from Guizhou brought over 100 people from his hometown to work in the company. If one employee brings more than one hundred relatives and friends to work, what about the others? Now many companies have high employee turnover. You invest years in training them, and then they leave, resulting in a great loss for the company. How much expense does this kind of cohesion save the company? The person in charge of the South Korean "New Paradigm" system, who was originally studying Peter Drucker's management theories, was so moved when he heard of these results that he immediately told Mr. Wu, "Greater Asia should have an Eastern style of management," and invited him to give a lecture in South Korea. Does this company possess qualities that “govern” and “pacify” a nation? There are now over 2,000 companies in China who have visited this company for the purposes of learning from them.

Recently, when we went to the Institut de France in France, they had been studying sinology for hundreds of years. There are many top-level sinologists there. After my teacher gave a lecture, we had dinner together. During dinner, we shared our thoughts. I said, “Sinology is the study of the mind and nature. It contains the wisdom for cultivating oneself, managing a family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. It can help people make their careers better and their families flourish for thousands of years.” When the sinologist heard me say that “careers can be made better,” his eyes widened. He said, “What does sinology have to do with making a career?”

Were you surprised to hear that?  A person who has studied sinology for decades wonders what sinology has to do with running a business or a career? What have the Shanxi merchants, the Anhui merchants, and the Zhejiang merchants relied on for their businesses to thrive for hundreds of years? They depended on the wisdom of Chinese ethics and morality. How can sinology be unrelated to doing business? When there is no teacher guiding one in sinology and the teachings of the sages, then even the most intelligent person will just treat them as knowledge and academics and miss the fact that it is actually real wisdom. I saw his eyes widen, so I had to give him examples.

So I went on to tell this sinologist, for example, that one department wanted to scrap a machine worth several hundred thousand yuan. Later, after the employees took a course and learned to respect all people, matters, and things, they carefully inspected the machine's problems when they returned and eventually fixed it. Just think, how much money was saved? Hundreds of thousands? On the surface, several hundred thousand were saved. In the long run? How much machinery and resources will be saved by cultivating this attitude? Furthermore, will this example influence the rest of the company? How much more money will be saved? When they become managers in the future, they will instill this attitude of responsibility and diligence in their subordinates. How much more money will be saved then? It's impossible to calculate this, isn't it?

Therefore, who makes the greatest contribution to traditional culture? It is the people who apply traditional culture to their work and their family life, and become a good example for the whole world. The merit is too great to calculate.

When I gave the sinologist this example, he immediately said, “Yes, that makes sense!” This example was something I had just learned the night before. Mr. Wu, who was staying in the same room as me, had received an email about it from his company, and he showed it to me. After I shared this with the sinologist, he was convinced. I told him, “The CEO of that company is sitting right in front of you.” He was extremely happy and just listened to Mr. Wu. He was delighted and immediately told Mr. Wu, “I want to bring the sinologists to visit your company.” Do you believe that the perception of these sinologists, who originally only studied knowledge and academia, will change regarding sinology? Therefore, groups that implement traditional culture will move sinologists around the world, and even the world’s views on sinology.

As we just talked about, Confucius told his ruler that it was not inauspicious to build a house to the right, but that there were five things that were truly inauspicious. First, "To harm others for one's own gain is inauspicious for oneself." Harming others to benefit oneself is the wrong attitude in life, and will ultimately only bring disasters upon oneself. Harm will always be counterproductive. Why? “Heaven’s way is just to return.” What you do will eventually come back to you. There is an old saying: "To hit someone is like hitting yourself, and to scold someone is like scolding yourself." If we contemplate this carefully, you will see when you hit someone, that the opportunity will eventually come for the other person to retaliate, and that the negative energy will come back to you.

The *Great Learning* also says, "What goes out in contradiction will surely return in contradiction." When you curse others, that negative effect will eventually come back to you. "Wealth gained through improper means will be lost through improper means," meaning that any wealth you obtain through dishonest means will not last, and will in fact bring disaster. As we mentioned earlier, “Do not be greedy for unexpected wealth.” Harming others will never be beneficial to oneself. And, as we mentioned before, "A family built on harshness will not endure." Harshness towards others harms them. How could it possibly benefit you?

Mencius said, "When a ruler treats his ministers as his hands and feet," a leader should treat his subordinates like his brothers and sisters, "then the ministers will treat the ruler as his heart and soul." Relationships between people are mutual. If you are good to others, they will naturally be good to you. "If a ruler treats his ministers like dogs and horses," if you treat them like dogs and horses and ignore their feelings and health, "then the ministers will treat the ruler as a person from the street." The subordinates will treat the leader as if they were just a stranger. When work is over, they won’t even want to greet him. "If a ruler treats his ministers like dirt," if a leader looks down upon their subordinates, treating them like trash, "then the ministers will treat the ruler as their enemy." The subordinates will treat the leader like an enemy.

If one is harsh to others, the result will certainly be resentment. If parents are harsh, their children will be even harsher. Thus, it is often the case that man’s plans do not match heaven's plans. In the end, your child may turn out to be even more harsh than you, which will result in a difficult life for you. If you practice kindness and cultivate kindness in your children, then your family will be harmonious and everything will flourish. Therefore, there should be no harshness in the family or in the organization.

In Mr. Wu's extended family, there is a foreman who was in charge of about seven or eight people. Before studying traditional culture, this foreman would say to his subordinates who called in sick, "You are not allowed to be absent. If you don’t come in immediately, I'll dock three days of your pay." He was quite harsh. The employees who were treated like that were resentful. What was the result of that attitude? The people below did not understand him, and the people above were demanding results, so he was trapped in the middle.

Later, after learning these principles, he understood that he needed to be kind and respect his employees. He changed his attitude. When his employees called in sick, he immediately showed concern and asked, "Are you feeling unwell? Or is there something happening with your family?" After hearing their explanation, he would say, "Okay, I will approve a few hours of leave for you. Go take care of your matter. You can come back when you're done." Instead of blaming or berating them, he was showing concern and offering help. After this change, the subordinates became more supportive and would actively help him with many things. The opportunities that we encounter in life are greatly affected by a single thought. The problem may not lie on the outside, but rather in our own attitude. Therefore, if you cannot obtain the understanding and support of the people around you, you must look back and adjust your own attitude. He went from being trapped in the middle to becoming a happy foreman.

Therefore, we must not be harsh with the world, otherwise we will lose our blessings. If a family is without blessings, the family’s wealth will decline, so “it will not endure.” But if you look at all the kind and virtuous sages, their families have prospered for a long time. Duke Fan was very kind and generous. He helped many of his clan members and those who were in poverty, and his family prospered for eight or nine hundred years.

Han Qi was also a great general and a wise minister. He was very kind, and he empathized even with his soldiers. Once when he was writing a letter, a soldier was holding the lamp for him. The soldier lost his focus for a moment, and the flame burned his sideburn. He simply put the fire out. A little while later, when he noticed that the soldier had been replaced, he immediately told them to bring back the soldier. The officers said that the soldier had burned the general’s sideburn, so they had to replace him. Han Qi said, "It's okay, he already knows how to avoid burning me again. Put him back." Actually, the most important thing is that Han Qi could imagine that if the soldier were not put back, he might be severely punished. What compassion! As a matter of fact, when he did this, the whole army saw how tolerant their general was and the morale of the army was greatly boosted. Therefore, the descendants of General Han also fared very well. Kind people can leave lasting blessings to their descendants.

The next sentence says:
“When proper moral relationships are disrupted, their decline is immediate.”

“Moral relationships” refer to the five relationships, which we often mention. If we violate common sense and engage in conflict, or act without following the proper moral conduct of the five relationships, for example “fatherly kindness and filial piety,” fathers should be kind, and children should be filial. If a father is not kind, he is not fulfilling his role as a father. If a child is not filial, they are not fulfilling their role as a child. Each of the five relationships consists of fulfilling one’s responsibilities, which is referred to as the ten righteousnesses. In life, these are fundamental. If you cannot fulfill the duties of the five relationships, you are not even qualified to be human. How can you expect your family to prosper? Thus, the result is immediate decline, and the family may fall into decay and collapse.

If we look at the father-son relationship, we hear examples of children harming their parents, and the family's decline is immediately noticeable. However, the reason for such rebellious behavior in children is because their parents neglected the importance of educating them. Our ancestors have left us a saying, "Nothing is more important than teaching one’s children.” When we see the rebellious behavior of children now, we see the destruction of the family. This shows the importance of education. As children, we should fulfill our filial duties and set a good example for our children. To be filial, our words and actions must be filial, but we also need to show true gratitude from our hearts. We must be grateful for our parents' kindness. We cannot just be doing it superficially.

There was a scholar named Yu Lin, a scholarship student from Taiyuan, Shanxi province. He was studying under the national scholarship program, but had not yet passed the civil service exams to qualify him for a government post. After passing the exams, he would be conferred the title of “Juren” or “Jinshi” which could lead to being appointed to a government position. He had read a lot of books, and many people thought he was a filial son. People would come from afar to learn from him, but he always failed the exams. Later, he found out that he was supposed to have passed the exams, but because of his attitude toward his parents, he was respectful on the surface, but resentful in his heart. This is called “secretly slandering”. He was performing actions superficially. This caused him to deplete his own blessings. Therefore, he was not able to pass his exams despite having the chance, because he had depleted his blessings.

Secretly slandering means that in his everyday life, Yu Lin would disagree with everything his parents said and did. He would not acknowledge their correctness and only pretend to be respectful. He would treat his parents as if they were strangers, which angered the heaven and gods most. In the end, he never passed the civil service exams. “When proper moral relationships are disrupted, their decline is immediate." The family’s wealth declined.

The husband-wife relationship is also of utmost importance. Husband and wife are united by a shared responsibility and should support each other and not keep secrets from each other. The entire process of traditional Chinese marriage ceremonies was educational, constantly reminding people of their sense of responsibility and moral obligations. During the ceremony, the groom brings the bride home. After entering the home, the couple will drink from shared cups. The wine is sweet, and the cups were originally made from one gourd, split into two. This signifies that once the wine is drunk, the couple will share both happiness and hardship. The wine is sweet, representing their shared happiness, and the gourd’s flesh is bitter, representing the shared hardships. The gourd, when joined, forms one, representing that the husband and wife are one and cannot be separated.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a natural English tone, while maintaining the original meaning and nuances:

**A Marriage Reminder: The Attitude That Must Be Upheld For Life, Never Wronging Your Wife**

There's a reminder concerning marriage: the attitude one must uphold for life, never to betray one's wife.

In ancient times, there was a man named Shi Tang. He married while poor. Later, he passed the imperial examinations, became an official, and instead of being grateful for his wife's support and care, he resented her, thinking that he had married too early and missed the chance to marry into a wealthy family. Even more cruelly, he refused to share a bed with her or even see her. His wife, facing such a situation, naturally grew melancholy and became gravely ill. She was sick for a long time, and Shi Tang never once went to see her. Her resentment deepened, and as she lay dying, with her husband in the next room, she cried out, "I am about to die. Won't you even look at me before I pass?" Still, Shi Tang refused to see his wife.

After she died, he felt uneasy, some conscience still remained. However, instead of a sincere repentance, he went so far as to bind her body tightly, to press down on her corpse. It seems he had heard some bad advice, treating his wife with such viciousness even after her death. Her father, in a dream, had his daughter appear to him. She said, "Father, you married me to a bad man. My life has been filled with sorrow and resentment, and even in death, my husband presses down upon me." She added, "Because my husband treated me this way, his blessings and lifespan have been cut short." Indeed, Shi Tang died within a year. This is an example of how "disrupted family relations lead to immediate ruin." Shi Tang's own blessings and life were completely destroyed. The relationships between father and son, husband and wife, and siblings are crucial family relationships.

Regarding sibling relationships, there was a pair of brothers in Yunnan. Their father died early, and their mother lived with the younger brother. When their father passed away, he left behind several thousand dollars (actually not a lot of money in Chinese currency). The younger brother didn't care for their mother well, so the older brother took their mother in. After that, the older brother’s wife would often complain, "Now that we are taking care of Mom, at the very least, we should receive some of the money that our father left behind." She kept pressuring her husband. She even told her son, who was in college, and gradually, he developed resentment towards his uncle.

One day, this son went with his classmates to beat up his uncle. However, the uncle wasn’t home, and the aunt quickly locked the doors and windows, preventing them from entering. Angry, the nephew and his classmates threw stones at the windows. When the uncle returned and saw the damage, the aunt added fuel to the fire, saying, "Your nephew isn’t afraid of death. He wants to fight you. Do you have the courage?" The uncle, enraged, took a knife (he was a butcher) and went to his older brother’s house. He severely injured his nephew and his classmate. The older brother rushed back from the fields, embraced his younger brother, and tried to reason with him, but the younger brother was still consumed with anger and stabbed his older brother several times. Their elderly mother witnessed this entire scene, which must have broken her heart. So, the phrase, "immediate ruin," is indeed true.

Let us calmly reflect on this tragedy. The elder brother’s wife lost her husband, and the younger brother's wife’s husband will likely be imprisoned for a long time. This is a tragedy for the whole family. Yet, if even one person in that family had been calm, rational, and had learned traditional culture, this disaster could have been avoided. Therefore, sharing traditional culture with relatives and friends is like putting out a fire—it is extremely urgent. When people lack understanding, they act on impulse.

Think about it: if the older brother's wife hadn’t been so concerned about those few thousand dollars, would this tragedy have happened? If the aunt hadn’t stirred up trouble, would this tragedy have happened? The nephew, a college student, resorted to beating up his uncle as a solution. What did he learn in school for all those years? So, the purpose of education is to gain understanding and learn how to conduct oneself. If I were this nephew's elementary school teacher, I should kneel before our ancestors and apologize. I have also failed in my duty. "If one neglects to teach, the father is at fault. If teaching is not strict, the teacher is lazy." Perhaps, when my life ends, Yama, the King of the Underworld, will also hold me accountable. His classmate also attempted to resolve the problem in a violent manner. This highlights how moral character must be prioritized in higher education. As we ponder this situation, and see the patterns in our current society, we can see this is a very crucial reminder. From these stories, we should understand that in the future, no matter what conflicts arise within our families, we must learn to be tolerant.

Consider Zhang Gongyi, a scholar from the Tang Dynasty. His nine generations all lived together under one roof. The emperor greatly admired him and asked, "How can so many of you live together so harmoniously?" Zhang Gongyi diligently wrote an answer for the emperor. When the emperor received it, what did he see? One hundred characters meaning "endure."  It’s very profound. When you have disagreements with family members, what should you do? Endure. If you truly can't endure it? Endure again. If you can summon the endurance a hundred times, your anger will dissipate. The more you endure, controlling your initial impulse, the more time for everyone to calm down, the more likely they’ll see their fault. However, if you can't endure and clash, a small matter can escalate into something huge. So, the harmony of family relationships is incredibly critical – the key to a family’s rise and fall.

Yang Jicheng (also known as Master Jiaoshan), a loyal official from the Ming Dynasty, understood this principle very well. He was loyal and righteous, daring to confront the corrupt official Yan Song. Later, he was framed and imprisoned. His conscience was clear. The day before his execution, he wrote a letter to his children. These virtuous individuals sought only to live without shame before heaven and earth, and faced death without fear: "Look up, and be ashamed of no one; look down, and be ashamed of no one."  Most ordinary people would be frantic the day before their execution. In his letter, he told his children that if one of them were to take another to court, that brother should present his letter to the officials. The officials should then use that letter to punish the brother who sued his own sibling, because “Family disputes should be avoided, for lawsuits lead to ultimate ruin.” They understood perfectly that “disrupted family relationships lead to immediate ruin.”

We see many wealthy families today who sue each other over money, causing utter chaos. This is all “disrupted family relationships lead to immediate ruin.” Have you ever heard of a wealthy family that has become richer and more prosperous because they sued over inheritance?  No. Doesn’t that seem unreasonable? For thousands of years, and even in modern times, no family that has sued over property has ever become more successful.  So, why would people still do this? Isn’t it foolish? Therefore, we must resolve our problems by following classic teachings and reason, not with impulsive actions.

Wu Zitian, a scholar from the Ming Dynasty, lost his mother at a young age. His father remarried, and his stepmother, Tang, was cruel and abused him. Later, he married Sun. His stepmother continued to mistreat him. He could no longer tolerate it and wanted to confront her. However, Sun advised her husband, "After all, she is your stepmother. As children, we shouldn’t behave this way.” After his father passed away, he left behind a substantial amount of money and land. The stepmother, Tang, hid the money and divided the land into three parts. She kept the good land for herself and her biological son and gave the worst land to Wu Zitian. Wu Zitian could no longer bear it and wanted to confront his stepmother about the money. As a woman, if you were his wife, what would you do? Outrageous! Absolutely not tolerable! Would you go and argue with your husband? If you argued, "disrupted family relations lead to immediate ruin.” Therefore, "a virtuous wife reduces her husband’s troubles." This wife, through her virtue, averted the disaster, and persuaded him not to argue. Wu Zitian endured it once more.

“A family established through harshness will not endure.”  Not many years after the division of property, the son of the stepmother developed a gambling addiction and squandered all of the family’s wealth. Tang also had no money left, and the mother and son were in dire straits, reduced to begging. Wu Zitian’s wife then advised her husband, “You should quickly bring your stepmother back to care for her.” Would you do the same? Or would you say, “Heaven has eyes! You're getting what you deserve!"? Frankly, regardless of what they did to him, they were still his brother and stepmother.  Being happy or gloating in their misfortune would only earn you the disdain of others. This wife quickly persuaded her husband to fulfill his duty as a son and brother. In truth, despite Tang and her son's terrible treatment of Wu Zitian, he put aside his grievances, took them in, cared for them, and awoke their conscience. In the end, his younger brother was able to overcome his gambling addiction.

Sun gave birth to three sons, all of whom passed the imperial examinations with high honors. One scholar from a family was a significant achievement, but imagine, she had three sons achieve such high honors! Such great future blessings! Therefore, people must learn to be willing to accept losses, and not be calculating. If you are calculating, you become harsh. If you become harsh, you’ll experience “disrupted family relations” and will have no good result. These stories teach us that man’s calculations are not as good as heaven’s calculations. Heaven is kind and does not hold grudges. That is truly heaven's calculation.

The sutra then goes on to say:
*[Brothers and uncles/nephews should divide property so that the rich share with the poor.  The relationships between elders and juniors, both within and outside the family, should be governed by the law, respectful in their language, and strict in behavior.]*

The word "brothers" doesn't refer only to those born of the same parents but also to cousins and relatives.  There should be a sense of shared wealth between relatives. When relatives are in great financial need, we should do our duty to help.  Also, between uncles and nephews, there should be no calculations of wealth. When sharing, relatives should receive more, and those relatives who are poorer, should receive more help. The word "share" also means to provide care and concern.

There was a scholar named Zhang Shixuan in ancient times, whose parents died early. His uncle raised him. His uncle had seven sons. Later, his uncle said to him, "The family inheritance will be split into two parts, one for you and one for me." However, Zhang Shixuan said, "Uncle, we should not divide it into two. It should be divided into eight parts, with all my cousins." He didn't care about the money at all. His uncle insisted, "You represent your father, and it should be divided into two." But he insisted even more, because he was remembering his uncle and aunt's kindness in raising him. Throughout the process of being raised, our bodies may become sick, difficult to care for. Our adoptive parents would have to worry a great deal about all of our needs – the necessities of life, education, and more. Therefore, the merit of raising a child is greater than that of giving birth.

Zhang Shixuan insisted and had the inheritance divided into eight parts. Later, when he went to the capital to take the imperial examinations, a fortune teller in the inn told him, "Your face is filled with the lines of hidden virtue, you will certainly achieve high official rank." How could someone so young accumulate so much hidden virtue? It was due to his "sharing with the poor," which earned him tremendous virtue, and he achieved the honor of a *Jinshi* degree at just seventeen years old.

What are these lines of hidden virtue? I’m not entirely sure, but we can imagine that if someone is always angry, their brow would be heavily furrowed, with vertical lines - these are not lines of good fortune, but lines of misfortune. However, if you never argue with people, and even when others are unreasonable with you, you smile, then that pattern of muscle activity, which is often smiling, will result in many fine lines on the forehead, which I believe could be related to "lines of hidden virtue." So, “nurturing a happy spirit is the foundation for attracting good fortune.” A home should be filled with joy, to welcome the God of Wealth. We should always smile. “Eliminating the desire to kill removes the source of disaster.” Of course, this not only means avoiding violence but also avoiding harshness, and avoiding anger. You will also invite misfortune. Therefore, if you want to accumulate merit and virtue, start by eliminating any signs of anger from your face. Before you leave tomorrow, take a look in the mirror; if you are frightened by your reflection, adjust your mood before going out.

When I see "Brothers and uncles/nephews should divide property so that the rich share with the poor," I think of my father. Frankly, if we don't help our cousins and other relatives, our parents feel very sad. If we, as cousins and relatives, are united, it's the best act of filial piety that we can show our elders, so that they feel comforted and relieved that the next generation are all united. This sense of obligation is actually derived from the moral example of our parents. My father cared for his grandparents and bore all of the unusual costs, for example, if they fell ill. Later, my uncles and aunts said, "You can't bear this alone, we must also contribute." So, because my father, as the elder brother, never cared for money, all of his siblings valued righteousness over profit. Our family has never had any conflicts over money. My grandfather, feeling that he wanted to give some inheritance to his children to make them happy, sold some land and wanted to divide the proceeds. The children respected his wishes. The five siblings were discussing it when my uncles and aunts said, "Lixu is the eldest grandson, he should receive a share." But my father said, "No, he doesn't need a share, he is of the next generation." If you were me, how would you feel? I was incredibly touched. My father never cared about money, he always thought of his brothers, so I admired him greatly.

Even on my mother's side of the family, where her brothers and sisters and the next generation were not as well off as we were, my father would help my cousins when he saw that they couldn’t pay their school fees. He didn’t wait for my mother to ask. Think about it, if my mother didn’t even have to ask, but my father acted on his own initiative, then my mother would surely be moved. If the wife is moved, then they’d be of one mind, even barren land can turn to gold. How can you argue about money all the time, leading to conflicts between couples?

Furthermore, because parents and elders “share with the poor” and help relatives and friends, their children, wherever they go, will receive love and care from others. This is what I have personally experienced. When I went to study or work away from home, my local relatives took care of me incredibly well. I didn't understand these principles before; I just thought I was very cute. Later, I learned that my parents had always helped relatives and friends, and those relatives remembered those acts of kindness and when their children came, of course, they would go out of their way to take care of them. Therefore, I have benefitted from the blessings left behind by my parents and grandparents. This not only accumulates blessings for our children, but also instills moral principles in them, which will benefit them throughout their lives. Because “those who love others are loved, and those who respect others are respected.” Those with a sense of righteousness receive love and respect wherever they go.

The next line says, *“The relationships between elders and juniors, both within and outside the family, should be governed by the law, respectful in their language, and strict in behavior.”* “Elders and juniors” refers to the order of seniority within the family. “Governed by the law” refers to strict family rules. “Respectful in their language” means that elders should speak with dignity and respect and not speak carelessly. This highlights the fact that to have a prosperous family, you must have good family rules.  Good family rules must be started by the elders and parents through their own example. For thousands of years, all parents and elders have had this attitude and sense of responsibility to set a good example for their children. Seeing this line, from today on, we should be careful and cautious in every word and action, to set a good precedent for our children. If we can do that, then we have not studied this line in vain, we have not studied *Zhu Zi's Maxims for Family Management* in vain, and we will have lived up to the teachings of Mr. Zhu Bailu.

Our time is up for today. I would like to thank you all for listening!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for a professional and accurate rendition:

**Lecture 11: Valuing Righteousness Over Profit Brings Blessings**

Respected elders, dear friends, hello everyone! Last time we discussed:

"Among siblings and relatives, those who have more should share with those who have less. In interactions between elders and juniors, and within and outside the family, proper manners and respectful speech should be observed."

Between brothers and sisters, uncles, nephews, and nieces, those who have more should willingly share with family members who have less. If siblings do not differentiate between their wealth and support each other, then the parents are the happiest. Similarly, if the entire family can help and support each other in times of need, then the grandparents, and even the ancestors, can rest assured. Being able to put one's parents and ancestors at ease is fundamental to being a good person. As the saying goes, "Older brothers should be friendly, younger brothers should be respectful. When brothers are harmonious, filial piety is present." Therefore, fulfilling filial piety must be expressed through the harmony and love between siblings.

Now, as we reflect on this, do we hesitate when our siblings truly need help? Do we waver, or do we act without reservation? There was an entrepreneur who frequently donated money to various organizations or to the poor. Once he had donated, he didn’t dwell on it. However, when he helped his own older sister and younger brother, he remembered the details very clearly. He reflected that his sense of obligation towards his siblings was lacking, and yet he was often praised as a philanthropist. He realized that his donations were done to gain recognition from others. So, his acts of kindness were mixed with a desire for fame, while true righteousness should be expressed through one's actions towards parents and siblings. Reflecting on this, he later said to his younger brother: “The money you borrowed before is forgiven. Brother will help you find a good place to live, so you can settle down.” His younger brother burst into tears right then and there. His mother, who had been constantly worried, was now able to smile, and this change made her very happy.

To be frank, do parents know if their children are harmonious with each other? Yes, they are very clear in their hearts. Sometimes, people lack the intention to be filial but comfort themselves, thinking, "I give the most money, so I am the most filial.” In reality, when we have money or gain status and become arrogant and rude towards our siblings and family members, that is what makes our parents feel the most ashamed. It is a source of great honor for parents when we go anywhere and our relatives praise and affirm us.

The first volume of the *Moral Education Textbook* discusses filial piety and brotherly love. Upon reading it, we feel a sense of shame because, compared to the sense of righteousness and responsibility that the ancients had towards their parents and siblings, we fall short. For instance, today we talk about "Among siblings and relatives, those who have more should share with those who have less,” and we’re talking only about financial matters. However, in ancient times, brothers could even sacrifice their lives for each other.

In the Han Dynasty, there were two brothers, Zhao Xiao and Zhao Li. Zhao Li, the younger brother, was captured by bandits. The older brother, Zhao Xiao, rushed to find his younger brother and offered to die in his place. The two brothers embraced and wept bitterly. If they could give their lives for each other, would they still haggle over money? This was not just the case for brothers but also for uncles and nephews. There was a scholar named Zhang Yi. His nephew, Zhang Cunren, was captured by bandits. Zhang Yi rushed to the bandits' den and, risking his own life, told the bandits, “This nephew of mine is the only male heir, and he is very young. I cannot let my brother be without descendants. If you want to kill someone, then kill me.” The bandits were touched by his genuine righteousness and changed their minds. The more we read such stories, the more ashamed we feel of haggling over money with our siblings and family members. This is what it means to "compare your virtue with those above and feel shame.” When we compare our virtue to that of the sages, we are easily filled with a sense of shame.

"Compare your virtue with those above and feel shame; compare your desires with those below and feel contentment.” When we compare our desire for indulgence to a lower standard of living, we become content, and contentment leads to lasting joy. A sense of shame leads to courage; we will constantly strive to improve our morality. If we want our children to take Confucius as an example, what should we do first? We must lead by example and demonstrate that we are striving to emulate the sages. Then our children will naturally follow suit.

This passage reminds us of the behavior of the ancients and also of our own ancestors. I am a descendant of King Wen of the Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou family practiced filial piety and brotherly love thoroughly. From the perspective of "fraternal respect" we can look at the example of King Ji, King Wen’s father. King Ji was the third-born of his three brothers. The eldest was Taibo and the second was Zhongyong. Logically, Taibo should have become the ruler, but he relinquished the position to his third brother. He saw that his father favored King Wen, his grandson, to succeed the throne. And in order to pass the throne to the grandson, it had to first go to King Ji (King Wen's father). The hearts of the ancients were very sensitive; they could sense their parents' feelings and would act on them even without being asked.

People have a soft heart, and they can all perceive the feelings of their parents. This is an innate ability. Our ancestors understood that "the affection between father and son" is a natural bond. Once, a four- or five-year-old child performed a kneeling bow to his father, expressing gratitude for his father's kindness. When the child began to cry profusely, I asked, "Child, why are you crying?" He immediately replied, "Because my father is crying." He felt his father's emotions and cried as a result. Esteemed elders, brothers, and sisters, when your parents cry, do you cry? I tell you, this innate ability must be restored; it is something we already possess. I was fortunate enough to have a partial restoration of this ability on the day my older sister got married. When my sister and her husband bowed three times and kowtowed nine times before my parents, my father's eyes filled with tears at the first bow. However, he had a way of managing tears where they would only well up in his eyes without falling down. I completely understood my father's feelings at that moment. From then on, I could understand everything that my father said. This is our innate ability. When my sister and her husband bowed, my father was likely thinking about how he had raised and nurtured his daughter for the past two or three decades, even during the times she misunderstood him and threw tantrums. He was probably thinking, "Today, I am gratified that I have finally found a responsible man to care for her."

I remember when I was going to Haikou, Hainan, my father gave me many words of advice, telling me, "If the circumstances don’t work out, come back quickly." Why did my father want me to come back quickly? He was afraid that, if I spent too many years there without achieving anything, I would become insecure. Parents are always thinking ahead. At that time, I was very touched by my father’s words; I went to Haikou carrying his deep love. Rather than saying, "Dad, don't worry, 'Heaven favors the virtuous,' and I have the protection of our ancestors, so you don't need to worry," I said to him clearly, "Dad, don't worry, if it doesn't work out, I will come back immediately." Because I understood his feelings.

After spending four or five months there, I went home for the New Year. When I walked through the door, after not seeing my father for so long, I immediately began to share what had been happening, telling him about how so many children had changed after listening to lectures on filial piety and were now being filial to their parents. My father was moved to tears three times. Afterwards, when I returned to Haikou and called home for the first time, my father said, "Leave everything at home to me. You can rest assured and focus on what you are doing there." He understood what we were doing, and so he was no longer worried and gave us his full support. So, we must rediscover our innate abilities. It is wonderful to be able to have open and honest conversations with our parents.

Taibo, sensing his father's feelings, voluntarily left his country and gave the throne to his younger brother. If he could give up the throne, could he not give up money? Interestingly, though Taibo gave up his right to be the ruler, he later went to the Jiangsu area, and his virtue so moved the people there that they supported him as their ruler. So, he became a ruler again. "If it is meant to be, it will be." He had the virtue and blessings, so he could not escape his destiny. Therefore, future generations of the Zhou Dynasty could often recall the conduct of their ancestors, which provided them with good encouragement. So, if you have disagreements with your family, quickly take out the *Moral Education Textbook* and have a look. Upon comparing ourselves, we’ll feel embarrassed.

The ancients left behind a beautiful poem that speaks about the relationship between brothers: “We are all branches from the same life source, each flourishing.” Which life source? Our parents are our roots; we are all branches growing from those roots. As long as brothers are not in harmony, the roots will suffer. “Do not let minor words hurt feelings.” We are all part of one body; we should not cause disharmony over trivial matters. “Each time we meet, we are that much older, how long can we be brothers?” Reading this now, I feel it very deeply because I have recently found a few gray hairs. My older sister is several years older than me. We each have our own families, and have developed our own careers. Sometimes, we only see each other once every few months. It is true that “each time we meet, we are that much older.” “How long can we be brothers?” Life is very short. What is the happiest way to live? A life lived with gratitude. Time passes too quickly. I am forty years old this year. I can still clearly recall playing with my older sister when I was a child, even though it has already been twenty or thirty years since then. Time goes by very fast! So, “how long can we be brothers?”

During the Tang Dynasty, Li Ji became a high-ranking official of the state. The emperor bestowed upon him the surname "Li," giving him a very high status. When his older sister became ill, he went to visit her and personally cooked porridge for her. His long beard accidentally caught fire while cooking, and his sister said, “Younger brother, why must you go to so much trouble? You have so many servants; you could have them do it. Why do you do it yourself?” He said, “Sister, you don't understand. We are both old now; how many more chances will I have to personally cook porridge for you?”

Speaking of this, I feel like I am not a good younger brother. My older sister has taken care of me too much. When I was in university, I was not in good health, and my older sister boiled medicine for me every day, which took two hours. Once it was ready, she had to carry it into the campus from outside the gate. The male dormitories were located on the far side of the school, so she had to walk a long way. She would walk and walk and reach the outside of the dormitory, where she was not allowed to enter, so she would knock at the window. When I couldn't hear, I would read her lips and would know, “Hurry up and come out to get your medicine.” That was how things were for several months. Thinking about that, I have been away from home for so many years. I have not shown enough concern for my sister's family or her children. “How long can we be brothers?”

"If brothers live together with tolerance, they will be at peace. Do not let minor matters lead to conflict.” There was a scholar named Zhou Wencan. His older brother depended on him for financial support, and he was responsible for taking care of his brother and providing him with everything he needed. However, one day, his brother got drunk and hit him. The neighbors could not stand it anymore and cursed his older brother. Zhou Wencan immediately stopped them, saying, “You must not disrupt the brotherly feelings between us.” These were the words of a person with profound righteousness. Though he had been hit by his brother, he did not harbor any resentment. He only thought of the bond he shared with his brother. I believe that at that moment, those who were trying to mediate were moved!

Now, let's think about how this scenario might play out. When the brother sobers up, would he hear the neighbors saying, "How can there be such a younger brother? His older brother eats his food, uses his things, and even hits him. When people criticize his brother, he immediately refutes them and does not want others to criticize him?” People have a conscience, and the brother would be touched by this after one or two instances of this.

The ancients, when it came to family relationships, did not dwell on the faults of their parents; they believed “there are no parents in this world who are not right.” Nor did they focus on the faults of their siblings or relatives. Instead, they only thought about the obligations that they should fulfill. This is truly admirable. If Zhou Wencan had held even one of his brother’s faults in his heart, he would not have been able to act with such profound righteousness. If he had held resentment in his heart, he would have said to the neighbors when they were about to curse his brother: “Heaven has eyes, and finally someone is here to help me!” Therefore, we should not allow our feelings of righteousness to become tainted; then, naturally, "sincerity can move even metal and stone." Our actions will move our family members.

During the Ming Dynasty, there were two brothers, Zhao Yanyun and Zhao Yanxiao. The older brother, Zhao Yanyun, was irresponsible and valued luxury and enjoyment. It was clear that the family fortune would be squandered by the older brother, so the younger brother, Zhao Yanxiao, proposed that they split the family assets. Is splitting the family assets a good thing? No, it is not. Then why would Zhao Yanxiao, who studied the classics, propose this?

Looking at this example, we can see that he understood the importance of adaptability. It is a principle that brothers should not divide family assets. However, seeing his older brother acting in this manner, he knew that it was acceptable to be adaptable in order to preserve the family's assets; he was not being greedy. Five years later, his older brother was in severe debt and had no place to call home. On New Year's Eve, Zhao Yanxiao and his wife prepared a grand feast and invited his older brother and his sister-in-law to join them. After the meal, he told his older brother and his sister-in-law, "Splitting the family in the past was something we were forced to do in order to protect the family's assets. Now, I will give the house, all of our family assets, and the keys to the storeroom to my sister-in-law to manage. From today onward, we will all live together again.” In such circumstances, the older brother had a conscience and was reflecting on his actions. The younger brother’s forgiveness, and the fact that he was entrusting the family affairs to his older brother, awakened his conscience. So, his older brother and sister-in-law changed their ways.

As a woman, if your husband did this, would you be willing to give up everything? To give the keys to someone else? Only by giving, can we receive. We must give up material benefits and value righteousness. In the end, both Zhao Yanxiao and his son passed the imperial examinations and earned their *jinshi* titles that year because of the great virtue they had accumulated. Filial piety and fraternal respect are blessings and fields of merit; they are where people can cultivate great blessings. These are cultivated when we are filial to our parents and respectful to our elders and siblings. In the end, life is never a loss.

As mentioned earlier, “If brothers live together with tolerance, they will be at peace. Do not let minor matters lead to conflict.” We must never hold the faults of our siblings or relatives in our hearts. “The children we have today will one day be brothers and sisters; let us give them a good example.” The children that brothers and sisters have today will become cousins. What kind of example are we giving to them? “In interactions between elders and juniors, and within and outside the family, proper manners and respectful speech should be observed.” It is the responsibility of elders to set a good example for the next generation.

There was a family surnamed Chen. Chen Fang’s family had not divided their household for thirteen generations, and they had lived together for several hundred years. Their whole family would not begin eating until everyone was present. What was the outcome? Their family had approximately one hundred dogs, and they were so touched by this family’s harmony that the dogs would not eat until all one hundred dogs were present. Thus, fraternal respect was so effectively carried out that even the dogs were moved and followed their example of unity and courtesy. Therefore, "let us give them a good example" should be the attitude of every parent and elder.

So, the phrase "In interactions between elders and juniors, and within and outside the family, proper manners and respectful speech should be observed" reminds us that the establishment of family traditions and rules must begin with the parents and elders. "Elders and juniors, within and outside," refers to the old and young members of the family, and those both inside and outside the home. Men, who are mainly responsible for external matters, and women, who are primarily responsible for the internal matters of the household, should all follow strict rules. This is what "proper manners" mean. "Respectful speech" means that our language must be very dignified; we should not often make jokes, engage in horseplay, or say frivolous things. Then a person will be more stable. There are some parents today who are not good examples, and they are also influenced by variety shows. Haven’t you noticed that not many young people speak with composure? "A gentleman who lacks seriousness will lack authority.” If a person lacks seriousness, they will lack authority, and without authority they cannot respect themselves. How can others respect them? Therefore, if a person frequently makes jokes, others will get confused and will wonder which of his words are genuine.

Therefore, “proper manners and respectful speech” are necessary. If a family is to prosper, this must begin with the enforcement of strict family rules. If family rules are not strictly enforced, the children will behave recklessly. Especially with a strict father and a gentle mother, women tend to be more compliant while men tend to be more assertive. There’s a problem now that fathers lack authority, as they try to please their children. They will buy them everything they ask for, and men tend to take on the role of the "white face." This means that the woman has to take on the role of the "black face," and she has to treat the children very harshly. I once heard a mother cry after she had finished scolding her child. It is truly difficult for women today. They have to carry the responsibility, take care of the children, and be harsh with them; otherwise, the children will be reckless. And the husband doesn't help. In such a situation, they have to play the role of both man and woman; the yin and yang are out of balance, and it is difficult not to develop a hormonal imbalance. Therefore, men must act like men, and women must act like women.

The other day, while riding in an elevator, as the doors closed, I saw a painting: a father was letting his daughter sit on his head. If a child has been sitting on her father's head since she was young, will she fear her father? If we were to review 5,000 years of history, there has never been anything like this. Today, people see others do this, and they are envious. They immediately lift their own children onto their heads. People are ignorant and pitiful. They admire these incorrect behaviors. If they don't do it, it seems like they are not keeping up with the trend. Think about it: during our childhood, when we saw our father, we would immediately behave properly. If we were engaging in behavior that was slightly inappropriate, we would immediately stop at the first cough from our father. How would we dare to be reckless? Therefore, the practice of a strict father and a gentle mother is very sound.

My analysis of this is based on classical texts. There is a hexagram in the *Book of Changes* called the “Family” hexagram. Our ancestors left us instructions on how to properly manage a family. The “Family” hexagram says, “The family has an authoritative leader; these are the parents." A family needs a leader who is very authoritative. Who is that? It is the parents. Furthermore, it mentions, "Words have substance, and actions are consistent." Parents are very strict leaders. They are aware that their words and actions are subtly influencing their children, and they have the sense of awareness to be very careful. Their words are not frivolous, they don't joke around carelessly, and what they say is truthful and honest.

There was a movie called "Cell Phone" which stated that adults tell lies twenty-some times per day. If we do not improve this, how can we teach our children? How can we teach them to be honest? How was Sima Guang able to “live his life without doing anything he would be ashamed to tell people?” It was because, when he told his first lie as a child, his father sternly stopped him, and from then on, he dared not act improperly. There must have been a father who set a worthy example to produce a sage who was so perfect in character. And naturally, his father’s language was all about righteousness and not about self-interest. Many parents today only talk about money and wealth. They seldom talk about the righteousness between siblings, family members, and friends.

In my memory, my father became a bank manager very early in his career, but he never talked to us about business or money. So, my three siblings and I have a very detached view of money. We have never been concerned about finances with our classmates and friends. That is the result of our parents' conduct. My father often said, “Don’t envy those wealthy people who drive big cars. They are actually often speeding because they have to get to the bank before it closes to pay their checks; otherwise, they will lose their credit." They are always very stressed and under a lot of pressure.

Why is it that our generation values profit and enjoyment so much? It is because our parents’ generation did not talk enough about righteousness. But we cannot blame them. For example, when our children’s generation goes to work, what is the first thing that we, as parents and elders, are concerned about? “How much is the monthly salary?” Is there any passage in the classical texts where parents and elders, knowing that their child was about to become an official or engage in some other career, would ask how much money they would earn every month? There has never been such a question in the last 5,000 years. However, today, nearly half of all parents will ask this question. So, while we blame the next generation for valuing profit over righteousness, the source is actually with us. We cannot blame them.

I remember when I was a child, I would hear the older brothers and sisters filling out their college applications and would often hear them say: “Which major will earn the most money?” That was the focus. I don’t remember hearing anyone say, “Which industry can help the most people?” If I were to suddenly hear someone, among my relatives and friends, ask that question, it would be like hearing the beautiful sound of angels coming down from heaven. It is a sound that is a bit out of place in this day and age; it is not often that we hear such a beautiful sound. So many people, once exposed to today's materialistic society, take so-called advanced countries as their fathers and look down on their own parents and on the culture of their ancestors. This is what it means to "behave in a servile manner when meeting the rich and powerful; this is the most shameful behavior.” They admire those who live luxurious lives, and they deny the humble lifestyle of their parents and ancestors, calling them old-fashioned. In reality, if we were all to follow the lifestyle of the so-called advanced countries, ten Earths would not be enough. That is the wrong way to live.

So, "words have substance." Our language should be in accordance with righteousness, kinship, and gratitude. Otherwise, we will misguide our children's life values. If their values become skewed, it will be impossible for them to have a happy life. There are far too many people in our society today who have distorted values. That is why there are more and more cases of depression, the suicide rate and divorce rate are so high, and there are so many family problems. These are all the results of warped ideas. Therefore, our words, actions, and ideas should all serve as an example for our children.

As mentioned earlier, "proper manners and respectful speech." "Proper manners" refers to family rules. How we stand, how we sit—our entire demeanor must be proper. Think about it: when we were children, wasn’t our grandmother always dressed in a dignified manner? She was very dignified.


Okay, here's the English translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural flow, suitable for a book:

**Book Title Suggestion (based on content): Cultivating Respect, Revering Tradition: A Guide to Family Harmony**

**Translation:**

My grandmother always dressed with such dignity. My uncles, father, and granduncles were all utterly respectful in her presence. Just thinking of her imposing presence inspires a sense of awe. Yet, my mother now dresses so casually at home. How can our children respect us? If we dress so casually, what will our daughters wear in the future? They will be even more careless. It takes a lifetime to learn good habits, but only a day to learn bad ones.

We mustn't underestimate a woman's attire. It directly affects the stability of the world, it's not an exaggeration at all. When women dress provocatively, divorce rates and crime rates will absolutely rise in tandem. People's hearts, especially men's, are fickle. Evil thoughts increase. And now advertisements are constantly displaying those kinds of things. So, it’s difficult to be a gentleman in this era. You might walk into a lamppost because it’s hard not to look around.

“It takes more than one cold day to freeze three feet of ice.” Fellow compatriots, the revolution is not yet complete, comrades must continue to strive. In this day and age, to reverse these erroneous ideas and restore order, it will take the persistent efforts of generations, passing these values down. So, it makes me very happy to see so many children learning traditional culture from a young age. Their future achievements will be far greater than ours, because we only began to learn with difficulty as adults. By adulthood, so many bad habits have already been formed. To change these habits, you don't just need to "peel off" the skin. You need to cut open the skin, peel back the flesh, and then penetrate into the bone marrow to extract it, because these habits have been buried so deeply for decades. Although it is painful, it is better to experience brief pain than chronic pain. Once you truly put in the effort, you will no longer be controlled by these habits, and you will feel free in body and mind.

In fact, family rules, even in the smallest of details, can remind children. For example, when a child sees a food they like, they might eat it all eagerly. A mother who knows how to teach will remind and stop them, “If your desires are so strong when you’re just eating, won’t you be controlled by desires in the future? You’ve eaten so much, now there’s nothing left for others.” Some parents don't understand, "If he likes to eat it, let him have more!" By spoiling the child in this way, their desires will only grow stronger and stronger.

Another example, when a child falls, some mothers might hit the ground. As the child grows older, they will think, “Why did I fall? It’s the ground’s fault.” They were careless when walking, and yet they hit the ground. The earth has endured so much injustice, hasn't it? Every day it nourishes all living things, yet we don't feel gratitude. Instead, we push all responsibility onto it.

Hou Shi, the mother of the two great Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty, Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi, grasped every detail of life to educate her children. Her husband was a high official and there were servants in the house. If her children spoke to a servant with even the slightest air of arrogance, she would immediately scold them: “We are all human beings. He is even older than you, how can you speak to him like that?” She didn’t encourage their arrogance. It's so easy for rich families to become arrogant and look down on others. Therefore, educating children in wealth is not easy without wisdom, and especially without the love of vanity. You must be respectful towards all people, events, and objects. If you are wealthy, but live frugally, then you are doing it right.

These rules must be practiced, and rules cannot be separated from ethics. The relationship between parents and children is all about ethical rules. “Morning greetings and evening settling” is one such rule. Do we have “morning greetings and evening settling” in our homes now? Do our children understand what these mean? Once we understand these principles, we must put them into practice so that we and our families can benefit. If we learn them but don't practice them for ten years, we won’t benefit. So, if we truly want to benefit, once we understand a principle, we must make that principle part of our family rules and family values. “Learning is like rowing upstream; if you do not advance, you will retreat.” When children don’t understand “morning greetings and evening settling,” their filial piety diminishes daily. How could a university student who is rude and indifferent to their parents have become this way in just one day? How could a child who has practiced morning and evening greetings from childhood ever become like this?

There was an elementary school teacher who had taught all his life. He recalled how every morning his father would respectfully greet his grandmother, accompanied by his wife. It seems that in Chinese society today, it's rare for a wife to accompany her husband to greet his parents. Chinese culture is hanging by a thread, in grave danger. If we don’t put these principles into daily practice, this culture will gradually cease to exist.

I was once moved by a story I heard. A Chinese man married a Japanese woman. Every day, the woman would dress very formally, kneel at the door of her in-laws, waiting to greet them with respect. The Japanese do this, but we Chinese no longer do.

If we take a moment to think about it: who do we Chinese resemble now? Do we resemble our ancestors? Or do we resemble these so-called “civilized, developed countries” of the West? "Civilized and developed" in quotation marks, why? Because they have more advanced technology, but they are not more civilized. The more virtuous people become, the more civilized a society becomes. With the high rates of abortion and divorce, how can we call it a civilized society? Abortion is something that even animals wouldn’t do, yet it is so prevalent in so-called civilized societies. There are 50 million abortions worldwide each year, and the proportion in so-called civilized societies is definitely the highest. These things are rare in more simple places where people don't earn much money. So, if we don’t stop and think, we can be misled by many things in this era, failing to see the real problems, and even learning things that are wrong without even realizing it.

Earlier, we spoke about the teacher’s father. After greeting his mother, he would bring her water for washing her face, and then a grown man would take his mother's chamber pot to clean it quickly. The teacher’s deepest impression of his father was the careful way he cleaned his grandmother’s chamber pot. He would wash it several times and then do one particular thing – he’d lift the pot to smell it. His mother liked things clean, and he wanted to make sure there was no odor before bringing it back. So, this act of smelling the pot showed the meticulous care he took of his mother, and it became part of his family tradition, a “consistent practice.” How long did his father do this? Since the teacher was a child, he had seen his father do this for years, not as a show for others. So, a home where everything is clean and tidy, where clothes and hats are placed in their proper positions, and where rooms are clean and the walls are spotless—this child will surely live a life of order and regularity, not chaos.

Some parents today don't realize that "consistent practice" is needed to teach children well, and they teach them in flawed ways. For example, when guests are about to arrive, the whole house is thrown into a frenzy of cleaning, like a war zone. What does the child learn from this? “We only clean when guests are coming?” It’s all just a show, just for appearances. So, the child learns to be insincere and dishonest. Later, when they greet guests, they will say, "Welcome!" And then as soon as the guest turns away, "Hmph!" This kind of thing is very common now. People are one way in front of others, and another way behind their backs. Or even worse, before you even walk away, they’ll make a face at you. They’re welcoming and enthusiastic while they try to sell you something. But the moment you don't buy, their faces turn sour. They are disrespectful and insincere. This is why we need to set a genuine example of these things for our children within the home.

In institutions like schools, when supervisors are coming for an inspection, the school will rush to produce lots of materials in the three days before, putting on a big display of achievements. The printers are running constantly. And then, as soon as the inspection is over, everything is put away that very day. What do the children at the school learn from this? “We only need to do things when there is an inspection, otherwise we can slack off.”

So, from home to school, no one does anything genuinely, everyone just puts on a show when there is a situation. If this becomes the norm, what kind of people will we raise for the next generation? The truth is, a life that is all about putting on a show leaves people feeling insecure with each other. If people live truthfully and sincerely, and when they say one thing, they mean one thing, then people will feel secure and trustworthy with each other. This is “for all ages, for all situations, use words and rules strictly."

Next, let's look at the next line:

**[Listening to a woman, disrupting family bonds; how can this be a real man?  Valuing wealth, neglecting parents, not worthy of being called a child.]**

Listening to the words of a woman, a wife, and allowing them to sow discord, one damages the bonds of kinship. The bonds between fathers and sons, brothers, are those of flesh and blood. So, how can that person be considered a true man? A true man should be reasonable and have good judgment; he shouldn't easily be influenced by words meant to sow discord.

"Listening to a woman’s words" - we all say that pillow talk is very powerful, often influencing people with just a few words. Men often say that women like to hear sweet talk, but don't men also like to hear sweet talk? Do we prefer to listen to our parents, or do we prefer to listen to compliments and flattery? “Honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but benefits conduct.” Of course, a wise woman will often use these important principles to remind her husband. There’s a saying, “A virtuous wife means fewer misfortunes for her husband.” A virtuous wife can help her husband overcome many calamities and misfortunes.

Let's think about it calmly: why are a man and a son so easily influenced by a woman’s words? Firstly, they do not hold their parents’ kindness in their hearts. For those who remember the kindness they received, words of slander and discord won’t easily enter. So, what should people do? Remember kindness and forget grievances. “Gratitude should be repaid, grudges should be forgotten.”

If a person remembers kindness and forgets grievances, you can see it in their face. The forehead and between their eyebrows will shine brightly, meaning that they are not holding onto grudges. If they look a little dark and dull, and when they hear the phrase "Gratitude should be repaid, grudges should be forgotten," they feel a bit unwilling, then they’re unable to accept it. The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* is our innate virtue, so why is it so difficult and forced now? Because we have followed bad habits for too long, and violated our innate virtue for too long. It's because we have taken a life of ease for granted for too long. We are tormenting ourselves. If people immediately let go of grievances, won’t peace come? So, people often ask for suffering, invite hardship upon themselves. If they truly try to release their anger, they can live harmoniously with everyone.

Therefore, we should always think of the kindness of our parents. “The kindness of guarding during pregnancy”, especially the hardship of mothers during the ten months of pregnancy. “The kindness of suffering during childbirth.”  The pain of childbirth can last for several hours, sometimes even two or three days. One mother was in pain for two days and still couldn't give birth. In the end, she had to have a c-section. They couldn’t give her too much anesthesia for fear of harming the child, so she could clearly feel the pain as they cut her open. This is “the kindness of suffering during childbirth.”

“The kindness of forgetting worry after giving birth.” As soon as the mother gives birth to us, her entire focus shifts to our health and safety, and she immediately forgets her pain. So, this thought is pure, genuine love, which cannot be repaid by wealth, but only by true filial piety. So, just with this one thought, we could never repay her kindness.

“The kindness of moving us to a dry place.” When we were young, if we wet the bed or soiled ourselves, our parents would immediately move us to a dry place and sleep in the wet spot themselves.

“The kindness of nurturing with breast milk.” I once heard a friend say that his mother breastfed him for over three years, and he had a very good and healthy constitution. Breast milk is formed from the mother’s blood. The director Zhai Junjie sealed up his wife’s breast milk and prepared to give it to his daughter when she got married. But when he took it out before her wedding, the small bottle of milk had long since turned into blood. It’s true that breast milk is formed from the mother’s blood. This is a very meaningful wedding gift, to let his daughter carry this with her and never forget her mother's nurturing kindness.

“The kindness of washing away dirt.” A colleague of mine who is a mother has to wash many pairs of pants and clothes every day, and she never complains about her children’s mess. I even heard a mother say that her child’s digestive system wasn’t very good, so she paid close attention to what her child ate, and kept a careful watch on his bowel movements. She once said that she felt relieved when she saw that his bowel movements were good. She also said, “Strangely enough, my child’s bowel movements don’t smell bad, they even smell a little sweet.” Although I thought that was a little exaggerated, I was not surprised, because her entire focus was on whether her child was healthy, and so she was happy to see that her child’s digestive system was doing well. Sometimes when I hear stories like this, I think of the many details of how our mothers nurtured us, and I realize that they truly have put in tremendous effort. And so, when we think about it often, it's natural to feel great love for our mothers, because it seems that we could never repay them.

“The kindness of thinking of us when we are far away.” As soon as we leave home, our parents worry and care for us, and often call us. So, when we are away from home, whether studying or starting a family, if our parents are always the ones calling us, then we are failing. It should be us who should be taking the initiative to call our parents. Because if our parents have to call, they have probably been worrying for days, and only call when they can’t hold back any longer. When learning the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, we must first put these things that filial children should do into practice.

“The kindness of deeply caring and understanding.” We feel this especially deeply as we grow up. For example, if we become seriously ill, and we cannot eat or sleep well, many parents will go before gods and Buddha’s statues, praying to take our suffering and sickness upon themselves. Because seeing their children in such suffering makes them feel even more pain.

“The kindness of ultimately showing compassion”. "Ultimately" means “even when mothers are one hundred years old, they still worry about their eighty-year-old children.” Even though a mother is one hundred years old, she still sees her eighty-year-old son as a child. Actually, her son is also an old person, at eighty years old. The ultimate showing of compassion, cherishing and caring for children. This is what it means to constantly think of the kindness of our parents.

There is a saying, "There are no parents in the world who are wrong.” Parents are not saints and sages, and they are sure to make mistakes, but we must not hold these in our hearts. We should always be thinking of how to fulfill our duties as children, and how to remind our parents to correct their faults. Therefore, “When parents have faults, advise them to change, do so with a cheerful look, and a gentle tone.” We can’t listen to words of slander and discord if we feel gratitude. Moreover, we must remind our partners to also understand the importance of filial piety. This is what “leading your wife towards enlightenment, helping your husband to achieve virtue” means; it is the most meaningful thing that can happen within a marriage, that both partners grow in virtue and spirituality.

The ancients recorded a true story. There was a man named Liu Jiande. His wife was very fierce, and when his mother became ill, his wife insisted on sending his mother to a nunnery. His wife was so fierce that he shrank back, and didn’t dare to say anything. So he sent his mother away, and his mother died in sadness and resentment. That was “listening to a woman, disrupting family bonds, how can this be a real man?” Before his mother died, she said in anger, "If I see King Yama, I will definitely file a complaint, I want King Yama to punish them for their lack of filial piety." A few days after his mother died, his wife fell ill, and went kind of crazy. She would talk to herself, saying that she was so wrong, how could she have treated her mother-in-law like that? And then her whole body turned purple and she died. Two days later, her husband, Liu Jiande, suddenly became ill, and he told everyone that he had been disobedient to his mother because he had listened to his wife. This was a grave act of filial impiety. And then he died too. When the couple was put in their coffins and before they were buried, suddenly a thunder storm came and split their coffins open. The stench was so bad that it could be smelled from miles away.

Since childhood, we’ve heard that those who are not filial to their parents will be struck by lightning. This is not just a meaningless saying, but is a real phenomenon we see throughout history. Have you noticed that more and more people seem to be dying by lightning strikes now? It’s not a coincidence, because there are too many people who are not filial these days. The *Classic of Filial Piety* says, “There were five forms of punishment, subdivided into three thousand.” In ancient times, there were five forms of punishment, which were divided into three thousand types. And what was the most serious? "There is no sin greater than filial impiety." The crime of filial impiety is the most serious between heaven and earth. This story reminds us that we must not do anything that would be considered filial impiety.

Therefore, a husband must be rational, and a wife must know that her responsibility is to "help her husband achieve virtue.” Husband and wife must work together to fulfill their duties of filial piety. If they do so, their family traditions will be passed on. “Having an elder in the family is like having a treasure.” Parents are the greatest source of blessings in a family, and we must respectfully serve and care for them.

Alright, that’s all I will share with you today. Thank you all!

Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional and accurate rendering from Chinese to English:

**Lecture 12: Grasping the Fundamentals of Being Human**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! The *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* is a very quintessential work of family instruction. Every single sentence is crucial to the rise and fall of a family. We can clearly see where the problems with families in this era lie.

Like the sentence we discussed earlier, “A family built on harshness will not enjoy lasting prosperity.” Heaven has a virtue of cherishing life, so how can harshness bring blessings? "If ethical relationships are disrupted, ruin will quickly follow." Harmony at home leads to the flourishing of all things. Conflicts between father and son, or between brothers, will lead to the downfall of the family. "Brothers, uncles, and nephews should share their wealth, giving more to those with less." Relatives should treat material possessions lightly, and value affection and righteousness. Especially when relatives are in dire financial need, we must quickly support them. "In interactions between elders and juniors, and within the family and without, one should be respectful and maintain strict standards." Just as a country has laws, so should a family have rules. Without rules, chaos will ensue. Therefore, so many problems with teenagers and the high crime rate are due to the lack of proper moral education from childhood. This is why we are seeing these issues arise.

There is an idiom that deserves reflection by people of this era: “Putting the cart before the horse.” Nowadays, people’s hard work is no less than that of the ancients. We spend much more time on family and work than they did. Some people may work ten hours a day and still worry a lot about their children. In the past five thousand years, we are the generation that spends the most time on teaching children and earning money. But if we think about it calmly, hard work does not necessarily guarantee a good outcome. Many people work hard now but may not earn money or raise their children well, which is very frustrating. This leads to more and more people suffering from depression, and even suicide rates are reaching concerning levels. Every forty seconds, someone in the world commits suicide. How is it that so much effort is yielding increasingly poor results? It comes down to a misconception between the “root” and the “branch,” putting the cart before the horse.

What is the “root” and the “branch” of life? With a tree, if we care for the root by fertilizing and watering it, all of its branches will grow well. However, nowadays people disregard the root and only focus on the branches, pouring water onto the leaves. Won’t that just rot the leaves? We must start with the root. In fact, every sentence in this family instruction teaches us about the root. It tells us that a kind and compassionate heart is the root of blessings. It tells us that family harmony is the root, and family education is the root. Then this next sentence tells us, “Filial piety is the foundation of a well-ordered family.” This is identifying the root. Without identifying the root, many of our efforts will be in vain.

Last time we talked about:

[If one listens to a wife, causing discord among family, can he be called a man?]

A man who listens to his unreasonable wife, shows disrespect to his parents, or causes conflict with his brothers is not worthy of being called a man. A true man should stand tall and understand the principles of being human. That is what makes him a man. Furthermore, a man should be someone that others can rely on. If a man doesn't even understand basic principles, how can he be a reliable husband or father? The first thing that a man should understand is the fundamental principle of being human. *The Classic of Filial Piety* highlights this point: “Filial piety is the root of virtue and the source of all teachings.” All teachings, whether it be family education, school education, or social education, should grasp the foundation of filial piety.

"Parents are the origin of being a child." The parent is the origin of children. “Origin” is the fundamental source. Without roots, how can there be branches? Without parents, where would we be? “Origin” is the source, the spring. Just as a spring gushes forth continuously, the river continues to flow. Remember the source of the water you drink, and know to repay the kindness. Only by protecting the root can the branches and leaves flourish. Only by being filial to parents will a family’s descendants be prosperous. And if a man, "listens to a wife, causing discord among family, can he be called a man?" A man should understand that today he is establishing a family, and the root of the family is filial piety. He should lead his wife in this filial duty. Spouses should together fulfill their responsibilities as children and together achieve moral excellence. This is the responsibility of a husband, to lead his wife towards the path of virtue.

The *Book of Odes* speaks of a woman’s wedding, “The peach tree is so young, its leaves are so lush. When this girl marries, she will harmonize with her family.” Therefore, a woman’s wedding is called "the joy of returning.” The poem describes a young woman, upon seeing a flourishing peach tree, expressing her intention to be filial to her in-laws after marriage and to bring prosperity to her new family, just like the peach tree. Thus, a woman’s original intention upon marriage is to assist her husband and bring prosperity to the family. Does anyone get married with the goal of turning the family upside down? It’s impossible. Therefore, it's very important for people not to forget their original intention.

"If one listens to a wife, causing discord among family," Firstly, a woman should treat her husband's parents and relatives as her own. Because if she loves her husband, shouldn't she be grateful to his parents for raising him? With this feeling of gratitude towards her in-laws, fulfilling filial piety will not be difficult. This also includes her husband’s siblings and elders, all of whom played a role in his upbringing. Spouses are one unit, and they should all show respect and filial piety. Once this principle is clear, there won’t be any feelings of separation just because her husband's family is not related by blood.

One’s perspective should be broad. Don’t just focus on immediate, petty gains. One should value righteousness. If we are filial to our parents and unite with our husband's siblings, we set a good example for our children. If we, as a couple, demonstrate filial piety and fraternal love, the next generation will definitely carry on this tradition. Don’t just focus on money. Don’t be calculative about caring for parents or helping siblings, because this could lead to the next generation becoming heartless and ungrateful, causing many problems.

In history, Emperor Shun, who we admire for his filial piety, had descendants that prospered for three or four thousand years, and there are still many of them today. Therefore, his descendants have a responsibility to pass on the tradition of filial piety. The surnames of Gu Yue Hu, Er Dong Chen, Tian, Yao, Yu, and Fu are all descendants of Emperor Shun. More importantly, they should carry on Shun’s filial and saintly virtues, so as not to let down their ancestors.

Looking at the world, the Chinese nation is the only one with a culture and history that has survived. This is not by chance. “A family that accumulates good deeds will have abundant blessings." This is because the core of Chinese virtue is filial piety. The Chinese culture is represented by a single character: *xiao* (孝), which means filial piety. The character consists of an older person at the top and a child at the bottom; they cannot be separated. The child is below, carrying the parents on their back, always thinking about how to repay their kindness. The parents are above, guiding the child with their life wisdom, always thinking about their children’s well-being.

Our ancestors thought about the future of their descendants. They wished that their descendants would use the wisdom they had accumulated over thousands of years to live happy lives. That's why they developed classical Chinese. If speech and writing were the same, language would change every thirty years, and dramatically every three hundred. If writing were the same as speech, we wouldn't be able to understand the writings of people from three hundred years ago, let alone the last five thousand years of our culture. Therefore, our ancestors had the great wisdom to think of future generations and invented classical Chinese. If we are proficient in fifty classical Chinese texts, we can understand classical Chinese. By opening the *Analects*, we can learn directly from Confucius, transcending the limits of time and space by two thousand five hundred years. Therefore, Chinese people are very fortunate to have such kind and wise ancestors. If we are willing to learn, we can all build our lives upon five thousand years of wisdom.

Thus, if we understand the kindness of our parents and ancestors, we wouldn't bear to let them down, or even worry them. Nowadays, Chinese people have lost the teachings of their ancestors. Therefore, they do not understand filial piety and how to behave properly, leading to frequent chaos. *Zuo Zhuan* says, "If people abandon the norm, then the abnormal will arise.” “Abandoning the norm” means deviating from the correct way of being human. “Abnormal” means that improper, upside-down situations will arise, just as the scriptures say: "If one listens to a wife, causing discord among family, can he be called a man? If one values wealth and neglects parents, he is not worthy of being called a son.” These are all deviations from the norm.

Furthermore, "When seeking a husband for your daughter, do not demand lavish dowry.” When seeking to organize a family, what should be the foundation? Virtue. “Virtue is the foundation, and wealth is the branch.” However, nowadays, whether it’s finding a partner or finding a job, people put money first. This is putting the cart before the horse. This is "abandoning the norm" and is why divorce rates are so high. There are many examples of inverting the root and the branch. For example, with filial piety, a filial son is one who is filial to his parents. Nowadays, it's the parents who are filial to their sons and daughters, taking care of them hand and foot. Today’s parents don’t understand the principle, "Loving without guidance is enough to harm them."

Some high school students cannot wake up in the morning, and their parents have to call them. They bring them water to wash their face, then prepare breakfast for them. After they are served, they are sent off to school. How much fortune does a high school student have to be treated like this? Maybe the parents are thinking: “It’s okay, as long as he gets into a good university.” Is there any logic to this? If you spoil them like this, will he be filial to you in the future? You have not taught him filial piety but instead have inverted the process by serving him, and he will think that all this is deserved. So, think calmly, how many filial sons can you find today?

Recently, I heard about an incident in my hometown. A doctoral student, whose parents spent a lot of time helping him study and raised him to become a Ph.D, got a very good job, got married, and had children which his parents helped take care of. However, when the two elderly parents became ill, he sent them to a nursing home, and had nothing to do with them. This is heartbreaking! This Ph.D. student was not a bad child when he was younger. But the long-term family and school education failed to teach him righteousness and filial piety. Furthermore, his wife didn't understand this either. If his wife had been understanding, would she have allowed her husband to do this? Therefore, when seeking a husband for your daughter, seek virtue. And when seeking a wife for your son, seek a virtuous woman. Don't focus on money. Focusing on money is short-sighted and opportunistic. If a person is short-sighted and opportunistic, how far can they see in their life, and how much future happiness can they have? This is an impossible prospect.

What is "the norm?" The five constants: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. "Benevolence" is not being selfish; "righteousness" is not being self-serving. Without benevolence and righteousness in one’s heart, one will surely be selfish and self-serving. A benevolent person loves others. He will first and foremost love his most kind and honorable parents. "Those who do not love their parents but love others are called immoral.” If someone doesn't even love their parents, that love is fake. It has ulterior motives and is not normal. Therefore, when seeking a partner, one should base their decision on virtue, especially the root of virtue - filial piety - and you won’t go too far astray.

“Righteousness" is moral principle, loyalty, and gratitude. *Xunzi* said, "If righteousness prevails over personal gain, the world will be well-governed". That is, if everyone places righteousness first, the whole society and country will achieve great peace. On the other hand, "If personal gain prevails over righteousness," people will prioritize making money. Even when their parents are gravely ill, they will not return home. This will lead to chaos in the world. We see that today, as soon as people have money, they buy nice houses for themselves while their parents live in run-down houses, or even renovate their own houses while leaving the old one next door for their parents. This is all putting self-interest over righteousness. When parents are poor and ill, siblings start shirking responsibility and pushing the parents around. But as soon as inheritance is involved, they all come running back. This is because they have not placed righteousness in their hearts; they put self-interest first.

I have an elder relative, who is probably around sixty years old, who said, "Our generation is the last to be filial to our parents, and we will be the first generation to be abandoned by our children.” If we calmly consider this, it highlights that this generation has worked very hard to earn money, but they have neglected their children’s education. Also, they might have rejected Chinese culture, thinking that “foreign things are better”, and sending their children to study abroad. The entire culture is rapidly being neglected, leading to a crisis of inheritance. Children do not understand these teachings from a young age. Therefore, it is everyone's responsibility to carry on the past and pave the way for the future. If we don’t pass on the teachings of our ancestors, we will be letting down our ancestors from thousands of years ago, and we will be letting down our children of the future.

The *Three Character Classic* says, "If one raises them but does not teach, it is a fault." If we do not teach them ethics and morality, we have made a mistake. "If teaching is not strict, the teacher is lazy". If schools do not teach this, even if they have students obtain master's and doctoral degrees, it is still a failure because they do not know how to behave properly. They might still get divorced. They might even use their master's and doctoral knowledge to commit crimes. Many fraud groups are not created by ordinary people; they are created by people with advanced skills. Therefore, all this reminds us that righteousness is important, and that we should not put the cart before the horse.

After benevolence and righteousness, comes “propriety,” which is respecting others. However, nowadays, people often raise their voices at their parents. If parents say one thing, children may retort with nine. This is a lack of propriety. Propriety means having moderation and a sense of appropriate behavior. Nowadays, many people have no restraint when it comes to spending money. Many college students are very extravagant, having several credit cards even before they start earning money. Traditional culture doesn't have this value system. This is the consumer culture of a utilitarian era. What is traditional culture? Living within one's means. Being debt-free is being carefree. How can you borrow money to spend?

Next comes "wisdom." Wisdom is the ability to grasp the fundamental. However, we have lost sight of the root of the five human relationships. We put more emphasis on the branches and valuing profit over righteousness. We have lost wisdom. Lastly is "trustworthiness," which is keeping our promises and more importantly, being true to our conscience. If we reflect on our growth process, we also saw our parents' hard work. In our hearts we said, “I will definitely be filial to my parents in the future.” This intention, once made, should never be forgotten. Only then can we be true to our conscience.

Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness – these are the five constants. If a person does not uphold the five constants, they lose their human dignity. This is followed by many negative consequences. Therefore, we must find the “norm,” the fundamental, of being human.

Earlier, I mentioned Emperor Shun. He was the epitome of filial piety. Confucius praised Emperor Shun, saying, "Shun’s filial piety is ultimate." Because of his filial piety, his inherent virtue was revealed. He became a sage, so "his virtue was that of a sage, and his rank was that of an Emperor.” The whole world was his. What great blessings he possessed! The field of blessings is cultivated by the heart. His ultimate filial piety attracted great blessings. If we don’t value filial piety now, the next generation will be ungrateful. Firstly, the elderly will be pitiful. Secondly, their lives will lack blessings. The *Book of Documents* says, "If you do good, you will receive all kinds of blessings. If you do bad, you will receive all kinds of calamities.” If the heart is not good, one doesn't understand filial piety, nor how to behave properly, calamities will increase and blessings will be depleted very quickly. In fact, we can observe many of these truths in front of our eyes. Emperor Shun's life is worthy of our study and gives us great inspiration for managing our own families. Therefore, "his virtue was that of a sage, and his rank was that of an Emperor.” His virtue and blessings reached their peak. "He owned the whole world, his ancestors were worshipped in temples, and his descendants continued his legacy." For thousands of years, his descendants worshipped him. His blessings were enormous, and his lineage has continued to this day.

Another modern-day moral exemplar is Meng Peijie, whom we also greatly admire. When she was five years old, her father passed away, and her mother, who was struggling to survive, sent her to be adopted by a lady. When she was eight years old, her adoptive mother was paralyzed. From that day on, this eight-year-old girl took care of her adoptive mother, whose weight was almost double her own. She took care of her for over a decade, even bringing her mother to her teacher’s training college. She moved many people to such an extent that the local hospital offered free treatment to her mother. Therefore, filial piety moves heaven and earth and inspires many to help. Now, her mother can use a wheelchair and her mobility has greatly improved.

In fact, it's not difficult to fulfill our filial duty, as long as we truly appreciate our parents' love in the details of everyday life. And if we think about the growing-up process realistically, if it wasn’t for our parents, where would we be today? The gratitude of mothers who carry their child for ten months, that is the gratitude of pregnancy and protection. The great suffering they endure in childbirth, that is the gratitude of labor pains. After giving birth, they put aside all those sufferings and start thinking of their children. That is “the gratitude of forgetting one’s suffering”. It is painful to give birth, but mothers never mention it to us. They have put aside that pain and thought only about us. Some children may be born with poor constitutions. For example, my elder sister was often unwell and had to go to the hospital, which caused my parents much worry.

One mother’s child was walking at night and carelessly fell down the stairs. The edge of the stairs hit his forehead, and he started bleeding profusely. The mother quickly rushed him to the hospital. After the bleeding was stopped at the hospital, the mother finally took a breath and realized that she was only wearing one slipper. When she saw her child bleeding, she completely forgot about herself and did everything as quickly as possible to send him to the hospital. She didn't even realize that she only had one shoe on.

Therefore, how many years have our parents selflessly given to us? We cannot grow up and forget these acts of kindness. Without our parents’ sacrifices, there would be no us today. They have given us the best of everything. They would quickly change us to a dry spot after we wet the bed, leaving the wet spot for themselves. There is also "the gratitude of feeding and nurturing.” As I mentioned earlier, the mother's milk is formed from her blood. There is also "the gratitude of washing and cleaning.” Before we were three years old, we were incapable of taking care of ourselves. Our parents cleaned up our messes. During the process of our parents raising us, the family also faced a lot of pressures and difficulties, but they never frowned in front of us. They always gave us smiles, hoping that we would grow up and not feel any pressure with school. But when we grow up and start our own families, we realize "only when you manage a household do you realize how expensive rice is; only when you raise children do you realize the kindness of parents.” There is also "the gratitude of taking on the hardships and giving us the sweetness". All the ups and downs, the sweet and the bitter, of family life are shouldered by our parents. They gave us the sweetness. Sometimes I think back, that when I wanted an expensive toy or an electric piano, it was very difficult for my parents, but they still bought them for us because they saw how much we liked them.

"The gratitude of thinking about us when we travel far." Even if we go away to study, our parents are still worried about us. For example, if we are attending university, we should let our parents see our living environment, so they can rest assured. We should make sure that our living environment is clean and our living habits are good, otherwise, our parents will worry even more.

"The gratitude of their deep care for us.” Especially when we get sick, our parents pray to the heavens and wish that the illness would be transferred to them, instead of making their children suffer. When a child has a high fever and cries, mothers cry alongside them. If surgery is required, I imagine it would be very difficult for parents. The scalpel cuts into the child's body, but the pain is in the mother's heart. I have also personally felt this “deep care” in the process of my father taking care of me. I have always been of poor constitution, easily catching colds and fevers. Sometimes when I wouldn't be able to get rid of the fever by 2 or 3 in the morning, my father would get up several times. He would place his hand on my forehead. In fact, my father didn’t know I was awake; I just didn't open my eyes. When his touch made him feel that the fever was down, his heart seemed to drop a rock, feel relieved, and go back to rest. There was no speech, but I could feel his heart through the touch of his hand. Furthermore, my father still had to go to work the next day, but when we were sick, he barely slept, and he still had to bear the responsibility of the family.

Lastly, there is the “ultimate mercy and pity,” “A mother of a hundred years still worries about her eighty-year-old child.” Our parents’ pity and love for us is lifelong. No matter how old we are now, we are always their children.

We cannot forget these kindnesses. If we don't, we will be able to appreciate our parents’ needs in the details of daily life and fulfill our filial duties. China now places great importance on filial piety. All children, by law, have the duty and obligation to provide for their parents. Of course, this is a fundamental aspect of being human; we shouldn't only do it because it's legally required. But the fact that China has these laws is a message to the whole world that caring for parents is a fundamental aspect of being human. This is very precious. We Chinese have not forgotten the fundamental nature of filial piety.

Now, China is taking the lead in emphasizing filial piety. The whole world is now looking at China, not only for its economy but, more importantly, for its culture. The world is recognizing the value of Chinese culture. It can help the world's utilitarian tendencies to return to righteousness and to filial piety. As Chinese people, we should demonstrate the spirit of filial piety and righteousness through our own lives. When people see it, they will be moved and will learn from it.

Earlier, I spoke of Meng Peijie. When she was receiving her award, the host shared her story, and everyone in the audience burst into tears. This is because of the inherent filial piety within everyone’s heart. Hearing her story moved everyone.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I have strived to maintain accuracy, natural flow, and the overall tone of the original text.

**Translation:**

Listening to Director Zhai talk, someone asked him what happiness meant to him in life. He said, "The greatest happiness in my life is when I return home, open the door, and can call out 'Mom!'" It was truly touching to hear.

Following this, the scriptures state:

**"To value wealth highly, but treat parents poorly, is not the way of a human child."**

To prioritize money while being unkind to one’s parents, even neglecting their care, is to be unworthy of being someone's child. Therefore, virtue is the root, filial piety is the root, and wealth is the branch. "To value wealth highly, but treat parents poorly," is to invert the order of importance. One who does not even possess the fundamentals of being a human being, how can heaven and earth still tolerate us? Won’t we be taken back by the heavens? Thus, a truly filial person will give everything they have to save their parents. A person who does not understand filial piety will prioritize money, even if they are wealthy, and will abandon their parents.

There’s an example from the Qing Dynasty. During the Qianlong era, in Nanxun Town of Huzhou, there was a man who gambled and accumulated debts. He asked his mother for money. She had none left. He said, "The clothes you are wearing can be pawned; they will fetch some money." Helpless, his mother said, "I'll take off this coat at your sister's house and give it to you there." Afraid of not receiving it, the son accompanied his mother on a boat across the river. In her heart, the mother planned to remove the coat once they reached the shore. Upon reaching the riverbank, the mother prepared to disembark.  Afraid she would not give it to him, the son grabbed at her clothes, insisting she remove her coat to pawn it. In the struggle, he pushed his mother into the river, and she drowned.  He then returned home, but not long after, he died a sudden and violent death. This is heavenly retribution. Therefore, being unfilial to one's parents is the greatest sin in the world. So these two lines of scripture help us deeply understand that filial piety is the foundation for a well-managed family. We must teach by our own example and pass down the way of the family.

Next, let us look at the next sentence:

**"When marrying off a daughter, choose a good son-in-law. Do not demand a heavy betrothal gift. When taking a daughter-in-law, seek a virtuous woman. Do not be preoccupied with a large dowry."**

A 'good son-in-law' is a virtuous and worthy husband. When choosing a son-in-law, you should look for one who is virtuous. The *Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian* of Taoism says, “If a man is not loyal and good, a woman will not be gentle and compliant.” So, when seeking a good man, filial piety, loyalty, and kindness are important standards. When choosing a wife, a daughter-in-law, filial piety, gentleness, and compliance are important standards. 'Seek a virtuous woman' - the “virtuous” here refers to a woman who is wise and has good character. "Do not be preoccupied with a large dowry" - do not calculate or covet a substantial dowry. "When marrying off a daughter, choose a good son-in-law. Do not demand a heavy betrothal gift," do not seek a high betrothal price or gifts. This sentence tells us that when choosing a partner for the next generation, we must value virtue, not material gain. These few lines teach us what is root and what is branch in the five cardinal relationships. When a man and a woman become husband and wife, the root is righteousness, and material gain is the branch. The same applies to friendships. Today in organizations, what kind of companies or leaders should we seek? Those who value righteousness, who genuinely want to serve society. When seeking good subordinates or staff, we should also look for those who value righteousness over material gain. Many large companies are brought down by just a few people, which is a result of inverting the proper priorities in employing people.

There's a saying: "Man proposes, but Heaven disposes." We need to know what is light and what is heavy, and we must learn to measure things. We should often use the scales of life to weigh what is important. When marrying off a daughter, is the betrothal price more important than the son-in-law’s virtue? Weigh it and see where the weight lies? These are all important decisions in life. If you weigh things incorrectly, you may jeopardize your own happiness or the happiness of the next generation. "Birds of a feather flock together," and people influence each other. If our thoughts and values are wrong, how can we attract good in-laws, good sons-in-law, and good daughters-in-law?

As we study *Zhu Zi’s Family Precepts*, do you sense how many times we've brought out the scales of life? Earlier, we talked about whether a child's character is more important or whether making money is more important. If you make money but your child's character is unhealthy, and you haven't accompanied them during their growth, how much money can you use to buy back a healthy character? Even eating out all the time since childhood versus eating a meal made with a mother's love makes a difference to health, so how much money can we use to buy our child's health? I have seen many mothers who are very devoted to caring for their families and children. Their children are strong. They have more energy than others in their studies and careers. Health accompanies you for your entire life. Yet now, mothers go out to earn money, and children eat out. Their health suffers. So I ask you, how much money can we use to buy a child's health? All these things must be measured.

So, when we understand these principles, we can often bring out these scales. Actually, this sentence "When marrying off a daughter, choose a good son-in-law. Do not demand a heavy betrothal gift" is extremely important. Why? Confucius' maternal grandfather understood this very clearly. That's why he married his daughter to Confucius' father, Shuliang He. *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, in the beginning, says, "Formerly, Lady Yan was about to marry her daughter to Shuliang He." What did Confucius' maternal grandfather do before he married off his daughter? He didn't look at whether they were rich; he first investigated whether they had any sages among their ancestors. After finding that they had many sages, he married his daughter to Shuliang He, and then Confucius was born. So we appreciate Confucius' benevolence, and we should also be grateful to his maternal grandfather.  It is difficult for a sage to be born. First, the maternal grandfather must have wisdom. Second, the mother must endure hardship to raise him. If we understand "When marrying off a daughter, choose a good son-in-law. Do not demand a heavy betrothal gift" correctly, perhaps today's Confucius will come from our own correct attitudes as parents and elders. "When taking a daughter-in-law, seek a virtuous woman. Do not be preoccupied with a large dowry." If someone's plan is to focus only on the immediate, they might think, "This woman is very wealthy. If I marry her, I won't have to work as hard for many years." If a man makes such calculations, depending on a woman for support, can he still be called a man?

The ancients left us something to ponder: "Those who associate because of profit, when the profit is gone, the relationship becomes distant." Friends or partners who associate because of profit, when the profit is gone, the relationship becomes distant. And without profit, they may even divorce. "Those who associate because of power, when the power falters, the relationship breaks off." Those who associate because of status, when they lose their status, the relationship ends. "Those who associate because of beauty, when the flower fades, the love wanes." A person's youth and beauty are not everlasting; they change. If an association or union is based only on physical attraction, eventually when that beauty fades, they will become resentful, and perhaps find someone more attractive and change their minds. "Those who associate because of the Dao, last until the end of time." When united by principle, they are inseparable and share joys and sorrows.

There is a good role model in history, Song Hong of the Eastern Han Dynasty. At the time, Emperor Guangwu’s sister, Princess Huyang, lost her husband. The Emperor wanted to help his sister find a good partner. His sister highly regarded Song Hong, so the Emperor acted as a matchmaker on his sister's behalf. He cited a popular saying, though the saying was also inappropriate: “With rank, one easily changes their friends; with wealth, one easily changes their spouse, isn't this human nature?" With rank, they change their friends; with wealth, they change their spouse, is that the human condition? Song Hong understood the Emperor's meaning, that he was proposing marriage. He immediately responded: “The friendship of humble times should not be forgotten.” Friends who helped us during our humble beginnings should not be forgotten.  “A wife who has shared hardship should not be abandoned.” The wife who shared hardship during one’s struggle should never be forsaken. Hearing this, Emperor Guangwu felt ashamed. Song Hong's commitment to his wife shocked the court of the time. No one dared betray their wives just because they were now of high status. Professor Liu Yuli of the Central Party School of China shared this story. As a result, an official came to thank her after class, saying that he was going to divorce but, after hearing the story of Song Hong, his sense of shame arose, and he no longer abandoned his wife.

So it is important to remember good stories. When the opportunity arises, tell them to friends and relatives. This might awaken their conscience. If you can really persuade someone not to divorce, this is a great deed. Their ancestors will bless you and be grateful.

This sentence not only applies to choosing a spouse, but it also applies to choosing friends and employees. We must value virtue and filial piety. Let's look at the next sentence:

**“Those who become obsequious upon seeing wealth and status are most shameful. Those who act arrogantly towards the poor are the most base.”**

When I taught students, I had them recite *Zhu Zi’s Family Precepts*. What piqued my curiosity was that when they recited a particular sentence, their voices suddenly rose. I listened carefully, and that sentence was this one. In fact, the principle hadn’t even been explained to them, but they intuitively sensed that the most unbearable and despicable behavior was to fawn over, flatter, and ingratiate oneself with those who are wealthy and powerful. Because that attitude itself is a form of greed, greed for wealth and status, which is not respected.

*Di Zi Gui* tells us, “Only in virtue and learning, and in talent and skill, if we are not as good as others, we should encourage ourselves to strive harder." It is important to constantly emphasize the improvement of one's own virtue, and one will earn respect. "If in clothing and food, we are not as good as others, we should not feel discontented." So we should value virtue, not wealth. You see, these sentences are all connected. "Virtue is the root; wealth is the branch." If a person makes wealth their ultimate pursuit, they will lose their integrity, and that is most shameful. Furthermore, their greed will become more and more extreme, and they will become more and more unhappy because they are greedy for wealth and desires. Desire is a bottomless pit. When we don't get what we want, we suffer. And now, there are many people who pursue fame, fortune, and wealth as the key to happiness. The more they pursue, the more they suffer. That's why there are so many people with mental illness now. Scientists say that when people are one or two years old, they laugh an average of 180 times a day. But now, adults laugh only an average of seven times a day. The more they live, the less they laugh. This is because their whole life's goal is wrong.

Therefore, the length of the steps we take is not the most important thing; the direction must be correct. The pursuit of fame and fortune is not the path to happiness in life. We should pursue a righteous life, which is where happiness lies. The pursuit of wisdom is the greatest source of happiness. My teacher doesn't have a penny to his name, but when I see his eighty-seven-year-old face, smiling with the purity of a newborn, it is like returning to his original nature. But those of us living into our 30s and 40s, the more we live, the less we laugh. Therefore, doing good is the greatest joy, helping others is the source of happiness. “With parents alive and brothers safe,” being able to be filial to parents and brothers, living in harmony, that is the greatest joy in life. “Looking up we are not ashamed of Heaven, looking down we are not ashamed of man.” To be worthy of one's conscience is the true happiness in life.

"Those who act arrogantly towards the poor" - the poor are already pitiful. If we are still arrogant, humiliating them and making them feel bad, we are the "most base." "Base" doesn’t refer to having no money or status; it refers to someone with a human body acting without integrity. Therefore, people are noble because of their actions, not because of their status. Madam Xu Zhe doesn’t have any money. Whenever she has money she gives it away. Yet, she is regarded as a national treasure of Singapore. Her actions are all filled with a spirit of helping others and self-sacrifice, therefore, she is noble.

So no matter how wealthy or influential you are, if your actions violate the principles of human dignity, it is base and despicable and makes people look down on you. Therefore, when you encounter the poor, you must not act arrogantly. By doing so, you are demeaning yourself. When encountering the poor, you must have compassion, the desire to help and care for them. Just like in *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* "Lin of Putian had a mother who loved doing good." She made rice flour cakes for the poor, and joyfully gave them to people. One person asked for six or seven rice flour cakes every day for three years, and she always happily gave them. Consequently, Lin’s descendants achieved great success, so much so that there was enough to fill a measuring cup with sesame seeds. There is a saying in Fujian: "The Chen and Lin families possess half the world,". The large number of descendants of the Lin family is related to this Lin of Putian.

The sentences we talked about today all helped us to deeply realize that virtue is the root, filial piety is the root, and righteousness is the root. Righteousness, kindness, and moral duty are the fundamentals; wealth is the branch. We must not live a life that inverts the order of importance. And we must, as Chinese descendants, embody these roots and lead the world back to its proper path. Alright, thank you everyone.


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural English flow:

**Lecture 13: Self-Respect, Self-Love, and Compassionate Forgiveness**

Respected elders and friends, good day! Last time, we discussed:

“[Those who fawn upon the wealthy are most contemptible. Those who act arrogantly towards the poor are the most base.]”

These teachings from the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* prompt us to reflect on our life’s values. What kind of values truly have meaning? What kind are truly noble? As the saying mentions, "fawning upon the wealthy" is a shameful act, driven by vanity and deserving of disrespect. In fact, the lack of respect we receive from others stems from a lack of self-respect and self-regard. Where does self-respect begin? It begins with having correct life values. We see how "fawning upon the wealthy" turns wealth into a life pursuit, even a desperate craving, a love for empty glory. When people encounter the wealthy, they seize the opportunity to flatter and fawn. But can wealth truly bring happiness? Can it truly secure a fulfilling life? We see many wealthy people in the world, and their troubles are often greater than those of the poor. This is because, as our ancestors said, "Desire is like an abyss." Pursuing fame, fortune, and desires is like falling into a bottomless pit. Therefore, pursuing a life of wealth and pleasure is an endless road, and the deeper one goes, the more one suffers from the "pain of unfulfilled desires." So, where should true joy come from? From contentment and appreciating what one has.

As the saying goes, "Even with a wealth of ten thousand, one eats only three meals a day; even with a mansion of a thousand rooms, one sleeps on only six feet of space." Therefore, human material needs are actually quite limited. If we pursue material pleasure and compare ourselves to others, it will only lead to "comparing oneself to others and being driven to envy," making us slaves to our desires.  Our spiritual nature will decline, and we won't fulfill our duties to parents, spouse, children, society, and nation. Spending a lifetime chasing wealth and fame is all just fleeting, like smoke and clouds – we cannot take it with us.

Therefore, those with true wisdom leave behind things that can endure and be carried forward. Those without wisdom chase after things they cannot take with them – external possessions – which may even leave a legacy of misfortune for their descendants.  Some wealthy business owners who have passed away cannot even be buried for a year or two because their descendants are in lawsuits, which is truly tragic.  In the *Three Character Classic*, our ancestors urged us, “Others leave their children gold that fills coffers; I teach my children only classic texts.”  Ordinary people, without a clear understanding of life's principles, focus on leaving their children as much money, property, and land as possible.  Those who are wise understand that if their children are virtuous, leaving them a mountain of wealth will only stifle their ambition; it "will diminish their aspirations." If their children are of lesser character than they are, leaving them money will only fuel their extravagance and vices.  Therefore, wise parents and elders decide not to leave material wealth to their children. Instead, what do they leave? They leave the classics, the examples of righteousness, loyalty, and benevolence that they have lived by.

What Mr. Fan Zhongyan left his descendants was his righteous and loyal life, his wholehearted commitment to caring for his family and for the poor in society, even impoverished scholars. He cultivated countless talents for both his family and society. In his official career, Fan Zhongyan embodied the principle, "to worry about the world's troubles before anyone else and to enjoy its happiness only after everyone else."  For eight or nine hundred years, which descendant of Fan Zhongyan has not emulated his loyalty and righteousness? This is what truly lasts—his moral character and example, which serve as a model for his descendants for centuries to come. This is the most meaningful life. He himself achieved perfect virtue and wisdom, which are things that one can take with them. All the good deeds he performed created boundless merit and blessings, which one can also take with them.  If we don't fully grasp the true values of life, not only will we accumulate a great deal of negative karma through the pursuit of fame and fortune, we might also do things that go against our conscience. We could even leave behind wealth that becomes the root of suffering for our descendants. That would be extremely unwise and unfair. It’s like the saying, "A petty person acts unjustly, to become a petty person."

Therefore, our ancestors told us in *The Great Learning* about the value of life: “The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting bright virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in perfect goodness.”  "Manifesting bright virtue" refers to the inherent wisdom and abilities that everyone possesses; this is the "nature is originally good" spoken of in the *Three Character Classic*.  In this life, our goal is to recover our innate goodness, our bright virtue, and our boundless wisdom and abilities – this is the value of self-love in life. Then there's the value of loving others.  "Loving the people"—this "people" includes one's family members, and extends to all the relatives and friends one encounters in life. We should strive to help them with all our ability.  When we leave this world, it is possible that our children or relatives may say that their lives were filled with happiness and they walked the right path because they encountered us.  This is "leaving a loyal heart shining in history." That is a meaningful life.

True joy in life definitely doesn't come from how many material possessions we have. People today mistakenly believe external stimulation is happiness, but that is not sustainable. It’s only the temporary fulfillment of desires, which may then grow even stronger. For example, if we eat delicious food, we’ll want to eat more; if we wear nice clothes, we’ll want to buy more; if we live in a luxurious villa, we won't be satisfied for long, and we'll seek even greater desires. That's why so many people suffer from depression and psychological disorders—they are all experiencing the pain of unfulfilled desires. Therefore, wealth does not bring true happiness in life. Instead, after attaining wealth, what should we do? We should benefit others, "love the people." By benefiting others, our hearts grow wider, we become less selfish, and our bright virtue is enhanced, so that we ourselves are happy, and others are happy as well.

Our ancestors told us that helping others is a joy, and doing good is the greatest joy.  Furthermore, they pointed out that true joy is something that spontaneously arises from within, without needing to spend money.  Confucius, in the first line of *The Analects*, tells us, "To learn and at due times to repeat what one has learned, is this not delightful?"  "Due times" means constantly and without interruption; "repeat" means to put into practice.  We must constantly practice what we have learned from the classics.  For example, the teachings tell us not to become angry. "One thought of anger arises, a million barriers open," and "one thought of anger arises, burning up the forest of merit." We know that we still often lose our temper.  So, having learned this, we must make an effort to constantly observe our thoughts and feelings. When we feel an emotion, we should immediately subdue it, and from then on not lose our temper.  When we don't lose our temper, our mind and body will feel at peace and happy. No circumstances will make us angry, so, "is this not delightful?"

If we don’t work on our inner selves and still have lots of greed and dissatisfaction, even if we are wealthy, we’ll still have many worries and much suffering. We might even find ourselves in opposition to people and things.  Therefore, if we truly let go of our greed, arrogance, and anger, our virtuous nature will manifest, bringing us true happiness in life. That is the joy of truly practicing the Way. It is what is meant by "finding joy in poverty and delight in the Way."

Therefore, "worldly pleasures cannot compare with the taste of the Dharma." Worldly enjoyment and excitement cannot compare with the happiness of truly releasing one's bad habits, nor can they compare with the joy of connecting with the sages of old. Yan Hui, Confucius’ disciple, had internalized this joy, which is why he was able to say, “A simple bowl of food, a ladle of water, living in a humble lane; others find it unbearable, but Yan Hui does not change his joy.”  This is what Confucius praised him for.  When ordinary people hear this, they may think, "How can I endure such a difficult life?"  In reality, the richer one’s spiritual life is, the fainter one’s material desires become. If our material desires are still so strong, we won't be able to understand this kind of life. If we truly immerse ourselves in the classics, we will feel like we don't have enough time in the day, and we won’t want to satisfy these desires. When we study diligently, there might even be two weeks or a month when we don't have any thoughts of indulgence, and our mind and body will feel very fulfilled and joyful. Sometimes, when we realize the virtue and intentions of the ancient sages, we may even find ourselves dancing with joy, feeling as if the sages are right there in our hearts.

Therefore, when we see wealthy people, we shouldn't fawn over them. Cultivating blessings depends on the heart, and wealth is also something one has cultivated. There's no need to flatter them. Flattery will not bring us anything. We should focus on cultivating our own blessings, so called "fields of gratitude, compassion, and respect". Flattery goes against these three spirits, not only bringing us scorn but also making it impossible to obtain blessings. Therefore, we should focus on our hearts and do good deeds, which will bring wealth.  And when we become wealthy, we shouldn't indulge ourselves, because that will make our spirit fall and turn us into slaves of our desires.  Instead, we should care for our family and help those in need, like Fan Gong, so we can embody the principle, "What was Shun? What am I? Anyone who exerts themselves can be the same.”

The next line of the classics is: “Those who act arrogantly towards the poor are the most base.”  Traditional culture teaches us to practice benevolence and love others. As the saying goes, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." If we were poor, we would naturally feel hurt if people looked down on us, despised us, or even scolded us. Since we wouldn't want to be treated that way, then if we have an arrogant attitude toward the poor, we would be violating the spirit of "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." Furthermore, this incorrect attitude is constantly diminishing our own blessings.

*Liao Fan's Four Lessons* says, "All blessings do not depart from the heart." Every day, our blessings can either increase or decrease, and be multiplied or divided. We need to embrace benevolence in order to cultivate blessings. How do we embrace the path of benevolence? First, we need to follow Mencius’ teaching to, "Do one's best to practice reciprocity, there is no better path to seek benevolence." Even if we must force ourselves, we should constantly maintain a spirit of forgiveness and compassion toward others.  "Reciprocity" means to put oneself in others’ shoes, to understand them as we understand ourselves, to feel the hunger of others as we feel our own, and to feel the drowning of others as we would feel our own.  When we see someone is poor, we must feel compassion for their poverty.  When we see someone is sick, we must feel compassion for their sickness.

There was a compassionate elder in Singapore, Ms. Hsu Che, who lived to be over 110 years old. Her mother also lived to be over 100. From this we can see that “benevolent people live long”.  In her autobiography, she recalled how, in her childhood in Shantou, their life was very difficult and their food was not good.  But they often experienced this: just as they were about to eat, someone would knock on the door. When her mother opened the door, she would see a group of emaciated people who had been starving for days. Her mother would immediately bring back the food from the table and give it to these people.  The children would follow their mother outside.  Ms. Hsu Che recalled that when she saw those people eating the food, she felt a joy in her heart, and seeing the gratitude those people had for their family, she was extremely happy.  Her mother’s benevolent actions deeply influenced them, so that all of her siblings dedicated themselves to social good, striving to help others with enthusiasm.  Therefore, when encountering poor people, we should understand their feelings.  We cannot "act arrogantly."

People are noble because of their actions, and they are noble because they can align with the benevolent virtue of Heaven. This phrase, "Those who act arrogantly towards the poor," reminds us to “Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire.”  Extending this principle further, we should remember that when we are in a wealthy position, we must still have compassion for the suffering and living conditions of the poor. For example, if we become a high official, we cannot just indulge in our wealth, but we must immerse ourselves in the life of the people. We must stay with them and do our best to serve and care for them.

Similarly, when we are young, we must show extra respect to the elderly and sympathize with their hardships. We must be aware of their needs in life; we cannot be strong ourselves and then look down on the elderly.  This is incredibly inappropriate. We will also grow old one day. As the saying goes, "What goes around comes around.” If we respect and care for the elderly today, we will surely be respected and cared for when we are old. The universe is a cycle; “what comes from you returns to you.” How we treat others determines how they will treat us.

Heaven also has good intentions, giving people the opportunity to repay the kindness of others. Taking filial piety, the most important foundation of being human, as an example, we receive our parents’ kindness, which allows us to grow and develop and be who we are today. We must repay our parents’ kindness in order to have a clear conscience. Our filial piety to our parents is the cause, which results in our children learning filial piety and carrying it on.  Ultimately, we will experience our children’s filial piety. This is all a cycle. If we don’t repay our parents’ kindness in this life, our lives will feel empty. Therefore, the ancients gave us the saying, “The tree desires stillness, but the wind won’t stop; the child wishes to provide, but the parents are gone.” This is a great regret in life.

The *Book of Odes* says, "Alas, my parents, who gave me birth with such toil."  He is in grief because his parents have passed away, and there is no way for him to be filial. Returning home, he feels as though he has no home to return to.  He cries out to heaven and earth, realizing that his parents’ kindness is as great as heaven and earth, and there is no way to repay it. Now, he doesn't have the chance. When we were little, our parents took care of us; now that our parents are old and their living abilities are diminishing, it’s time for us to take care of them, just as they took care of us when we were young. This is a very thoughtful arrangement from Heaven.

An elderly person expressed his feelings: “When I am old, and I am no longer the person I was, please understand me and have a little patience with me.” Elderly people may be slower in their movements, for example, when walking or eating. We should put ourselves in their shoes. “When I spill soup on my clothes, when I forget how to tie my shoelaces, please think about how I once taught you, step by step.” When we see this, we can recall our childhood when we learned how to eat and how to tie our shoelaces, all taught by our parents, one step at a time.  "When I repeat things that you have already heard many times, please listen to me patiently, and don’t interrupt. When you were young, I had to repeat the same stories hundreds of times until you fell asleep.” Our childhood was full of our parents’ love and patience, allowing us to grow. “When I need you to help me take a bath, please don’t be disgusted or scold me. Remember how I used to coax you to take a bath when you were a child?” “When I don’t know how to use new technology and new things, please don’t laugh at me. Remember how patiently I answered all your “whys”? "When my legs are tired and I cannot walk, please extend your young and strong hands to support me, just as I supported you when you were learning to walk.” When we learned to walk, we don’t know how many times we fell, but our parents were there to accompany us, so we could finally take each step steadily. Now, it's time for us to be grateful and repay that kindness. "When I suddenly forget what we were talking about, please give me some time to think. Actually, for me, what we are talking about is not important. As long as you can be by my side and talk to me, I am very satisfied. When you see me getting old, please don't be sad.  Understand me and support me, just as I did for you when you were first learning how to live.  At first, I led you on the path of life, and now please accompany me to the end of the path. Give me your love and patience, and I will respond with a grateful smile, a smile which embodies my boundless love for you.”

Reading this passage, we feel a deep sense of sadness.  If our parents said these words, we would truly feel unfilial. It must mean that our actions had caused them much pain to have to say these things. If we truly appreciate our parents’ kindness and turn it into action, we would be very aware of their daily lives. How would we ever let them say such helpless words? We should emulate the careful and patient ways of Huang Xiang from the Eastern Han Dynasty, who in winter made sure his parents were warm, and in summer that they were cool, which showed the needs of his parents were always met.  We should extend the compassion we have for our parents to love our family, our neighbors, our community, and society, and to "love everyone". Even further, we must extend that to love all life. The *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* later say, "Do not indulge in gluttony and wantonly kill animals for food." This demonstrates a continuation of filial piety and love.

If we can extend this love and compassion, we will always be able to put ourselves in others' shoes. For example, we have a stable life now, so we should have compassion for those who are suffering. Every day we should share the merit and blessings from studying the sages’ teachings with those who are suffering. This is all putting the principles of benevolence and reciprocity into practice. Also, when we are on the sidelines, we should also put ourselves in the shoes of those experiencing hardship. As the saying goes, "You don't know how hard something is until you've experienced it." When people cannot put themselves in other’s shoes, sometimes they may be harsh and unkind in their words, trivializing difficult matters and belittling those with wisdom. This is not the way of reciprocity. What should the way of reciprocity be?  "Loyalty" means to do one’s best to assist and help, not speaking cynically, nor criticizing. "Reciprocity" means to empathize, using words that are understanding and encouraging, and not critical.

Let's look at the next line:

“[In the home, avoid lawsuits. Litigation leads to ultimate misfortune.]”

We can see that these classic teachings point out the keys to the rise and fall of a family. In daily life at home, we must not fight or litigate, and we must not take family members to court.  This will inevitably lead to misfortune. Once litigation occurs, regardless of the outcome, it will bring misfortune to both sides and to the whole family, especially to the next generation, who will be exposed to a negative example, leading to the downfall of the family. If we look at society today, have we ever heard of a family that has become more prosperous after they engaged in a lawsuit? I have not heard of such a thing in my life. Nor have I heard from any of my elders, relatives, or friends, of any family that became wealthier after a lawsuit. Therefore, people who do not understand the principles of life, often do foolish things. There are so many families fighting lawsuits today, but are any of them doing well? No one reminds them!

There was a business owner who engaged in a lawsuit with his brother over property issues. After encountering traditional culture, especially reading *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, and the teachings on “brothers should be friendly, and younger siblings should be respectful, when brothers are harmonious, filial piety lies within”, he began to self-reflect and immediately dropped the lawsuit.  Now, his business is doing even better. “No one is a sage, who can be without fault? To err and be able to correct oneself is a great good."  What was most commendable was that after seeing these teachings, he also understood his mother’s feelings. The mother, seeing her two sons fighting in court, probably could not even sleep well.  “Filial piety and fraternal love is the root of benevolence.” We must begin by practicing filial piety and brotherly love.  A common saying also tells us that if the family is harmonious, all things will prosper. If a family wants to avoid lawsuits, they must return to cultivating their personal character. Only after personal character has been cultivated can a family be harmonious. If one doesn’t cultivate their personal character, it’s very easy to become confrontational and quick to blame others, making it difficult to avoid conflict with one’s own family.

In the *Moral Education Textbook*, there is a story about a scholar named Miao Tong. He had several younger brothers whom he had raised.  These brothers and their wives wanted to divide the family property. If it were us, we might feel hurt, thinking “These people are so ungrateful. I raised them, and they don't remember my kindness.  They actually want to divide the family property.” We might feel upset, and perhaps we might even lose our temper and start arguing with our brothers.

I once met an elder whose younger brother he had raised. But his brother didn’t remember his kindness, and he did not understand him. As a result, the older brother, even when he was in his eighties or nineties, was still complaining about this. Of course, the younger brother was wrong to forget the kindness of his brother, but the older brother was also causing himself suffering.  Taking care of his brother was fulfilling a sense of duty. It was something he should have done, and we cannot demand understanding from our siblings or relatives. We should do what we must, and then our conscience will be clear. If people do their duty, they will naturally receive blessings. We shouldn’t dwell on these people or things, nor should we be obsessed with them and be upset every day. In fact, when we let go of the pain within, the burden on the hearts of those who love us most will also be released.

To avoid conflict and struggle when faced with misunderstanding or unreasonable demands from one's family, we should emulate Miao Tong’s mindset. His brothers were blinded by immediate gain and wanted to divide the family property. But he did not blame them. Instead, he went inside, closed the door, and said to the ancient sages that he was ashamed. He had studied the sages’ teachings all his life but had failed to cultivate his personal character or bring harmony to his family.  He felt as though he had failed his ancestors and the teachings of the sages, and then he slapped himself in the face.  Miao Tong was always thinking, “If one does not achieve a goal, then turn inward and seek the answer within.” It was always his own fault. When people self-reflect, sincerity will naturally arise.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow while retaining the original meaning and tone.

**Translation:**

His younger brother and sister-in-law, seeing the situation, were moved by their conscience. Their elder brother had taken such good care of them, and deep down, they admired him greatly. It was only for a fleeting moment that the thought of competing for personal gain arose. Yet, not only did their elder brother not criticize them, he even reflected on his own actions. This immediately awakened their conscience, and they both knelt down to apologize to him.

From Miao Tong's attitude towards life, we can learn, what is the state of mind for human interactions within the world? "Except for self-blame and self-exertion, there is no other principle." Here, “blame” refers to self-reflection, and “exertion” means to do one’s best. This phrase encompasses all principles. “Self-blame” is to look inward, to be true to one’s conscience, for only through self-examination can we continually cultivate our virtue. “Self-exertion” is to do one's best, and by extension, to do our best to help our relatives and friends. Therefore, self-blame and self-exertion are still the way of conscientiousness and reciprocity. Confucius's way is simply “conscientiousness and reciprocity.” When faced with any situation, people should not be emotional but first ask: "Where did I go wrong?" This also corresponds to the *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts*: “When conflicts arise, how can we know it is not our own fault? We must calmly reflect.” When disagreements occur, one should first reflect on oneself. This reflective mindset is likely to resonate with the other party. When we reflect and admit our mistakes, the other person may immediately reflect as well. Therefore, Miao Tong is a good role model for self-cultivation and family management.

Furthermore, we should also contemplate what causes conflicts within families. The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (Di Zi Gui) says: "Value material possessions lightly, and resentment will not arise; exercise forbearance in speech, and anger will naturally disappear." In a family, if one can take material possessions lightly and control one's emotions and avoid losing one’s temper, many disputes can be resolved. In ancient times, siblings and relatives could truly live by this principle. Like the teaching on how brothers should interact that was mentioned earlier: "The same breath connecting branches, each flourishes on its own." Parents are our roots, and siblings and descendants are the branches. "A few words should not hurt feelings," which is to say we must exercise forbearance in speech, understand patience, humility, and non-contention, and not bicker over trivial matters. This will turn major issues into minor ones, and minor ones into non-existent ones. “Every time we meet, we grow older; how long will we have as siblings?" Take material possessions and wealth lightly. What should we remember? Remember the kindness. How did my older sister treat me in the past? How did my older brother treat me in the past? “Brothers living together should endure for peace; do not cause disputes over small matters. Children born now will also be brothers; leave an example for your children and grandchildren to follow." Provide a good example for future generations to avoid disputes and emphasize family harmony brings prosperity.

We see that the Zhou Dynasty lasted for over eight hundred years because the ancestors of the Zhou, such as Taibo and Zhongyong, ceded their kingdom to their younger brother. What else was there to fight over? In the Han Dynasty, Zhao Xiao and Zhao Li were willing to sacrifice their lives for their brothers. What else was there to fight over? Therefore, being able to take material possessions lightly and endure one’s temper, this is about eliminating greed and anger through self-cultivation, and naturally, with self-cultivation, family harmony will follow.

There is another true example: Cui Shaodi of the Song Dynasty married into the Su family. When she married into the family, there were already four elder sisters-in-law. These four sisters-in-law often quarreled and even fought. Before she married in, her relatives and friends were worried about her. However, her heart was very calm, because she deeply believed "At the beginning of man, his nature is inherently good." She only aspired to be sincere; she was only afraid that her sincerity would not be enough, not afraid of not being able to move others. As the saying goes, “There is no one who cannot be transformed, one need only fear that sincerity is lacking.”

After marrying in, because she was the youngest, she took the initiative to take on some of the heavier chores. She told her mother-in-law, "I am younger, so I should do more; my sisters-in-law are more tired." She gave her labor. Furthermore, she would give away material possessions. When she returned to her maiden home, she would bring back good things and always give them to her sisters-in-law and nephews first, without any selfishness. Once, while she was holding her nephew, the child suddenly urinated. Her sister-in-law felt embarrassed, because she knew that Shaodi's clothes were very precious. She quickly tried to take the child back, but Shaodi immediately said, “Don't rush, holding him so quickly might scare the child.” I believe at that moment her sister-in-law must have been very moved. She had dirtied Shaodi’s clothes, and not only was Shaodi not upset, she even thought about her child's feelings and worried that he might be frightened. I believe that after one, two, or three times of such occurrences, the most hardened hearts would be moved.

Also, when her sisters-in-law would gossip, she would listen without replying, just smiling and not joining in. If her own maids gossiped, she would severely discipline them, and make them apologize to the parties involved, and to her sisters-in-law. Although she seemed strict, she was in fact truly loving her servants, because they would later marry into other families. If they enjoyed gossiping, they would not be happy in the future. The sisters-in-law gossiped, this was a bad habit they had formed in the past, but people have a conscience. They talked, and when they saw that Shaodi did not reply, they felt guilty themselves and slowly stopped. Shaodi then led them to see the good in everyone, and slowly the content of their conversations changed. From speaking about others' faults, they gradually learned to be grateful to everyone. Therefore, within about a year of her marrying into the family, all four sisters-in-law were moved. They told others, "Our fifth sister-in-law is a virtuous person. "The fifth sister-in-law is extremely virtuous; we are not human in comparison.” We were also moved by hearing this, because everyone has a conscience, and everyone has a desire to become a sage or virtuous person. When they saw such a good example, they repented and wanted to emulate her.

Therefore, scholars who read about such an example, greatly admired her, saying, "With three instances of contending and three of yielding, the world would have no greedy people." When others compete for material possessions, we should yield. Slowly people will think you are a gentleman and not want to be a petty person. “With three instances of anger and three of smiles, the world would have no wicked people.” When others treat us with hostility, we should respond with a smile and kindness, even apologizing: "I am sorry, I am sorry." Maybe they misunderstood us, but we should still apologize to them because they are emotional at the moment. When they calm down and clarify the situation, realizing they had misunderstood, they will be even more ashamed and moved by the other’s virtue. Later, these four sisters-in-law no longer quarreled. "It takes two to tango." If one of the two is truly virtuous, they cannot start a quarrel.

“At home, one should avoid litigations, for litigations always end in misfortune.” This applies not only to families, but also to friendships, leader-to-leader relationships, and even within one’s own business, where cooperative partners should do the same. Even competitors should have healthy interactions instead of attacking each other, or else misfortune will follow. I remember when I was little, for example, if I went to a bookstore and the book was out of stock, the owner would still say, "You can find it at such-and-such bookstore nearby." They respected each other, and they believed that harmony brings prosperity, and that there’s plenty of money for everyone to make. Nowadays this has changed, with people criticizing and slandering each other, which only makes customers uncomfortable. Moreover, if one constantly engages in such malicious fighting and slandering of others, it is bound to deplete one's blessings, and one's business will only worsen. One should help others within the same industry, learning from each other's experiences and complimenting each other. Only in this way can one truly have good fortune and bring prosperity through harmony.

Those who truly understand principles will choose to be tolerant and forgiving of others’ mistakes rather than engaging in litigation, because "If it is meant to be yours, it will eventually be yours; if it is not meant to be yours, do not force it." Money gained through lawsuits may have been originally intended for us, but we have also depleted a large portion of our blessings in the process. If we have a great capacity and great blessings, we can be tolerant of others and not be calculating, and this will actually increase our blessings. Losses in one place will be compensated in another. Furthermore, we should think: would people rather follow someone who is constantly fighting, or a leader who has great tolerance? I believe that a person who is truly calm will choose to follow someone with great tolerance, someone who can teach the principles of life; following a leader who is constantly fighting will only lead to endless turmoil.

The virtue of the ancients was that if they heard from a friend that someone was talking badly about them behind their back, they would say, "I am good friends with him, he would not speak ill of me. I only remember his kindness to me, he would not speak ill of me." Then the friend would say, "He really did speak ill of you, even mentioning your name." Then they would say, "There are many people with the same name, it could not have been me.” They would not be angry, and thus the conflict would not worsen. Conflicts worsen when one person curses, and the other person curses back, and the cursing escalates. When one person hits, and the other person hits back, the hitting gets worse. As long as one does not curse, one does not retaliate, the conflict will be resolved. The person who cursed would later realize that the other person was not only not angry but also said, "I am very good friends with him, he has treated me well in the past,” and the person does not hold any grudges. They will slowly feel embarrassed. Therefore, we should use virtue to transform others, rather than engaging in temporary verbal squabbles, and causing conflict with others.

The following passage in scripture says:

【In dealing with the world, be mindful of excessive speech. Too much talk is bound to lead to mistakes.】

When dealing with the world, one must be careful with one's words. One should not speak too much, because too much talk is bound to lead to mistakes. You might say the wrong thing and cause unnecessary trouble, or even worse, bring misfortune upon yourself. Therefore, Confucius divided his teaching into four categories: "Virtuous conduct, speech, politics, and literature," and he placed speech in the second position. Improper speech can lead to conflicts and disputes wherever you go. You will do more harm than good. Therefore, elders remind us to cultivate moral speech and accumulate good deeds through our speech, or our good fortune will be lost through our mouths.

For example, if one enjoys criticizing or mocking others, enjoys saying hurtful things, then one depletes a great deal of good fortune every day. If one understands the importance of moral speech, then one can comfort and encourage others daily, saying things that are beneficial to others. For example, if someone is thinking about taking their own life, and one's words can persuade them to change their mind, then that accumulates great virtue in secret. For example, “Upon seeing others’ good, one should aspire to be like them,” “Speaking of others’ good, is good itself.” Towards those who are truly moral and learned, we should not be envious but instead praise them and encourage more of the public to learn from them. This is called "rejoicing in others' merit," and everyone who benefits is related to your praise, which shows the importance of moral speech. One thought of "Speaking of others’ good is good itself" has great merit, but one thought of envy, slander, or criticism will sever the faith and connections of many people, and the resulting sin will be very great. Therefore, for ourselves, we must put in a lot of effort to improve our speech. In a group, we must pay attention to moral speech in order to truly live harmoniously.

We must understand that speech is the sound of the heart, a manifestation of our inner being. Therefore, if there is a problem with our speech, it is ultimately because our heart is biased. We must make an effort at the level of the heart. For example, “In dealing with the world, be mindful of excessive speech; too much talk is bound to lead to mistakes.” Too much talk is a behavior. Where is the problem? The problem is that the heart is too restless. *The Book of Changes* tells us, “A virtuous person's words are few; a restless person's words are many." Restless people talk too much and cannot settle down; virtuous people are stable and calm and speak few words.

During the Jin Dynasty, the Chancellor Xie An was visited by the three children of Wang Xizhi. After the visit, someone asked, which of these three brothers has the best virtue? Xie An said that the youngest, Wang Xianzhi, was the best. His two older brothers had talked a lot of meaningless things, while he had politely greeted the elders and then humbly listened to them. Because the opportunity to meet a chancellor with such life experience and wisdom is rare, one’s attitude must be respectful, humbly listening rather than speaking too much. Later, Wang Xianzhi did become the most accomplished of the three. *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* also teaches us: “Too much talk is worse than too little; say only what is true; do not be glib or clever.”

There is a great deal to learn about speech. We must be able to observe the intention behind our words (what is our purpose), whether our attitude is good, whether our methods are appropriate, and whether the timing of our speech is correct. A person who is very cautious with their speech understands well that "one word can build a nation; one word can destroy a nation.” Speech has a great impact. As the saying goes, "Years of friendship can be destroyed by one cold word," and many years of friendship can be lost with one harsh and inconsiderate word. Furthermore, regarding one's own blessings, there is a saying, "One word can wipe out half a lifetime of blessings." One harsh word can wipe out half a lifetime of blessings. Some people speak very unkindly, making people so angry they cannot even speak, or even making people suicidal, and this diminishes half a lifetime of blessings.

Many families have experienced long-lasting separations due to careless speech, such as divulging family secrets. It is very important not to reveal family problems. For example, in a marriage, if the wife talks badly about the husband everywhere, and then it reaches the husband's ears, the husband will surely be furious and unable to forgive the wife, which will lead to trouble. If the husband’s faults are not talked about, and only good things are mentioned, and this reaches his ears, the husband will think, "I have so few good qualities, yet my wife praises and appreciates me so; and she is so tolerant of my many faults. She treats me this way, it makes me admire her, I must not let her down; I will improve my good qualities and get rid of my faults.” By praising his good qualities and being tolerant of his faults, you are awakening his conscience. If you do not praise his good qualities but instead talk about his faults, the rift will only deepen.

Therefore, speech should be rational and one should consider the consequences. One must not create obstacles that will be very difficult to overcome throughout one’s life. This is true not only for spouses, but also for mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. If a mother-in-law talks badly about her daughter-in-law everywhere, and the daughter-in-law hears about it and becomes angry, she will also talk badly about the mother-in-law. Won't this make the whole family a laughingstock? Therefore, as a local saying goes, "The mother-in-law carries a drum, speaking ill of the daughter-in-law everywhere," and the drum is very loud, "dong, dong"; and "the daughter-in-law bangs a gong, speaking ill of the mother-in-law everywhere," and the gong is even louder. If there is such a cause, there will be such an effect. This endless cycle will not stop. Not revealing family problems is a timeless principle for managing the family, one that must not be violated.

A mother-in-law should tolerate her daughter-in-law’s shortcomings, especially since many daughters-in-law nowadays are only children. If there is a karmic connection with the daughter-in-law, she must also teach her. As the saying goes, “Teach children in their infancy; teach wives when they first arrive.” The mother-in-law must teach, the husband must teach, and they must teach patiently, not criticize or talk badly about her everywhere. Be tolerant of her shortcomings, and praise her good qualities. When the mother-in-law praises her, and this is eventually heard by the daughter-in-law, she will think, "My mother-in-law is so tolerant, she tolerates all of my shortcomings; she praises even my few good qualities.” She will be very encouraged and will work even harder to be a good daughter-in-law. Then the daughter-in-law will not talk badly about the mother-in-law, but instead praise her virtues. When the mother-in-law hears this, she will also be moved and love her daughter-in-law even more. By praising each other, the mother-in-law will gain another daughter, and the daughter-in-law will gain another mother, and it all starts from not revealing family secrets.

Since we know the impact of our speech on our own self-cultivation, family, and the entire group, we should be more cautious and calmly observe the purpose of every word we speak, and what mentality we should have when speaking them. *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* has a teaching that highlights the key steps in speech: "If parents have faults, correct them with gentle words; be pleasing in appearance, and gentle in tone; If corrections are not heeded, correct again with a happy heart; shed tears of sorrow as they may, and endure any beatings without complaint.” “If parents have faults, correct them with gentle words," represents what is our goal? The goal is to hope that parents or family members will correct their faults for their own good. What mindset do we have? We have a loving and sincere heart when we persuade them. Once our goal and intentions are clear, what about our attitude? It must be gentle: "Be pleasing in appearance, and gentle in tone." If our attitude is aggressive when trying to persuade others, they will be very resistant to accepting it. “If corrections are not heeded,” if we try to persuade someone once and they are not moved, "correct again with a happy heart.” Every word in *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* holds the wisdom of life. “Happy” refers to finding a suitable time to persuade them; and “again” means we must be patient and remind them patiently again and again, “again” means we must be patient. “Shed tears of sorrow as they may, and endure any beatings without complaint.” If parents or family members do not understand, even scolding or blaming us, not understanding our good intentions, we must not change our original intention. Our intent is to love them and help them correct their faults, not to expect any reward from them. Instead, even when they do not understand, we must not forget our original intention, and be even more tolerant and wait for a good time to persuade them again, not rushing to do so in the moment.

That is where I will stop our discussion for today. Alright, thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**Lecture 14: A Gentle Mouth, A Kind Heart**

Respected elders and friends, good day! Last time, we discussed:

[Be cautious of excessive talk when navigating the world. Too much talk inevitably leads to mistakes.]

Speech is a crucial cultivation for life, family, and society. For oneself, lacking a sense of proper speech can easily lead to diminished blessings and misfortune. For a family, a lack of moderation in speech can cause discord and conflict. For society, immoderate speech can create divisions and clashes within groups, and even, as the saying goes, "a single word can uplift a nation, a single word can destroy it." For example, "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." Why is the rise and fall of the nation related to ordinary people? The "rise" and "fall" actually lie within people's hearts. When people’s hearts are kind and value morality, the weather is favorable, the family is harmonious and happy. When people's hearts are unkind and prioritize profit over righteousness, the family and nation are in decline. Whether a society emphasizes morality or is driven solely by profit depends on each of us.

We see that many young people today are very selfish, prioritizing their own interests. This is the result. The cause lies in the previous generation placing profit before righteousness. "If people do not learn, they will not know righteousness." If we don't teach them the principles of being a good person, they will develop self-centered and selfish habits from a young age. I remember when I was a child, listening to elders discuss which college major was good or which career was best, I would always hear things like: "So-and-so is a doctor, earning tens of thousands every month," or "So-and-so is in this profession, making a lot of money." So the purpose of choosing a major was all about making more money, which meant our generation put money first in all considerations. Because we valued profit over righteousness, the phenomenon of not wanting to care for the elderly has emerged. Now, in many rural areas, children leave and don't take care of their aging parents. Also, the divorce rate is getting higher and higher, and marital relationships are fragile. Siblings are going to court over property. These situations are all caused by people's hearts valuing profit over righteousness. This trend, however, might have slowly formed through our everyday conversations. "It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep."

Therefore, "be cautious of excessive talk when navigating the world, too much talk inevitably leads to mistakes." When do we make mistakes? When what we say does not align with the classics, we are in error, because we are misleading social mores. How many sentences do we speak every day? Roughly estimated, perhaps five hundred. If these five hundred sentences are all in accordance with morality, we gain much merit each day. If those five hundred sentences give wisdom, bring benefit, give confidence, and give warmth, then the merit of that day could change one’s destiny. However, if the vast majority of the five hundred sentences do not align with the classics, then we have greatly diminished our blessings that day. Therefore, our ancestors taught us to cultivate virtuous speech. Because we speak so many words each day, if our hearts are benevolent, our words will not deviate from benevolence. If our hearts are callous, then every sentence we speak may cause discomfort to others.

Therefore, we must be responsible for our words. For example, if parents' ideologies are wrong, their words may mislead their children for a lifetime. So, parents cannot lose their temper or speak carelessly in front of their children. This has a huge negative impact on children's lives.

I once heard an example. A teacher who worked in administration at an elementary school had a child who also attended the same school. The child was inherently kind, and knowing that his father worked late, he would volunteer to help the teachers and the class by staying behind to close the windows and do the final check.

Scientists have conducted experiments that show the innate kindness of children. For example, when an adult purposely drops something in front of a one- or two-year-old, the child will waddle over, pick it up, and try to return it to the adult. At one or two years old, the parents have not taught them "If someone drops something, you should pick it up and give it back." This comes from their inherent nature to be good. Therefore, the affection between father and son is innate. Furthermore, children have a concern for others and an ability to feel empathy. For example, when two or three-year-old children are playing, one might run ahead, and the other follows behind. If the one in front falls heavily, with a loud thud, the one who fell hasn't even started crying yet, but the child behind will start to cry. Why? Because children's hearts are very sensitive; they can feel the pain of others. So, when the first one falls down, the second cries first because the first hasn't registered the pain and doesn’t have time to cry yet, but the second one cries. As a result, the second child's mother will say, "Why are you crying? It's not you who got hurt, it's him!" stifling the child's innate goodness.

Once, when I went to Shandong, a friend's four-year-old granddaughter was given a large, live fish in a basin by their neighbor. Because it was too big, its tail was sticking out, so they cut it off, and blood started to flow. The four-year-old girl saw it and cried uncontrollably, "It hurts! It hurts!" Therefore, Mencius said, "Be loving to your kin, and from there be benevolent to the people, and from there love all things." People with compassion can feel the pain of animals. These examples all show the innate nature of children, but they need to be taught.

One of our colleagues shared that when his child was two or three years old, they would cry when they saw violent scenes on television and would refuse to watch, saying, "It's so pitiful!" However, when the child was six or seven years old, watching the same violent scenes on television, the child was shouting, "Kill! Kill! Kill!" At two or three years old, they would cry, but after six or seven, they were cheering. This shows that their exposure to things has been corrupted. Our children may be contaminated by bad television programs or even by our own wrong ideas.

The child I mentioned earlier, who was in the first grade of elementary school, was very enthusiastic and would always help the class. After helping out, he would go to his father's office and go home with him. This went on for quite a while. One day, he went to his father's office as usual, and his father said to him, "Why is it always you doing it? You're so stupid, you're letting people take advantage of you!" The child was stunned. He had been doing it happily, and he would skip and jump all the way to his father's office. In reality, we should understand that helping others and doing good deeds bring the greatest happiness. This is the correct ideology. But because the father said such a thing, the child was stunned. However, his father was someone he highly admired, so he listened to his father's words. From that day on, the child stopped doing it. He didn't want to be taken advantage of and became more calculating. "Why should I be doing it?" When you start calculating, what do you become? A callous person.

In the fourth grade, one day he scolded a classmate whose father had passed away, saying, "You have no father!" The classmate cried sadly. Someone who used to be happy to help others, because of his father's misguided words, became so callous. He scolded a classmate for not having a father, and not long after, his family was robbed. His father, who had a bad temper, chased after the thief relentlessly, finally cornering him in a dead end. The thief, perhaps desperate, turned around and stabbed the father, hitting a vital spot and killing him. The boy, after scolding someone for not having a father, became fatherless himself. This story was shared with his teacher when he was in middle school, as a part of his own self-reflection.

Think about it, if this child had maintained his benevolence and generosity, and if his father had even encouraged him, would his family have ended up this way? Therefore, parents' ideology will determine a family's fate. Thoughts determine actions; actions determine habits; habits form character (a callous character leads to a lack of blessings); and character determines destiny. This story gives us a very important lesson: we cannot speak carelessly. We must speak in accordance with the classics and the truth. Confucius said that he was "a transmitter, not an innovator; believing in and loving the ancients." Sages speak very rigorously and carefully. What they speak is in line with the teachings of the sages. We cannot just speak carelessly. "Believing in and loving the ancients" means having complete faith and trust in the teachings of the ancient sages, not doubting them. Because the teachings of our ancestors are the unchanging truth that has been passed down for five thousand years.

To speak cautiously, firstly, we cannot go against truth. I once heard someone say, "It doesn't matter what profession you choose, as long as you can make money." Is this not misleading to the public? Yes! "A gentleman loves wealth, but he attains it by proper means." How can we speak so carelessly?

I also once heard a mother say, "It doesn't matter whether my child is filial to me or not, I have my own pension anyway." This should never be said to anyone, or the karmic debt will be huge. This statement tells the next generation that they do not need to be filial to their parents. If the next generation is not filial to their parents, they will have no basis for being a good person. This is not only a disaster for the elderly, but also a great disaster for these young people.

She also had the idea of “I have my own pension anyway.” She is not old yet, and how can she know for sure that she will receive her pension? Today, she tells people that they don’t need to be filial to their parents. Will young people learn to respect the elderly? No. Twenty years from now, they will be in charge of the country. If they are not filial to their parents or respectful to the elderly, will they remove the welfare benefits for the elderly? It is possible. When they want to enjoy more blessings and do not respect their elders, they will naturally take away the rights of the elderly. Where will the pensions of the elderly be then? So, this lady thinks her calculations are great, but man proposes, God disposes. Education is the key; only education is lasting. Although we may see immediate benefits, if we don't educate the next generation well, nothing will turn out the way we hope. Therefore, “the most important thing is educating your children.” In this life, nothing is more important than educating the next generation well, not only our own children, but the next generation of society as a whole.

Besides speaking truthfully and not misleading people, Confucius said, "Strength, resolution, simplicity, and slowness of speech are close to benevolence." "Strength" means to be strong-willed, not tempted by desires. Wealth, lust, fame, and food cannot tempt him. Those who are not tempted have pure hearts and are close to benevolence. "Resolution" means decisiveness, courage in the face of righteousness. "Those who have virtue are sure to have courage." Benevolent people can "sacrifice their lives to achieve benevolence, and give up their lives to uphold righteousness." Therefore, having this "resolution" and the courage to practice benevolence makes one close to benevolence.

Many entrepreneurs are now implementing traditional "family culture" concepts in their businesses, making the public believe that ethics and morality can make a business successful, giving everyone faith in traditional culture, and inspiring them to study it. People who do not study traditional culture and morality are falling, so these entrepreneurs could not bear to see that, and took the initiative to implement these values in their businesses. This is also “resolution.” If twenty major companies implement traditional culture in their companies, giving confidence to all of China and Chinese people all over the world, this would be a truly great foundation for the revival of traditional culture, giving the public belief. Because people today are very pragmatic, they ask “if I learn traditional culture, will I have a future?" If companies that study and implement traditional culture are doing increasingly well, everyone will have faith.

One newspaper wrote that Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University requires freshmen to do thirty hours of volunteer work during their summer vacation before entering the school, and they also have to study a classic called "The Standards for Being a Student.” When these famous schools take the lead, "when a nation is about to prosper, it will surely have auspicious signs." So, when these companies are doing well in leading this, schools will slowly follow suit. This is "resolution."

“Simplicity” means to be simple, not flashy, not vain. One’s essence is good, and benevolent people do not seek vanity, so they are close to benevolence.

“Slowness of speech” means to be hesitant to speak, and appear not to be good at talking. In reality, it means that they are cautious in their speech, considering the feelings of others. If someone is in the court and working for the benefit of the people, they will be eloquent, but in private conversation, they will be more reserved and slow to speak. Why? They need to consider whether their words will hurt people. For example, if someone has just lost their father, and we talk about how good our father is to us, not knowing their situation, we might be touching upon a sensitive topic for them. Including being cautious about their background and whether they have any taboos, or any past trauma. We should not offend people’s taboos, or unknowingly offend and hurt others.

There is a saying, "If a matter is related to someone’s lifelong reputation, even if you have seen and heard it, and are certain it is true, do not speak of it. If a word could damage my integrity, even in casual banter, or light-hearted joking, be cautious and do not say it." If a matter relates to someone's lifelong integrity, even if I have genuinely seen and heard it, and I am sure it is true, I cannot speak of it, why? We need to see the person's latter half of their life; a prodigal son returning home is worth more than gold. If we keep mentioning people’s past mistakes, we leave them no opportunity to repent and make changes, and they will lose face in front of others. This damages our own integrity. By not broadcasting their mistakes, by being forgiving and encouraging, they will be more willing to repent. Even if someone has been insulted and framed, if we keep mentioning it, wouldn't we be re-opening old wounds? It’s like someone who already has a wound, and we’re sprinkling salt on it.

"If a word could damage my integrity, even in casual banter, or light-hearted joking, be cautious and do not say it." If what we say hurts our own integrity, if our words contain sarcasm or mockery, even if it is in casual conversation or joking, we should not speak those words. Even if we are trying to make the atmosphere more pleasant, we should never use mockery or belittle others. How do we create an easygoing atmosphere? Through an open-minded perspective on life, self-humor, self-reflection, and self-examination. We should always hold onto this kind of compassionate intention. If we let it go, it will damage our own integrity and diminish our blessings. So, in ancient times, people spoke in a way that did not offend or harm others.

Furthermore, we shouldn’t criticize others. "Not criticizing" is very important. As we mentioned last time, we must make sure our words are clear and think about whether they will be beneficial to us, and whether they will be beneficial to others. If not, then we are indulging in our bad habits, and after speaking, we will regret it, and cause harm to others but not benefit ourselves. Wouldn’t that be foolish? Every word and action we take should be beneficial to both ourselves and others. Why do something that harms others but does not benefit oneself?

When we criticize, it shows that we are arrogant, not self-respecting, and are led by our bad habits. Moreover, we hurt and harm others. In this era, many things are "difficult to know unless you have gone through them yourself." It is not easy to accomplish something good. Many people are proactively contributing, but instead of being praised, they are met with a barrage of criticisms. Isn’t this hurtful to those who have contributed? This is a very bad development, and no one will want to contribute in the future. When people criticize, they will make very wise people appear foolish, and make very difficult things sound simple. They will say, "How could it have turned out like this? If I had done it, it would have been a piece of cake!" Those who say these words truly hurt the contributors because they are not loyal or forgiving. "Not loyal" means those who are truly loyal would have wholeheartedly tried their best, so they would not be criticizing from the sidelines; rather, they would be helping others directly. Why would they say so many critical words? Furthermore, to make things sound so simple means they have not put themselves in another’s shoes, and they are "not forgiving.” "Forgiving" is to understand from another’s perspective and have empathy. Callousness and criticism all stem from a lack of loyalty and empathy. Therefore, criticism has too many negative side effects.

Third, criticism affects the morale of a group. In the military, how do they handle those who affect the morale of the group? The impact of undermining morale is too great. As mentioned earlier, criticism hurts the contributors; also, if you criticize the leader, the whole group will lose cohesiveness and faith in their leader, and the group will immediately fall apart. What kind of people did Confucius think were most despicable? "The most despicable are those who occupy an inferior position but ridicule their superiors." Those who are in a subordinate position and often criticize their leaders have a very bad influence. Or it could be criticizing colleagues. If you criticize a colleague, others will hear it and not trust the colleague, and overall harmony will be broken. Therefore, a single word can destroy a nation. Words of criticism could cause a team to collapse.

Is it easy to build trust? No, it’s not! Is it easy to destroy trust? A few words might destroy it. Therefore, we need to always be mindful of the impact of our words on a group, and we will be cautious.

There is a story in history called "Zeng Zi Kills Someone." One day, someone ran to Zeng Zi's mother and said, "Your son has killed someone! Zeng Zi has killed someone!" Zeng Zi's mother said, "That's impossible! My son has such great moral character, he could not have killed someone." She was completely unmoved. After a while, a second person came and said, "Zeng Zi has killed someone!" Zeng Zi’s mother said, “That’s impossible, my son could not have killed anyone.” But she felt a little uneasy. Then, a third person came and said, “It’s really your son who killed someone!” In fact, it was someone with the same name. But, as a result, Zeng Zi’s mother became a bit anxious and ran out of the house, distraught. When Zeng Zi was not home, when friends visited, Zeng Zi’s mother bit her finger, and Zeng Zi, who was chopping wood in the mountains, felt a pain in his heart, and rushed home. Zeng Zi and his mother had a heart-to-heart connection. That level of trust was affected after hearing the same rumor three times! So, people cannot listen to slander. After hearing it a few times, it will create conflicts between father and son, cause leaders to kill loyal ministers, and cause couples to divorce. Therefore, "Be wary of listening to slander, listening to it will cause misfortune; if the ruler listens, the minister should be executed; if the father listens, the son should be condemned; if spouses listen, they will divorce, and if friends listen, their relationship will be strained." Rumors stop with the wise. Trust is not easy to build, but it can be broken with just a few words.

Furthermore, those who criticize do not understand "organizational ethics." If we feel that there are problems with an organization or team, we should report it upwards. That is the ethics of an organization; otherwise, we will destroy the trust between people. So, people need to understand things, and first they must uphold their roles. They cannot lose their temper and criticize randomly; otherwise, they lose their role as a subordinate or a subject. Those in subordinate positions have the responsibility to advise. If they feel there are problems with their leader, or the organization, they can advise and report upwards. But, absolutely, they cannot criticize everywhere.

Loyal ministers, “families that accumulate goodness are sure to have excess blessings.” However, those who are disloyal to their leader and group will greatly diminish their blessings. *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* says, “fathers and elder brothers in the family, and rulers and leaders in the nation,”. We must respect our leaders in a group and not act arbitrarily and criticize recklessly. Looking back to the Spring and Autumn Period, we see that Bao Shuya recommended Guan Zhong. This is an act of loyalty, so his descendants were all prominent officials for over ten generations. However, if we often undermine the solidarity of a group, this disloyalty will harm our descendants. Therefore, speech truly requires great cultivation.

If you want to deeply study speech, our center's website has a special section on "Cultivating Speech," which you can refer to. The key is to understand if the intention behind what we say is correct. If we speak with emotions, it is absolutely not right. If we speak out of our self-interest, it is also not right, as it is insincere and has ulterior motives. Therefore, our intention must be sincere, and we must always think from the other person’s perspective. We should not be venting or rehashing the past. We might appear to be speaking the principles of the classics, but in reality, we are rehashing the past because we are angry. So, first, we need to understand the intention behind our speech.

Next, the attitude behind our speech should be in alignment with our actions. “A gentleman’s word, once spoken, cannot be taken back, even by a four-horse chariot.” Therefore, speech must be cautious and kind. "Be cautious of excessive talk when navigating the world," first, we should not be impulsive. Those who speak less are more focused and calmer. "The words of the fortunate are few"; "the words of the rash are many." Those who speak in haste will later regret what they said. So, we must think thrice before acting and thrice before speaking. Furthermore, we should speak with a calm and peaceful attitude.

In terms of the method of speaking, *The Standards for Being a Student* says, "Whenever you speak, pronounce each word slowly and clearly, do not be rushed, and do not mumble.” This is the guiding principle of speaking. Many people speak too quickly now, and others cannot hear them clearly and are too embarrassed to ask. Too much talking indicates a restless mind. Talking quickly is also a sign of impatience. Since the purpose of speaking is for the other person to hear us, then, of course, we need to make sure they can hear us clearly. If we speak too quickly, and people start frowning, we should immediately slow down our speech. If we still insist, “that’s just how I speak,” it’s not considerate of the other person. So, our hearts must be gentle, always paying attention to the other person's situation. If they are frowning, it means they are not hearing clearly, and we should slow down our speech.

Therefore, when do we become selfish? In our daily lives, we can see whether or not we are selfish. If we are not thinking of others when speaking, isn’t that selfishness? Sometimes we might think that we’re not being selfish, but if we think carefully, whenever we think of ourselves but not others, that is selfishness.

Including when reminding others of their mistakes, we should be tactful, and make our point without going too far. Don't mention all of their shortcomings at once, making yourself feel good by criticizing them so that they are tongue-tied, or so that they think “I am not done with you yet.” That kind of speaking is too insensitive. We should speak three-tenths of what we know, but never five-tenths, or we are being intrusive. We can speak of seven-tenths of our knowledge, but we should only speak two-tenths of it, so we are not being insincere. The degree of what we say is very important.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow, while also respecting the tone and underlying messages of the original text.

**Translation:**

For instance, in teaching, if students place absolute trust in us, it would be wrong to give them only an eight-tenths effort. If a child is already pouting in anger and we continue to lecture them, that's called clinging [to our own perspective]. Therefore, the concept of "following conditions" is not simple. Our words should be gentle and tactful, not too harsh or direct. These are methods, principles, and guidelines for using language.

This includes timing: praise should be public, while criticism should be private. When pointing out someone's mistakes, we should not do it in front of others, so they don’t lose face or have no way to save face. Criticizing in private allows them to feel that we are considering their feelings in every way, making it much easier to talk to them.

It also includes the idea that "a gentleman admonishes only after trust is established."  They will be receptive to our advice only after they trust us. If we meet someone for the first time and immediately say, “This is wrong with you, that is wrong with you,” it violates human nature and logic. They might misunderstand and think, “Do you just dislike me?” Trust is therefore very important. How do we earn trust? Through actions that inspire respect, by showing consistent care and dedication to them. This is how trust is built. These considerations involve the timing of our speech. It also includes understanding that "when acquaintances are shallow, don’t speak of deep matters." These are all about proper boundaries. When speech understands these boundaries, knowing when to advance and when to retreat, it moves people deeply and inspires respect.

What are the effects of language? The saying “disaster emerges from the mouth” illustrates its impact. “One harsh word can diminish a lifetime of good fortune.” One spiteful word can diminish half of one's good fortune in this life. “A sharp blade cuts the body, but the wound heals; malicious words hurt people, and the hatred lingers.”  A single sentence could cause them to seek trouble from us for a lifetime. We often indulge in fleeting verbal victories, unaware of the long-term repercussions that can be hard to resolve.

Therefore, language is an important practice for self-cultivation. But what is the foundation of self-cultivation? Cultivating the mind. The *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* are all about cultivating the mind. "Be wary of speaking too much; too much talk will always lead to error." It is about maintaining a cautious mind and taming a restless mind, as restlessness is the root of excessive talking. Further, by cultivating a compassionate heart, we will understand to be discreet in our speech, to avoid hurting others or being harsh.

The following passage from the scriptures addresses this:

[Do not rely on power and influence to oppress the lonely and widowed. Do not indulge in greed for food and carelessly kill animals.]

These are all aspects of cultivating a virtuous heart. When we consider others, how can we bully the vulnerable? When we cherish life and cultivate compassion, how can we be greedy and kill animals for food? So every teaching should draw us back to the root—cultivating the mind. This is cultivating from the very foundation, which is true learning. Further, by transforming this understanding into our words and actions, we then practice with virtue. We may understand many principles from understanding just one.  "Be wary of speaking too much" means that our words must be kind and thoughtful, and our actions as well, extending one principle to cover all things.

We previously emphasized benefiting both ourselves and others. Therefore, the teachings of the sages come down to one word—which word? Love. The five-thousand-year culture of our Chinese nation teaches this one word: love. It is a love-based education. It begins with self-love, then extends to loving others. How do we love ourselves? By protecting our pure mind, our compassionate heart, and our true self. Otherwise, we will become more and more contaminated. A one- or two-year-old child laughs an average of 180 times a day, whereas an adult only laughs an average of 7 times a day. People are laughing less as they live, which is an objective fact.

No one strives to not laugh; everyone seeks happiness. But effort doesn't always guarantee positive results. Although no one says they are working toward not laughing, humanity is indeed laughing less and less. In this era, we should slow down our pace and not move too quickly. Why rush along a path that leads to less laughter?

Those who live to laugh more, those who return to simplicity, those who are as innocent as a child in old age – I have met several of them. For example, there's Ms. Xu Zhe of Singapore whom I mentioned before. She has already shared her way to happiness with us. When asked, "How do you live so long?" her reply is “Ha, ha, ha!” She faces life with laughter and optimism. “When one knows contentment in life, worries are removed in an instant.” Contentment brings lasting joy.

Why do people laugh less as they live? Because they crave more and more, ultimately failing to attain it, resulting in endless suffering. The son's education is not as good as another’s, the daughter-in-law earns less than another, the daughter is this or that… Endless comparisons put immense pressure on everyone in the family, sometimes to the point that they don’t want to live. What is family? Family is a place to give love, a place of warmth. How did it become a source of pressure for each other? Competition, vanity, and greed make us exhausted, and exhaust those around us. Self-love is not easy. Only a person with understanding knows how to love themselves; that means constantly letting go of habits of greed, anger, ignorance, and arrogance. If these things continue to grow, that's not self-love.

My teacher is 87 years old, and his laughter is brilliant, as innocent as a baby. He has lived correctly. When looking in the mirror, we can evaluate if we are living right or wrong. Try smiling, does it feel natural? Does it look like the smile of a child?

How can we truly live correctly? “The great learning consists in manifesting clear virtue, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good." Living correctly means restoring to the fullness of wisdom, virtue, and blessings in this life, which is self-love. How do we restore them? The word “restore” is key. These qualities are innate within us, but now there are obstacles. If we remove the obstacles, then we restore ourselves. Greed obstructs blessings; anger and a bad temper obstruct virtue. Regrettable actions are usually done during moments of anger. Ignorance obstructs wisdom. By letting go of greed, anger, and ignorance, we gradually restore “clear virtue.” This is self-love.

A truly wise person will not spend a lifetime pursuing things they cannot take with them. We cannot even take our body with us, and certainly not any material possessions. Why spend decades suffering to pursue that which cannot be carried away? Material possessions are sufficient as long as they meet our basic needs; contentment brings lasting joy. What is most important? To elevate our spirit and our wisdom. Where does wisdom for life lie? In discerning what to take and what to leave. Once when I attended an event, a friend said, "People here are fast in everything.” The streets are crowded, people walk fast. If you don’t move, the people behind will push you along. They're fast in everything, "Except one thing: when it comes to dying, it's slow." They linger for months, even years, attached and unwilling to let go. In the end, they have no choice but to let go, and still, they take nothing.

The *Three Character Classic* says: “People leave their children, chests full of gold.” People without wisdom leave vast properties to their children; “I teach my children, only the classics.” Teaching the classics and virtues becomes a family tradition and demonstrates wisdom.

Therefore, “manifesting clear virtue” is self-love. Moreover, understanding how to benefit our family and those with whom we have a connection in life is loving others. These are the most correct values in life. With these values, how could we "rely on power and influence to oppress the lonely and widowed?" People with influence, because of their position, will "govern for a term, bringing benefit to the region.” How could they possibly bully others? Confucius also taught us, "Do not do unto others what you would not want them to do unto you."  We would not want to be bullied by someone relying on their power, so we should definitely not bully others.  Moreover, orphans and widows are pitiful people who have encountered great misfortune in their lives. They deserve our compassion and care, so how could we oppress, cheat, or harm them? This greatly diminishes virtue and conscience. Such actions are extremely bad, and the karmic consequences will be felt very quickly.

In ancient times, there was a man named Gong Gu in Fangcheng, Henan Province. His neighbor, Zhou, was quite wealthy, but they fell into disaster. The whole family died, except the old grandmother and her young grandson. This was the most tragic thing that could happen to a family. As a neighbor, Gong Gu should have taken care of them, but instead he did not. He cooked a big meal, invited the grandmother and child to eat, and said very nicely, "You are just an old woman and a child. Sell me the rest of your family property cheaply, and I’ll take care of you for the rest of your lives.”  The grandmother trusted him and sold the property cheaply to him. Once he had tricked them, he drove the grandmother and the child away. This is utterly heartless. In less than a year, his family was robbed and killed and all his wealth returned to the grandmother and the child. So, those who do not understand the principles of wealth become petty people. The wealth was destined to be with the grandmother and the child; no one could take it away. “If it is meant to be yours, you will have it; if it is not, then do not force it.” Wealth that is not meant for us, acquired through improper means, is bound to bring misfortune, especially if it involves bullying orphans, widows, and elders.  Such behavior is neither self-love nor love for others, and it diminishes our own blessings. Even if their life is spared, they will live a miserable existence.

Yan Song, a treacherous official from the Ming Dynasty, bullied countless people. Ultimately, because of the hatred he generated, he died in poverty and disgrace. We need to understand, Yan Song was a Prime Minister, an office that is only attained through five generations of accumulated virtue. Yet, he did not know self-love or love for others, squandering all his fortune, and causing his lineage to be cut off – even his own children were executed.

When one has a position or power, it should be used to benefit the community. As the *Standards for being a Good Student and Child* states, for leaders, "When treating servants, one must be dignified; while dignified, one should also be kind and forgiving.” The responsibility of those with blessings is to cultivate and care for others. The *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* teaches us to "have a heart of love and respect." We should always know how to love and respect others. We learn from traditional culture and benefit from the grace of our ancestors and sages; how do we repay that grace? Protecting and respecting everyone is how we repay them. The *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* also says, “Loving and respecting everyone is loving and respecting the sages.” The sages and our ancestors in the spiritual realm will be comforted and grateful to those who love and protect their descendants.

Records in the Twenty-Five Dynastic Histories describe a man whose father took a concubine.  Initially he told his son, "After I die, find a good home for her.”  But as he was dying, he became confused and said, “When I die, let her be buried with me.” That young woman’s life would have ended with his death.  So his son followed his father's clear-minded instructions. Later, when this son was commanding an army and fighting the enemy, the enemy’s commander suddenly fell down and was captured. That night he dreamed that the concubine’s father told him: “You saved my daughter's life, so I caused the enemy commander to fall in order to repay your kindness.” Truly thinking of others, even someone's ancestors are grateful for such kindness.  Therefore “loving and respecting everyone is loving and respecting the sages; knowing what others desire is knowing what the sages desire.” By protecting and helping everyone with whom we have a connection in life, we are truly repaying the grace of the sages and our ancestors.

The virtue of the sages and leaders of past dynasties is that they always first cared for widowers, widows, orphans, the solitary, the crippled, and the sick. “Widowers” are elderly men who have lost their wives; “widows” are elderly women who have lost their husbands; “orphans” are children without parents; the “solitary” are those who live alone without anyone to care for them; the “crippled and sick” are those born with disabilities or suffer from severe illnesses. These are the most pitiful people in the world. Sages and leaders care for them first. When they do this, the entire nation develops a compassionate heart and the society gains more blessings. When parents understand how to help the needy, a compassionate family tradition is established and passed down. When teachers help the needy, the students in the entire class will respect and follow their example, which will help the children develop well-rounded personalities.

Therefore, “Do not rely on power and influence to oppress the lonely and widowed” reminds us not to bully others by relying on our own power, but to understand self-love, and then extend that to loving others.  Having a position or power in life is due to conditions, even perhaps inherited blessings from our ancestors. We should cherish this opportunity to create blessings for future generations. As it is said, "A family that accumulates goodness is bound to have lasting blessings." This also fulfills the trust of those who have placed us in positions of responsibility, including civil servants; it is the country's trust. If civil servants and officials rely on their positions and power to oppress the lonely and widowed, they will cause the people to lose faith in the country, which is a great act of disloyalty and unkindness. Therefore, having a position today is a good opportunity to accumulate merit, establish achievements, and benefit the people. We should cherish this opportunity.

Okay, I'll stop our discussion here for today. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text, striving for accuracy, natural flow, and cultural relevance for an English-speaking audience.

**Lecture 15: Loving Your Family, Extending Kindness to People, and Cherishing All Living Things**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! Last time, we discussed, "Do not rely on power to bully the orphaned and widowed, and do not indulge in gluttony and wantonly kill livestock and poultry." These are indeed key factors in the rise and fall of a family. If these principles are followed, the family will prosper; if they are violated, the family will decline. We must not take a chance with this.

If we look at the beginning of the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims*, "Rise at dawn, sweep and clean the courtyard," does getting up early to do chores have anything to do with the family's prosperity? It has a great deal to do with it. For a family to become wealthy and noble, it absolutely requires diligence. Zeng Guofan said, "A hundred faults arise from laziness." Many of a child's bad habits stem from laziness. The virtues that come from diligence are, conversely, the faults that stem from laziness. This is a key to success or failure.

What are the virtues of diligence? First, physical health comes from regular exercise. Lazy people's muscles are tense due to lack of exercise, making them physically weak. Second, diligent people, by sweeping and cleaning, develop a sense of responsibility; lazy people do not have this sense. Third, when diligent people make an effort, they understand the hardship of the person making the effort. Therefore, learning through labor engenders gratitude. A grateful heart arises from diligence, whereas lazy people have no gratitude. They take everyone's efforts, whether from parents, relatives, or friends, for granted, thus wasting the blessings of their parents and family and diminishing their own good fortune. Fourth, diligent people are able to put themselves in others' shoes, while lazy people cannot. Furthermore, diligent people have good interpersonal relationships, always helping others, as "those who love others are always loved in return." Lazy people are avoided everywhere, shifting their work onto others, resulting in poor relationships. “The time of year is not as good as the geographical advantage, and the geographical advantage is not as good as the harmony of people.” Therefore, lazy people have no social connections.

Fifth, diligent people exercise more, leading to greater ability and mental agility. Therefore, parents and elders who understand the principles will guide their children not to be calculating, but to learn to "suffer losses." Should we teach our children to "suffer losses"? Yes!  "How can my child be allowed to suffer losses?" Suffer loss is a blessing. There is a saying, "Man's calculations are not as good as Heaven's calculations." People who are unwilling to suffer losses are very calculating. They don't realize that human calculation is no match for Heaven's reckoning. People who are willing to suffer losses and take on responsibilities are, in fact, owed by people and will be repaid by Heaven. Their capabilities will be greatly improved. Furthermore, those who understand responsibility are especially favored by leaders. Why would a leader want to have a calculating person as their right-hand man? It makes no sense. Thus, they have good relationships and develop their abilities quickly. Where is the loss? Sixth, a large capacity brings great fortune. Diligent people are not afraid to take on responsibilities, are willing to make an effort, and have a large heart; therefore, they have great blessings. Lazy people are ungrateful, calculating, and unwilling to take on responsibility, so their fortune is small. This is the significance of diligence.

Next, "For every bowl of porridge and every mouthful of food, think of how hard it was to come by," that is, be thrifty. Great wealth comes from destiny, while small wealth comes from diligence and thrift. If one is extravagant, they will not even pass through one generation. I used to teach at a school, and what I saw was not that each generation was worse than the last, but that each year was worse than the previous one. As teachers, we are cultivating talent for the entire society and country. How can I not reflect deeply when I see that each year is worse? How can I accept the taxpayers' money? A teacher's responsibility is to cultivate the next generation well, and parents also have the responsibility to educate the next generation for their ancestors. Now that we see the morality of the next generation declining, parents and teachers cannot help but reflect deeply.

The *Three Character Classic* tells us, "To raise without teaching is the father's fault; to teach without strictness is the teacher's laziness.” Life comes with responsibilities. Parents and teachers both have their divine duty, which is to educate children and students well. A few days ago, a university teacher told me that things weren't just getting worse year by year, but day by day! You can see what they have been witnessing. In universities, people are easily resorting to violence, even causing severe injuries. Why? Because of lack of education. They only see themselves and don't care about the lives of others. Therefore, teaching the next generation about ethics and morality has become very urgent. If you don't teach them, they might get into trouble today, possibly committing an unpardonable error. Now, when we open the newspaper, we see many young people committing terrible atrocities. Can they really not be taught? The problem is that they have not been taught the traditional ethical and moral values! "At the beginning of life, people are inherently good.” "If not taught, their nature will deteriorate." So, we must act quickly and immediately spread ethics and morality.

Therefore, as an elementary school teacher, I realized that the children lacked ethical and moral education. However, when I thought about it more fundamentally, it was not just the students who lacked it, but I myself did not understand ethics and morality either. Therefore, to teach children, one must first teach oneself. Those who teach must first learn. As we learn the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* together, do you feel that every sentence is a key to the rise and fall of a family? If we don’t feel this, will we make them our family rules? Will they become our family heritage? It is likely that we study but still do things the way we always have at home. So, “knowing is difficult, but doing is easy.” What we know we must do. If we don’t, then we don't truly know it. Even though we study, we may think: "Is it really that serious? Is it that important?" In that case, we could study for five or ten years without putting it into practice and therefore never benefit from it.

Therefore, the most important thing about the teachings of the sages is to put them into practice. Only then can we benefit from them. When parents start taking the lead by being diligent, those below will follow suit, and the whole family's destiny will start to change. As long as you are willing to change your own habits, especially to eliminate bad habits, for example by going to bed early and getting up early tomorrow, not staying up late, not sleeping in, the atmosphere in the family will immediately be different. Well, I won't push everyone too hard. The sages' teachings can guide you, but your cultivation depends on you personally.

For example, take this sentence: “Do not rely on power to bully the orphaned and widowed.” If we truly understand “those who possess the Way have much assistance, and those who lose the Way have little assistance," we know that we cannot act against Heaven’s will. Heaven has a love of life. We should use our position and power to act on behalf of Heaven, to take care of others for Heaven. There is a saying in Fujian, "Half of the world is named Chen and Lin." There are many people with the surnames Lin and Chen in Fujian. This is because there was an old woman in Putian, Fujian who was a member of the Lin family. As it says in the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, "An elderly mother was fond of doing good." Although she was rich, she did not bully people. Instead, she made dumplings every day to help poor people who were starving. She did her best to take care of these orphaned and vulnerable people. One person took six or seven every day and ate them for three years. Her compassion was boundless. Later, a Taoist cultivator told her that her kind heart was very sincere and that her descendants would be very blessed. Her descendants would have so many officials that there would be a pile of sesame seeds as high as they would be. My teacher lived in Fujian during the Republican era. Many people with the Lin surname passed the civil service exams. There was even a saying, "No Lin, no passing of exams." This family has been prosperous for hundreds of years since doing good deeds in the Ming Dynasty, there are indeed many offspring like a pile of sesame seeds. This is the power of compassion.

If one bullies others and does so severely, history records that such families all become extinct. For example, Li Si of the Qin Dynasty used his power to kill many people. He designed harsh laws and was eventually sentenced to death by the very laws he had made.

Zeng Zi said, "What goes out from you, returns to you." This means that whatever you say or however you treat others, those words or treatment will eventually come back to you. For example, if you curse someone, you will eventually be cursed. I experienced this most deeply in Muar. There were classes in Muar at the time, and for half a day, we went to the beach to pick up trash. From a distance, we could see many red, yellow, and green colors in the trees by the beach. I thought to myself, "Is Christmas coming early?" But when I got closer, I saw that the trees were covered in trash bags, red and yellow ones all hung on the branches. Many people had thrown their trash into the sea, and then it washed back. I thought of Zeng Zi's words, "What goes out from you, returns to you.” The way of Heaven is to repay; if you do good, good will come to your family; if you do evil, evil will return.

Therefore, “evil has its retribution, and good has its reward; if it doesn't come yet, the time has not arrived.” If we read these sentences with this correct understanding, we will be more aware. We will not only not bully those who are vulnerable, but will also not harm life. For example, when pesticides are invented to kill insects, "What goes out from you, returns to you." Humans originally wanted to kill insects, but in the end, who consumes the most pesticides? Humans! Are humans smart? I don't think so. Humans become smart after studying the classics; otherwise, they will indulge their desires. Many years ago, a report in Taiwan indicated that on average, each person ate 2.7 kilograms of pesticides a year. Now, many farmers are fainting from spraying pesticides because they are too toxic. They do not eat the vegetables that they themselves grow, but eat unsprayed ones instead. They say, "Because the rich people in the city can afford to get sick. We cannot afford to get sick, so we eat this. It is okay if there are bugs.” What if there are bugs? If there are one or two holes in the vegetables, be generous and share them with the insects.

I attended two classes in Yunnan. I met an entrepreneur who had grown one thousand acres of pears, twenty acres of which he dedicated to insects. He was very generous. I saw it with my own eyes. Those twenty acres were all black with bugs. The other places had few bugs. Seeing is believing. A person's sincerity can move others. So, the *Geyan Lianbi* says, "All things resonate with each other.” All species and all lives interact through loyalty and sincerity. Loyalty means trying your best to protect them, and sincerity means treating them sincerely. They will feel it. He communicated with the insects and birds, asking them to eat on those twenty acres. They really only ate there.

I went into those twenty acres and looked carefully, and I saw that the insects and birds were very well-behaved. They would eat one piece of fruit, and eat into the core of the same fruit, without touching the ones next to it. Thus, even though the twenty acres were originally intended for insects and birds, they could still harvest a lot of fruit because the insects and birds would eat the same piece of fruit, leaving the others for them. They are very civilized. Therefore, it can be said that all things have a spirit. When humans understand this truth, and that heaven, earth, and humans are the three components of the world, they should act on behalf of heaven and protect all living things. The more you protect all living things, the more all living things will love you. I think the reason why their other nine hundred acres grow so well is because the birds don’t let the manure fall elsewhere, they are trying to return the favor by fertilizing those fields.

"What goes out from you, returns to you.” The example of Li Si of the Qin Dynasty, who was exterminated, is a case of a family declining. Fan Zhongyan showed compassion towards all beings and became prosperous. He not only did not use his power or status to oppress people, but he also did his best to take care of the people of the world, “Worrying before the world worries and enjoying after the world enjoys." Therefore, his descendants have been prosperous for eight or nine hundred years. A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings left over for future generations. From history, we can deeply understand that these sentences are all keys to the rise and fall of a family. With such confidence and understanding, we can learn each sentence and not take them lightly.

Let's look at the next sentence, which is also critical:

**“Do not indulge in gluttony and wantonly kill livestock and poultry."**

*Wú* (毋) means "do not.” Do not indulge in gluttony, and do not wantonly kill. *Zì shā* (恣殺) means "to indulge in killing” “to kill arbitrarily". *Shēng* (牲) refers to cows and sheep; *qín* (禽) refers to poultry, such as chickens and ducks. The *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* says, "God cherishes life; all creatures cling to life." All living things crave to live and fear death, especially the pain before death. All living creatures are very afraid. One of the most important reasons why I eat vegetarian food is that I was once cutting an orange. The surface of the orange was slippery, so the knife slipped and cut my index finger. At that moment, my scalp went numb. The pain made me run around the room.  The wound was less than one centimeter long, yet it hurt so badly. Suddenly, I remembered a video I had seen of a pig being slaughtered. The knife was directly cutting through the pig's neck and the blood was spurting out. I suddenly remembered that scene. That knife was at least five or six centimeters thick. My wound was less than one centimeter, and it already hurt so much. Since that day, I couldn’t bear to eat meat anymore.

Because I deeply felt that pain, when I reread this section of *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, “Killing them to nourish ourselves, how can we be at peace?” When they are killed, “they are cut and torn.” It’s painful. I remember one scene from that video that left a deep impression on me. A cow had been butchered but was still alive. Its leg had not been completely severed and was still shaking. Then it was hung up with an iron hook. It was very pitiful. After being butchered, it was then put into boiling water, and sometimes they were even boiled alive.

When I returned to the mainland this time, someone told me that his friend had gone to Africa for business. There were many pangolins in Africa. When the locals wanted to show hospitality, they would catch a pangolin for him to eat. They caught a pangolin and it curled up into a ball. They placed it directly on the fire to roast. They roasted it for a long time. Its skin and shell were completely burned, but it still remained curled up. People nearby kept pulling at it, but they couldn't open it up. In the end, they gave up. Since it had not been burned thoroughly, they gave up and caught another pangolin to roast. However, when they put it down, suddenly, the pangolin opened up, and a baby pangolin quickly ran away. It turned out to be a mother pangolin. She had tightly wrapped her baby in her arms to protect it, and had endured being burned all over her body. She was using her last breath to protect her child. After seeing this, the friend could not eat.

So, this story of the pangolin makes us reflect on how all animals cherish their lives. "Do not impose upon others what you yourself do not desire." Mencius taught, "Love your relatives, then extend kindness to others, then extend love to all things." Love your own parents and relatives, and then naturally extend this love to other people's parents and relatives. When we are very respectful of our parents from the bottom of our hearts, when someone says, "Hello, let me introduce you. This is my father, this is my mother," when we hear "father" and "mother," what do we feel? Immediately, that feeling of respect towards our own parents arises. It is very natural. I remember going to a friend’s house, and the friend introduced me to his older sister, and immediately, the feeling of respect for the older sister came naturally. Therefore, the ancients who said these words were people who had been there and understood human nature.

"Love your relatives, then extend kindness to others, then extend love to all things." Everyone is afraid of death; all living beings are afraid of death. Every life has its own ethics. It also has its own parents and children. If we easily kill them, and even separate mothers from their children, what do you think the consequences will be? "As is the cause, so is the effect.” Therefore, we don't understand these principles now. We think, "Why is my life so miserable? Heaven is so unfair." Actually, such a thought still means we do not understand the principles, and it makes our sins even greater. What sin do we add? Complaining about heaven and people. Heaven is so compassionate, yet we often complain. This is sinful.

What are some of the greatest sins? To complain about parents, to complain about heaven and earth, because heaven and earth nourish us, yet we complain about them, this is a very great sin. To complain about teachers and mentors, to complain about leaders who take care of us, to complain about the emperor of the country; these are all quite serious sins. Therefore, the karma that people create today is much greater than what people created in the past, and that is just the karma created by thoughts.

The *Analects* says, "When serving your parents, try to gently persuade them." Persuade when you see things that are not appropriate. "If they will not listen to your good advice," still remain respectful and do not disobey your parents. "Work hard without complaint." Although persuading them repeatedly is tiring, you must not feel any resentment, because our lives come from our parents. Without our parents, where would we be? “Work hard without complaint” is the attitude towards our parents.

*Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says, "Love and respect our elders," and our elders include our parents and elders. “In the family, our fathers and brothers; in the nation, our rulers and leaders; generally speaking, all those of old age,” "high position,” and “high virtue," "and greater knowledge" should all "be treated with even greater care and service." We should be respectful to such elders. “At home, be filial and obedient to your parents, showing them deep love and gentle countenance, with soft words and a humble manner.” Look how tender-hearted people used to be. Now, it is common to give many arguments, so now children don't understand that the father is the sky. They are argumentative and contradict heaven many times each day. How can such children have blessings? If we don’t teach them how to be a person, we do not know how much blessing they are losing. If a teacher does not teach children filial piety, then it cannot be called education, because the foundation has not been grasped. Without a father to support the sky, how can we live without worry? How much trial and pressure does the father endure outside every day? When he returns home, he cannot complain to his children, can he? Fathers are very dignified.

Sometimes fathers do endure too much pressure, and their emotions will fluctuate, or they may lose their temper. As children, we must not be inconsiderate of our father's hardships and pressure. We must not argue back or complain. That is inappropriate. Of course, the mother is important in this situation. She must help the children understand everything that the father endures. Otherwise, today’s children will only criticize and complain, and they will never understand a father’s hardship and heavy responsibility.

After I started earning my own money, my gratitude to my father grew stronger. However, we should not wait until we can earn money before feeling that way. There is a saying, "Only when you raise children do you know the kindness of your parents." However, this is a bit late. By the time you raise children, you are already in your twenties or thirties. The Hokkien saying is, "Only when you are holding your baby in your arms, do you know your parents’ time," which means that only when you hold your own child do you realize that your parents also raised us that way.

Where are people in a pathetic state today? The most obvious phenomena now are that money worship, and the pursuit of fame and fortune have become the goals of life. They are indulgent, indulging their desires. The rate of abortion among young people is too severe, so now it is not only killing animals but also their own flesh and blood. This is too terrible. They don’t understand the principles. Therefore, we must teach our children to abstain from greed and abstain from killing. Abstain from greed, otherwise they will not be able to be honest and upright in the future. "Even if something is small, don’t take it for yourself, because if you do, you will cause your parents pain.” Greed should not be allowed to grow. The ancestors created the word to enlighten us. What word is the most similar to "greed" (貪)? It is "poverty" (貧). Those who are greedy become poorer and poorer, and they will gradually lose their blessings. Furthermore, we must also abstain from killing. If a child does not know how to cherish life from a young age, if they kill insects, birds, and ants, how can that child live a long life? “The benevolent live long.” The unbenevolent, of course, die young. It is not difficult to deduce this principle. We just spoke about money worship and the pursuit of pleasure; what is even more important? Parents need to reflect. Are we also moving in that direction? If we are, our children will definitely follow us. This is not accidental. There is a saying in Northeastern China, “Old cats sleep on the roof; it will be passed down to the next generation.” The values of the older generation are passed down to the next generation, so we must first educate ourselves before we can properly educate the next generation.

The third serious phenomenon is extreme individualism. Who do our children place in the first place now? "Me." Who do they put in second place? "Me." Who do they put in third place? "Me." Is this happening? They are selfish and only think about themselves, not their parents or family. Therefore, our traditional culture must be preserved.

Because I lived with my grandparents since I was young, I know the benefits of three generations living together. I can tell you categorically that without living with my grandparents, I would not have my current attitude towards life, and I would not be so mindful of elders. If you do not live with the elderly, and only go back to see them once every one or two months, how can it become internalized? Unless the parents put in great effort, often taking their children to visit and care for the elders, or often taking them to orphanages and nursing homes to nurture their compassion, it will be very difficult. It is not enough for children to simply hear us speak profound principles; their understanding is not that high yet. What do they need? Personal feeling and experience.

We saw our parents take care of our grandparents like that since we were young. So, I remember when I was in college, I would go home once every month or two, and after putting down my things, the first thing I would do was go upstairs to greet my grandparents. I could also feel that my parents were very happy. Now, I am away from home for even longer periods, but when I return home, I do the same. I go to see my grandfather, who is 95 years old this year. So, I have personally experienced the goodness of three generations living together.

What is even better? Big families are even better.

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and natural flow:

**Translation:**

In the past, large families had at least seventy or eighty members, and often two or three hundred. During the Ming Dynasty, Zheng Lian's family, known as “The Number One Family Under Heaven,” exceeded one thousand people. Nowadays, three people living together will argue; two people will sulk and give each other the silent treatment; and even one person will hit the wall, getting angry with themselves.  Therefore, our attitudes towards life are far worse than those of people a hundred years ago. We shouldn't rashly change the old ways; once changed, trouble arises, because the wisdom of the ancients is far superior to ours.  They preserved it for thousands of years. In the past, people were taught ethics and morals, the Five Relationships and Eight Virtues; now they're no longer taught, and the next generation is a mess.  Previously, talent was chosen based on the core principles of "filial piety and integrity" (孝廉). Today, talent is chosen based on academic credentials, resulting in rampant corruption. We still can't change this. We need to promote filial piety and integrity!  Filial piety is the foundation of virtue, and integrity prevents corruption. We need to grasp the fundamentals of how to live and conduct ourselves. Therefore, the sayings in the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* are eternally unchanging principles that we shouldn’t alter randomly.

We should read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, and, even more importantly, encounter countless people.  Through interactions with people and things, we broaden our horizons, especially by remembering the adage: "When you see someone good, think of emulating them. Even if they are far away, you should gradually approach.” I recently met a filial son in Dalian, Teacher Wang Xihai.  I was deeply moved by his story when I first heard it. He had cared for his stroke-stricken father for over twenty years, until his father passed away at eighty. Before I even met him, a teacher told me that just standing next to Teacher Wang Xihai, without even exchanging a word, made him want to cry. I thought, "Does a filial son have such a strong magnetic field?" Indeed. The *Classic of Filial Piety* says, “The ultimate in filial piety and brotherly love connects with the divine, shines across the four seas, and leaves nothing untouched.” You can feel the immense emotion from that kind of heart.

This time, seeing is indeed better than hearing. I had the opportunity to attend one of Teacher Wang’s lectures. He didn’t quote a single line of scripture during the lecture, yet every word he spoke resonated with scripture. Why did it resonate? Because the classics are the hearts of the sages, expressed in language. As long as his mindset is in alignment with that of the sages, his words will naturally align with the classics.

He talked about caring for his father, saying that he never had a single thought like, “I need to persevere, I need to hold on a little longer; I’m so tired, I’ve been at this for so long.”  He said he didn’t even have the thought of “persevering.”  Having to persevere means already being self-centered: “I’m so tired, I need to persevere, I need to hold on”—that's thinking about yourself.  Therefore, in caring for his father, his own body became stronger. Why?  "To learn and then practice what you have learned, is that not a pleasure?" We might hear about Teacher Wang Xihai’s experience and think, "He must be so tired; he must be exhausted." That's our way of thinking, because we're not someone who embodies true filial piety. When we give a little, we're already reluctant. What about him? He gave everything, fearlessly, without a single thought about himself.  He cared for his father with that kind of mindset.  That's why he was so happy—he was completely in alignment with his innate nature. He said that seeing his father sleeping peacefully made him incredibly happy, because life came from his father.  He said that the moment a child starts thinking: “I’ve already given so much, how much longer do I have to keep going?” That’s when complaints begin to surface, and the heart starts to change.

Therefore, a filial child only has parents in their heart; nothing else. Their every thought is about how to make their parents happy and comfortable.  All the stories of the Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety are just like this.  Take, for example, “Zilu Carries Rice.” We might imagine Zilu carrying rice, walking hundreds of *li* (a Chinese unit of distance), with the rice being so heavy, and wonder how hard it must have been for him to walk and breathe.  But what about Zilu? He didn’t experience any hardship. He carried the rice happily, thinking, "Finally, my parents will get to eat white rice!” He didn't think, “I’m so tired, I’m so exhausted.” Where does hardship and exhaustion come from?  They come from selfishness and self-centeredness, from thinking about “me.” When there is no "me," those feelings don’t exist.

Later, Zilu became a high-ranking official. He was presented with lavish food, but he couldn't eat it, and tears streamed down his face. "My parents have already passed away; they can't enjoy this food," he thought, "I wish I could go back to when I was carrying rice for hundreds of *li*, but I can’t." Filial children throughout history have been the same, including the story of “Qian Lou Tastes Feces.” He had achieved great success as an official—fame and fortune, things that most people find hard to give up. In today's society, who is in charge? Whoever makes the most money in the family. Even parents and elders have to give them face. "He's busy with business" is a seemingly reasonable excuse for not visiting their parents for a long time. If one son or daughter brings home more money than the others, they talk particularly loudly and are arrogant toward their parents. But what about the ancients? Qian Lou dreamt that his father was ill—just a dream, not yet confirmed—but as father and son are connected at heart, he immediately resigned from his official position and rushed home as quickly as he could. Indeed, his father was ill. The doctor said that whether his father would live could only be determined by tasting his feces; if it was bitter, there was hope; if sweet, there was probably no hope. As soon as the doctor finished speaking, Qian Lou immediately tasted the feces. He didn't think about himself; did he think it was dirty? He didn't have that thought. The result was sweet, and that very night, he prayed to heaven, offering his own life to his father.

Teacher Wang Xihai was in his twenties or thirties, the prime time to build a career. But he had no other thoughts. He wholeheartedly cared for his father.  And in caring for his father, he was able to discern his needs simply by observing his expression. Once, his father had a high fever, and doctors couldn’t find the cause. Wang Xihai dreamt of himself falling off a ladder. Even his dreams were connected to his father. After waking up, he realized that falling off a ladder meant an injury to the foot. He immediately examined his father's feet carefully, and indeed, he found a small abscess.  That was the reason for the fever. If the cause hadn't been found, his father might have died.

Therefore, the ultimate in filial piety and brotherly love can truly make a connection. He would help his father clear his phlegm.  We can just imagine the action and think it's difficult, right?  Inserting a suction tube, worrying about accidentally touching his father's trachea. But this filial son’s soft heart allowed him to perform the action with precision, grasping the right timing to suck the phlegm out. This was because he feared that phlegm would suddenly block the trachea, causing his father to suffocate. His mother sighed, saying, “Even I could never have done that for my husband.”

Teacher Wang Xihai's father had smooth skin even after twenty years of illness. Once, a doctor who examined his father asked how long he'd had the stroke. He replied, "More than twenty years.” The doctor became angry because he thought: "It's impossible for a stroke patient to have such skin after twenty years; you're lying to me!" Later, this doctor checked his father’s medical records. After seeing them, he was moved to tears, saying, “Your ability to care for your father could be a lesson for nurses in our hospital. How could his skin be this smooth?"  This was because Teacher Wang Xihai would turn his father over every half hour at night. How did he do it?  With a filial heart, he had the means. The key was his focused intention.  He had figured out a way to put his hand under his father’s lower back, which created an indentation because his father weighed eighty kilograms. His father’s weight would then press against his hand and cause it to go numb after around half an hour, waking him up, and reminding him to turn his father over. Bedsores are excruciating for bedridden patients and prevent them from sleeping well at night. He felt that allowing his parents to develop bedsores would be a disgrace and unfilial act, showing a lack of care and empathy.  His method was something he discovered on his own. Why? Because every thought he had was for his father’s well-being.

He was also deeply saddened at the hospital to see children doing nothing when their fathers had not defecated for three or four days, just waiting to see what the hospital would do. Taking parents to the hospital is seen as a sign of filial piety, just like giving money. But where is filial piety actually expressed? Do you empathize with your parents’ feelings? That is true filial piety. If you could understand your parents’ suffering, you’d feel how uncomfortable it would be if they hadn’t defecated for three or four days, and you’d take immediate action. Despite the doctors and nurses not doing anything, he would start massaging his father’s stomach to aid peristalsis, use hot towels, and apply hot compresses to the anus. Eventually, his father defecated. The stool landed on his hand, and he was extremely happy because his father had finally been relieved of his discomfort. The ability to hold one's parents’ feces and urine in your hands is a blessing, as we are paying back the debt of our parents who fed us and cared for us with every bowel movement and diaper change when we were young. This is the greatest of blessings.

I’m also grateful to my mother. When my maternal grandfather was sick, my mother, my aunts, and my great-aunts took turns caring for him. Sometimes, he would have bowel or urinary incontinence.  At these times, my mother and my aunts would say, “To be able to hold my father's waste is a blessing, a chance to repay his kindness.” When our parents took care of our diapers as babies, they didn’t find us disgusting, and they felt joy seeing that we had a normal bowel movement.  We should feel the same way about taking care of our parents.

I feel that Heaven is very kind to us. It seems many good things have come my way. That day, a former classmate, Teacher Zheng, met Teacher Wang Xihai in person and thanked him.  She said, “I took care of my father in the same way, helping him have a bowel movement, after hearing your lecture about how to care for parents.” Her father hadn't previously been interested in traditional culture. After she had cared for her father with all her heart, her father told her before he passed away, “I’ll do whatever you want me to do.” He was incredibly moved by her dedicated care. “From now on, I'll eat whatever you want me to eat, and I'll do whatever you want me to do.”

The classics say, “Filial children are never wanting, and are forever blessed.” (孝子不匱，永錫爾類)  The things I've encountered confirm that the classics speak the truth. A truly filial child’s acts of filial piety will never cease. Instead, they will continue to spread and influence generations to come. The word “*xi*” (錫) is similar to the word “*ci*” (賜), which means “bestowing upon.” This refers to bestowing blessings upon humanity and future generations. Why? His filial heart moved the people of his time, making them start to understand filial piety. And that brings good fortune.  I often read the stories of the Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety, and I’m moved to tears. Therefore, when we are troubled, if we read these stories, our troubles will vanish.  A sense of shame will arise because we see that we fall so far short of them.  Teacher Wang Xihai’s example has already inspired many to practice filial piety. Isn’t that truly "forever blessed?" And after that lecture, the group attending the course were a hundred or so school principals and kindergarten teachers. I was overjoyed! Why?  I didn't just see a hundred or so school principals and kindergarten teachers. I saw one or two hundred thousand students, because they are responsible for so many students—some have hundreds, others have thousands. If they all embrace traditional Chinese culture, wouldn’t one or two hundred thousand students benefit?

Therefore, I tell my colleagues that being able to promote traditional culture is truly a blessing!  It's not easy to connect with such a vast number of people in other fields of work.  Also, we should make many vows. If the vows are genuine, they will surely attract good opportunities in the future. I once gave a lecture at a women’s prison in Taoyuan, Taiwan.  It was a profound experience. The inmates there are referred to as “classmates” in Taiwan. While I was lecturing, a child was also present.  Because the inmate was pregnant when she entered the prison, the child was born and raised there.  It was heartbreaking.  Yet, for the two hours of my lecture, they listened with rapt attention. Why was it so profound for me? If her parents, her kindergarten teachers, her elementary school teachers, and the teachers through all her growing up years had taught her ethics and morals, would she be here today? No.

They made mistakes. Families, schools, and society need to reflect on how we didn't teach them how to be good people.  They listened with rapt attention for two hours. Sometimes I even doze off when I attend lectures, so I am even worse than they are.  Later, I told them, "If you can maintain the same attitude towards learning that you have today, becoming a saint or a sage in this life would not be difficult."  They were all very happy when they heard that. I encouraged them with the words: “Do not degrade yourselves, do not give up on yourselves; you can become saints or sages through diligent practice." My experience at that time made me feel so sorry for them.  If these prisoners could all encounter traditional culture, it would be wonderful. That thought occurred to me.

A few years later, I became involved in the endeavor to bring traditional culture into the prison system in Hainan Province. The experiences in Hainan Province were later compiled into a textbook which was used in prisons throughout China.  We have contributed to this effort.  If you have a sincere aspiration, it will certainly be achieved. “People with good aspirations, Heaven will surely assist.”  Laozi said, “Heaven does not favor anyone, but always favors the good person.” Therefore, everyone should be courageous in making vows.

Before, when I gave lectures at universities, the students also listened with rapt attention. I hope that more people will give lectures at universities.  

As it happened, in October 2012, we had the opportunity to be invited to give lectures at universities. Those lectures were then recorded and became videos that are now circulated on university campuses. This has fulfilled my aspiration. Therefore, good aspirations can be fulfilled. We must be courageous in making vows.

Just now, we spoke about respecting life and respecting animals, not separating mothers from their offspring.  If we can truly understand what was written in the *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, we would not want to harm life. "Killing them to nourish oneself; how can that bring peace?  Furthermore, when they are killed, they are not only butchered", some are still alive when put into the pot for cooking, “The pain goes through their very bones.”  Today, when we eat delicacies, the taste disappears as soon as it passes our tongues.  In fact, nutritionists have now discovered that the nutrients in vegetarian food far exceed those in meat, and meat today is full of toxins. For the sake of our health, we shouldn't eat meat frequently. "Vegetables and simple soup can satisfy our hunger." Why kill them and damage our own good fortune?

Okay, I'll stop here for today. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text from Chinese to English:

**Lecture 16: Cherishing the Lives of Creatures is Cherishing Oneself**

Respected elders and friends, good day to you all! Last time, we studied the following passage together:

【Do not be greedy for the palate and recklessly slaughter livestock and fowl.】

Every line in the *Zhu Zi Family Precepts* has the potential to influence the rise and fall of a family. If they are valued, the family will prosper; if they are disregarded, the family may decline.

Last time, we discussed how cherishing life brings the good karmic reward of longevity. It is said, "The benevolent live long."  A benevolent person's thoughts are for others and for life, so their mind and body are definitely healthy.  The classics tell us a very important truth: "As is the cause, so is the effect." Planting good causes yields good results; planting bad causes yields bad results. The principle of cause and effect is an unchanging truth in the universe. For example, in school, studying diligently is the cause, and achieving good grades is the effect. Respecting teachers and focusing in class is the cause, and significant learning gains are the effect. Respecting and caring for parents now is the cause, and future blessings are the effect.

Cultivate the field of blessings. There are three major types of these fields: the field of gratitude (恩田), which means never forgetting the kindness of parents, elders, teachers, and even ancestors. Like today, we are reading the *Zhu Zi Family Precepts* together. It seems quite easy, but in fact, if it hadn't been passed down through generations, this text might have been lost. So, it's not easy to have the opportunity to read this text!

The only civilization, culture, and history in the world that has endured for five thousand years is that of the Chinese nation. In Southeast Asia, we see that many of the next generation of Chinese in Malaysia are still able to read Chinese. This is also thanks to the efforts of such sages as Mr. Lim Lian Geok and Mr. Sim Mow Yu, who risked everything, even their lives, to preserve and pass down Chinese education. In Indonesia, most of those who can understand Chinese are only the elderly, in their sixties and seventies. So, we in this generation who can understand Chinese and delve into its five thousand years of wisdom should also be grateful. When we approach learning with such a grateful heart, the effect is different.

The field of compassion (悲田), means having pity for others and for all living beings. The field of respect (敬田), means respecting sages, elders, and even all things, and practicing thrift and cherishing objects. These all bring blessings.

Additionally, there are three truths about cause and effect that are very important for our lives. I ask everyone, do you hope to have wealth? Do you like to be intelligent and wise? Do you like to be healthy and live a long life? Yes, we do. During the New Year, we often say auspicious greetings, such as: "May you have peace year after year and may everything go as you wish." But peace year after year and may everything go as you wish are results. If we do not plant good causes, how can we get good results? Sages teach us, "Destiny is shaped by our actions, and blessings are sought through our efforts." We all hope to have wealth, wisdom, and good health and longevity. Then the causes we cultivate should be: giving wealth, which results in wealth. The most obvious example in history is Fan Li (also known as Tao Zhu Gong) of the Spring and Autumn Period. He “accumulated wealth three times and scattered it three times.” He is revered as one of the gods of wealth of the Chinese people because he understood the true cause of wealth.

Giving the Dharma, means sharing our wisdom and experience selflessly, which results in intelligence and wisdom. My teacher, Professor Shi Jing Kong, has been teaching for 55 years. He is now 87 years old.  Many heads of state consult him on matters of governing their nations, and he is able to answer them immediately. His wisdom is extremely high. We can experiment with this in our own lives as well.  Once, when I was in a teacher training class preparing for an exam, my teacher instructed us to do our best to help others.  At that time, some classmates had math problems they couldn't solve and came to ask me.  Because my teacher had taught us this, we needed to listen and do our best to help our classmates. It turned out that the more I helped my classmates with math, the more my own understanding improved. It was as if my own level had to go from being someone who solves problems to someone who guides others on how to solve them, so my understanding had to improve greatly. After four months of giving in this way, I scored 88 points on the math exam in the first year; I didn't prepare in the second year and still scored 90 points; the third year I didn't prepare much either because I was busy substituting and teaching twenty plus classes. Still, I scored 88 points. Because we help others, our understanding and intelligence improve. Therefore, there is no loss in this world. Those who are willing to give and take losses will be helped by heaven.

Giving fearlessness, means not causing people or animals pain, but rather allowing them to have health and well-being, which results in our own health and longevity. "Giving fearlessness" means to not cause fear. Ms. Xu Zhe, a national treasure of Singapore, lived to the age of 114. She did her best to help others, so she was blessed with health and longevity. She built many nursing homes, and she had been vegetarian since childhood. As soon as she ate meat, she would have an allergic reaction. Because eating meat requires the slaughter of animal lives, being a vegetarian itself is also an act of giving fearlessness, so it brings health and longevity. My teacher, for example, has been vegetarian for over 60 years and is in very good health. These are all good examples. And so, the principle of "planting causes brings results" is very clear to us.

And if we go against these three types of giving: being stingy results in poverty; not sharing good wisdom and experience with others leads to ignorance; harming life may result in misfortune for ourselves or our family.

There is a true story from a small town in Taiwan. An old man lived there and kept a female dog named Hali. This dog became pregnant. Dogs are very loyal. Even though she was about to give birth, she followed her owner when he went to the woods to clear weeds. On the way back, halfway there, this female dog went into labor. She couldn't help herself so she found a riverbank and gave birth to seven puppies. Her owner couldn't find her and didn't know where she had gone.

After giving birth to seven puppies, the mother dog needed to nurse them. She couldn’t produce milk if she didn’t eat. The instinct to cherish their children is not only human, but all animals are like this. So animals cherish their lives, their families, and their offspring.  If we harm their lives or their loved ones, it is the most painful thing for them. Hali, having given birth to seven puppies, dragged her weary body in search of food, eventually finding her way to the home of a man named Wuxiong.

It just so happened that it was the second day of the second lunar month, the birthday of the local Earth God (Tudigong). Wuxiong and his wife had prepared offerings to worship the Earth God. They hadn’t yet taken them to the temple when Hali, smelling the aroma of the food, entered and took the offerings. Wuxiong and his wife returned home to find that the items they were going to use for worship were gone. They were very angry because they didn't have time to buy more.  Anger arose in their hearts.  Sometimes when we can't control our temper, it will lead to bad consequences. So the next day they prepared food and placed it on a chair in the kitchen. Then they closed all the doors and windows, leaving only one small window open.  When Hali entered again, wanting the food, the couple quickly closed the small window. They took sticks and beat the mother dog until she was unconscious.  Their anger was out of control. They threw the unconscious Hali into the stove fire and burned her alive. So when people can't control their anger, they can commit very cruel acts. The mother dog wailed inside the stove and eventually died. With the mother dog dead, the seven puppies also starved to death. Eight lives were lost.

This man Wuxiong had five children. The eldest son was a backhoe operator, the second son worked in a factory, the third daughter was also a factory worker, the fourth son was a freshman in college, and the fifth son was in high school.  The family was very happy at first, but on the seventh day after the mother dog was burned to death, Wuxiong’s eldest son was operating a backhoe on a mountain road when the soil suddenly gave way and the backhoe flipped into the valley below. The eldest son was killed. Wuxiong's family was heartbroken.

Seven days later, on February 16th, the second son was riding his motorcycle home from work when he accidentally crashed into a tree and suffered a serious concussion. He was taken to the hospital, but died. With two sons dying in succession, the whole family was shrouded in grief, with no way to recover. Several days later, the third daughter, unable to resolve a romantic conflict, committed suicide by taking poison. The fifth son was bitten by a poisonous snake on his way home from school in the evening. He was taken to the hospital, but it was too late, and he died.  Within a single month, four young, promising children died tragically one after the other.  Of course the parents were distraught, grieving for their children who had passed before them.

And in fact, while this couple was experiencing such pain, let’s consider, isn't their pain the same as the mother dog who was thrown into the fire while thinking about her seven starving pups?  They were experiencing the same pain.

Following this, Wuxiong's wife could not bear the severe family tragedy, and eventually she hanged herself. So, five people died in their family.  Wuxiong, of course, was grief-stricken. Someone reminded him that perhaps he had harmed too many lives. He thought about a month before when he killed a dog. Then someone reminded him that the mother dog had puppies. He went looking nearby and found the remains of the seven puppies. He realized that he had committed the sin of killing eight lives.

Confucius told us, "Essence becomes matter, and roaming spirits transform." The body is where the soul resides. When the body is broken and can no longer be used, the soul will find another body. This is true of humans, and it is also true of animals. So, an animal’s soul will also hate and seek revenge. Harming life will definitely not bring us any good.

Wuxiong truly understood the sin he had committed and repented. He buried the remains of the puppies and also did some good deeds to bring them blessings. Later, he and his son, who was in university, were safe and sound. Now, this father and son are still alive and they advise people not to kill. This is a true story that happened in Taitung, Taiwan. We now understand what sins an angry heart can create. It is truly difficult to imagine.

Let’s look at an example from America. In New Mexico, there was an old man who hated mice. One day he caught a mouse in his house, and unable to control his anger, he wanted to kill it. There was a pile of burning leaves outside the house, so he threw the mouse into the fire. The mouse was on fire, but it immediately broke free from the fire. Then, what did the mouse do? It ran back into the man's house, and the entire house caught fire and was completely burned to the ground.

Therefore, our ancestors often said, "Revenge breeds revenge, and it never ends." It's not just people who seek revenge against each other; if you burn a mouse, the mouse will also seek revenge.

Let's look at a positive example. Thirty or forty years ago, in Tangshan, China, a family had a mouse in their house. They did not harm the mouse but actually treated it well. Sometimes they would leave food for it.  Because of this, the mouse never bit anything in their house and was not afraid of people. One night, the mouse started frantically squealing. It squealed so much that they couldn’t sleep. They didn't know what was going on. Seeing that they didn't do anything, the mouse jumped onto their beds and bit them. The owner became angry, thinking, "We have taken care of you all this time, and now you are biting us?" They took things to hit the mouse. They chased and chased the mouse. The mouse was squealing, running, and biting them until they were exhausted. The mouse led them all outside.  At that moment, a major earthquake struck and the entire house collapsed. At that time, many people were crushed to death, but the whole family survived. This is a story that everyone in the local area knew.

Why did the mouse know first?  I ask everyone, during an earthquake, what kind of animal knows last? Why is it that humans are the slowest to sense it? Because humans have the most desires, and their innate sensitivity becomes weaker and weaker.  We see that harming life results in your whole house being burned, and cherishing life results in your whole family being saved. Therefore, our ancestors said, "What you do not want for yourself, do not do to others" and what you do not want for yourself, do not do to animals.

Confucius said, "If you understand one, you must understand three." These are all worthy of our reflection. Especially Zeng Zi said: “What comes out of you will return to you.” If we curse others today, others will curse us back sooner or later. If we hit others today, others will hit us back sooner or later. If we harm life today, sooner or later our own life will suffer misfortune. If we offer love and compassion today, sooner or later that love and compassion will return to us. Therefore, "the way of heaven is to repay,". Those who truly understand this principle will never have evil thoughts, say evil words, or do evil deeds.

The phrase "Do not be greedy for the palate and recklessly slaughter livestock and fowl," is about how the desires of the palate are very fleeting, but harming life "will bring future misfortune to a family that is not virtuous." If we observe calmly, those who hunt, and their offspring, rarely live long. For example, in the Tang Dynasty, there was a man named He Ze. He was very domineering, just like the previous line stated, "Do not rely on power to bully the lonely and weak."  He would bully people and liked to eat chicken, duck, fish and meat. He raised thousands of chickens and ducks in his own home, and he had to eat them every day. One day he was cooking chicken, and as he was cooking it, his only child walked to the side of the pot and suddenly fell into it. When the family pulled him out, the only son had been boiled and was destroyed. He was left without any descendants. This is a record from the Tang Dynasty. This sentence from the *Book of Changes* is really worthy of our consideration. As long as we do good, the family will prosper. It is said, "The home that accumulates goodness is sure to have blessings." If we do evil, "The home that accumulates evil will surely have misfortune."

Another story is about a hunter in Jiangbei who shot a goose. This goose was a male goose. The hunter started cooking the male goose. Halfway through cooking, he opened the lid.  A female goose that had been circling in the sky, seeing the pot lid open, flew very quickly directly into the boiling hot pot and died with the male goose. People who saw this were very moved.  They felt that even animals had such strong loyalty. After this incident spread, the people of Jiangbei did not want to eat goose meat. There was a scholar named Yuan Haowen who bought the two geese, and buried them together. Such loyalty is indeed worth learning from. The burial place was called Yan Qiu (Goose Mound). Not long after, the goose shooter also died.  Giving fearlessness results in health and longevity, while killing two lives shortens one’s own life. This was all for the sake of the palate.

And if we think about it calmly: We eat to be healthy, that’s the most important purpose. If we eat more vegetables and less meat, the world’s forests will not be destroyed so quickly in order to raise cattle, sheep, and other livestock.  It’s because the amount of meat people eat is too great now that the destruction of nature is getting worse and worse. In the past, people only ate meat three to five times a year. Now, people eat several kinds of meat in one meal. The burden on the Earth is very great. If we can eat less meat and more vegetables, we are doing our part to protect the environment.

We often say that we should follow the Way of Nature. Think about it: Are humans naturally structured to eat meat, or to eat vegetables? If we look at nature, we see that herbivores have small intestines that are four to five times the length of their spines. Food takes two to three days to pass through them. Humans have small intestines that are four to five times the length of their spines. Carnivores have very short small intestines, because if that meat remains in the intestines for two to three days, it would stink horribly. Therefore, meat-eating animals have short intestines.  Humans have intestines that are made for eating vegetables.

Next, what do the teeth of meat eaters look like? Look at tigers and lions. Have you ever seen people with two protruding teeth like that? The teeth for eating meat are the canines, used for tearing meat. Human teeth are structured to bite vegetables, grains, and cereals. This is from a physiological perspective.

Also, we should try our best not to do business that is related to harming life. In fact, if a person is truly blessed, they will make a lot of money in any industry. Why? What is destined in one's life will surely come. If you plant good causes and are diligent in your work, then you will have good results. So people who are not blessed will not make money in any industry. But people who are blessed don’t need to worry, they are certain to make money.  If the industry we choose to work in is harming too much life, then it's likely we will lose some of our blessings. Therefore, the ancients said: "A gentleman loves wealth but gains it through proper means.”  Heaven has a love for life. We should choose a business that aligns with this love of life.

There is a roasted duck restaurant in Taipei with a very good business. People have to line up for several hours to buy their roasted duck. It was that popular. One year during the New Year holiday, business was so good that they didn’t close, and the lines became even longer. The boss came to the restaurant and was very happy when he saw so many people lining up. He walked around the shop, smiling. Then, suddenly, he collapsed, shaking his arms and legs, twitching and in great pain. The customers said that he was turning with his arms open like a duck. They were all so scared that they ran away and no longer dared to buy his food.  His wife rushed him to the hospital, where he was in critical condition for three days and three nights. He bled from all seven orifices and died. This is the story of the owner of a roasted duck restaurant. These are all worthy of our consideration, not to form bad karmic ties with life.

When I was a child, my mother told me stories like how the person who killed dogs would bark like a dog before dying. These are things she had seen. I myself had a personal experience. There was a wet market near my home. There was a man who sold chickens. One day, when I went to the market with my mom, I was frightened when I passed a stall where chickens were sold. The face of the owner of the stall was seven or eight parts like a chicken’s, even his nose drooped down. The image is deeply ingrained in my memory.  So, we should not create bad karma with people or any other forms of life.

So, we must teach our children to abstain from killing. When they harm small lives, they will diminish their blessings. If they cherish life, they will increase their lifespan.

There was a young novice monk whose teacher saw that he was not going to live much longer. The teacher even chose a good day for him to go home so he could have a reunion with his parents. But later, the novice monk returned. His teacher was very surprised. How did he prolong his life? Later, he lived a long life and even became very accomplished in his studies. His teacher asked him, “What happened when you went home?” He said, “On the way home, it was raining very heavily, and the water was rushing.  The water had broken an anthill. Thousands of ants were about to drown. In a moment of panic, the novice monk took off his robe and spread it over the anthill to save all of the ants. He had saved tens of thousands of lives, so he prolonged his life.

Harming life, however, has consequences. In the Kangxi period, there was a Yuzhu Pagoda three li outside Dongguan in Kunshan County. A child would often climb the pagoda to steal bird eggs. He would play with them and eat them. He harmed many bird eggs. Harming bird eggs also breaks up the families of these birds. The pagoda was right next to the river. Boats would often pass by for business. Once a boat from Taicang passed by, and the child went to steal eggs. Suddenly, he lost his footing and fell. He somersaulted three or four times in the air before hitting the ground. When the people on the boat came closer, they saw that his bones were all crushed.

When I read this, I felt a chill down my spine. Why? Because when I was little I would climb trees to catch beetles. I also harmed many lives. Luckily, my ancestors were virtuous. I didn't somersault three or four times when I fell from a tree. However, I also got my karmic retribution. I did fall from a tree and a piece of glass went right into my artery, and I lost a lot of blood. I harmed too many animals in the past, so I lost many blessings.  Once I understood, I started accumulating merit.

Children must be taught not to kill, and to develop their compassion. The compassion of parents will protect their children. If parents often harm life, they may bring misfortune to their children.

Another true story: There was a woman in Hangzhou who was very fierce. She would often burn ants with fire and block the wormholes with lime so that the worms would die inside. She gave birth to a son. One day she went out. Her child may have been sleeping. She was only gone for a short while. When she returned, she saw a big black blob on her bed.  When she looked closer, she found that her child had been bitten to death by a swarm of ants. She lost her son and cried bitterly. Finally, she herself died suddenly. This is a case of misfortune affecting descendants.

So, we really need to understand the truth from these stories: all life has a spirit, and all beings have feelings. They will feel pain, and when they feel pain, they will seek revenge. When we cherish them, of course, they will reciprocate. We should not underestimate small lives. When we watch TV shows that investigate them, we see that ants are very intelligent, they have family organizations and group organizations. They have very detailed divisions of labor, and they are also intelligent. If you harm them, of course they will seek revenge.

Another story from ancient times: There was a person who made wine. In the process of making wine, many flies would fall into the wine and die. He had a compassionate heart. He quickly scooped them out and released them.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow that would be suitable for a book:

**The Importance of Respecting Life**

Therefore, if we are mindful in all our actions, we can avoid harming living beings. The Taoist tradition tells us, "Even insects and plants should not be harmed.”

There was a time when a man was falsely accused and sentenced to death. The county magistrate was about to finalize his judgment when a swarm of flies flew in and prevented him, repeatedly. In ancient times, officials were scholars who had studied the classics and understood that all things have a spirit. Therefore, such strange occurrences were seen as omens. This prompted the magistrate to re-examine the case, and ultimately, the man was exonerated. Because he had been kind to the flies, they ultimately saved his life. These stories are included in Mr. Li Shutong’s *Protecting Life Drawings* (李叔同先生), later known as Master Hongyi (弘一大師), which was compiled in the early years of the Republic of China.

The Taoist tradition emphasizes health and longevity, and therefore strongly advises against killing, especially "killing turtles and hitting snakes,” as turtles and snakes can sometimes live for thousands of years. We ourselves have experience releasing turtles, and their spiritual awareness is very high. When released, they often shed tears, and after being set free, they keep looking back. I saw online videos of fish being released, and after they were put into the water, they began to dance. They moved in an orderly fashion in the water, forming neat patterns, which was their way of expressing gratitude to the people who released them. Not long ago, some of our colleagues released fish, and they performed a dance for us as well. This is how animals show their appreciation.

The Twenty-Five Histories (二十五史), which are China's official histories, are absolutely factual. History, in fact, is a true account of cause and effect. During the Jin Dynasty, there was a general named Mao Bao (毛寶). One of his soldiers saw someone selling a small white turtle, only four or five inches long, by the road. Filled with compassion, he bought and released it. Many years later, during a battle, the army was defeated. The soldier, unwilling to become a prisoner, jumped into the river. Soon after, he felt something supporting him from below. It was a large white turtle, five or six feet long, the very same turtle he had released years before.

Isn’t this story incredibly amazing? That turtle didn't have GPS; how did it know to save the person who released it and to be there at the exact time he fell in the river? How could it be such a coincidence? There are many things in this world that our minds cannot fully comprehend. These things are connected.

Recently, in Beijing, someone was not feeling well. A friend suggested that eating baby eagles would improve their health. But I ask you, does eating baby eagles really lead to better health? Acts of selfless giving result in health and longevity, so how can harming life possibly lead to longevity? It’s not in accordance with the truth. People without discernment do foolish things. He actually followed his friend's advice and caught baby eagles to eat. The mother eagle then attacked the person who ate the eagles and the person who gave the advice. How amazing is that? How did the eagle know who had given the advice? Did the person have a sign on their forehead saying, "I suggested it"? The person who gave the advice told this story themselves. The eagle kept attacking them and they were bewildered, saying, "I didn't eat the eagles, why is it attacking me?” They realized eventually it was because they gave the advice.

Therefore, we should not harbor evil thoughts, nor should we let our thoughts run wild, because every thought creates a magnetic field. Humans have magnetic fields. Years ago, when taking pictures, a flash would sometimes show white light, indicating a good magnetic field. If the picture showed black, misfortune might be coming. People have magnetic fields; it’s real, not fake. We can't see it because we are too insensitive.

In ancient times, there was a man who was blessed with good fortune. His wife often saw a glow above his head. One evening, when he returned, the glow was gone. His wife asked, “The glow is gone, what did you do today?” He replied, "My friend wanted a divorce, and I helped him write the divorce papers." “You must get them back immediately!” she said. “What will happen if they get divorced tomorrow?” He hurried to get the papers back and the light returned. “It is better to break ten bridges than to destroy one marriage.” Breaking up a family affects future generations. We should instead encourage people to be loyal, to be grateful, and to live in harmony with their spouses. So ancient and modern examples, both in China and abroad, have shown us these truths. That story was a reminder not to harm turtles.

Also, we should not harm snakes. There was a wealthy man who had a very large dead tree near his home. He planned to cut it down. That night, he dreamt that someone asked for a few days’ grace to move their family before he cut it down. The next day, he sent people to climb the tree. They found many snakes inside the dead tree. However, instead of showing compassion, he became cruel and set the tree on fire, killing many lives. Soon after, his own house caught fire, and his entire family was burned to death; none survived. The ancients recorded these stories for us to reflect on, leaving these principles for us to remember: "What you send out, will return to you.” By annihilating an entire snake family, the karmic consequence was inevitably negative.

Therefore, we should encourage children to abstain from killing as early as possible. I only understood this in my twenties, and as soon as someone advised me, I listened. Now I also try to redeem my wrongs. The earlier we can share stories about cherishing life with children, the more willing they will be to protect life and the less likely they will be to harm it. Thus, elders and parents should know many such stories, and whenever the opportunity arises, tell them to their children.

We are discussing the importance of not harming life when a friend asks: "If mosquitoes and cockroaches appear in the home, and these beings have souls, what are some ways to deal with the cockroaches?”

An American wrote an article based on his own experience. He and his wife were discussing how to kill the flies in their home, when their very young child overheard. The child’s innate compassion was strong. He immediately wrote a letter, asking the flies to leave, fearing that they would be killed. He then taped the letter next to the window and opened the window. Amazingly, the flies flew out. His parents found the letter. Thus, all things can be connected through genuine sincerity and integrity. If we are genuine and truly care for them, there will be a response.

Of course, when writing a letter, we should be respectful, for example, "Dear Mr. Cockroach.” Another important point: the reason there are cockroaches and ants is primarily because they are attracted to odors. If we keep things clean and tidy, removing what attracts them, and frequently say to them, "This is my home; please be kind and leave. The outside is your home, and there is plenty of food outside," with sincerity and by removing the root cause of what attracts them, the numbers will slowly diminish.

Throughout history, many highly cultivated individuals also had magnetic fields. In the early Republic of China, there was a great sage known to society, Master Yinguang (印光大師). His virtue was so profound that Master Hongyi greatly admired him and wanted to become his student. However, Master Yinguang was humble and declined. When Master Yinguang moved into a room, there were many ants. The staff wanted to sweep them away, but he said, "No, no. (Also fearing he might inadvertently harm them.) It is due to my own lack of virtue. Do not disturb them." Shortly thereafter, all the ants moved away. Thus, there is a connection. If we still see ants and cockroaches at home, it's a reminder that our virtue is lacking. If we take Master Yinguang as our example, diligently correct ourselves, suddenly they may disappear. Then we can think, “My virtue has improved a little bit.”

Let us continue with the next sentence from the sutra:

**“Being perverse and self-righteous, one will certainly have many regrets and errors.”**

"Perverse" (乖僻) refers to a temperament that is extremely eccentric, odd, unbalanced, and sometimes stubborn with a bad temper. "Self-righteous" (自是) means being self-opinionated. Someone with an eccentric and self-righteous personality who is also obstinate and unyielding will certainly have “many regrets and errors" (悔誤必多). Because they are arrogant and do not listen to advice, they will make many mistakes and have much regret, and will be in a state of constant annoyance. The word for regret (後悔) indicates that regret comes only *after*.

A self-righteous person is not well-liked. Zeng Guofan (曾國藩) said, "Being disliked stems from arrogance." An arrogant person is surely disliked. The reason for being perverse and self-righteous is often that one is spoiled by one’s parents, and the bad attitudes are not corrected in time, leading to a bad character. As the saying goes, “If you don’t heed the advice of the elders, you will suffer before your eyes.”

Now, when we read "Being perverse and self-righteous, one will certainly have many regrets and errors," we may think this only applies to those with strange or bad personalities. But consider this: How many children in the next generation are not self-righteous? This is because we didn't properly educate their characters when they were young. Do children today listen to their parents? Sometimes, when they get stubborn, nobody can reason with them. Sometimes when we see two- or three-year-olds throw tantrums, their mouths pout up high!

Several years ago, I heard of a report about a mother who took her child to a fair. The child saw something he wanted. When his mother told him they already had one at home, he insisted on getting it. When his mother refused, this young boy, an elementary school student, grabbed his mother’s hair in front of a crowd of people. The photos were even published in newspapers. An auntie standing nearby couldn’t bear to watch. She said to the boy, “Don’t pull your mother’s hair. Here, I’ll give you money to buy it!” The boy continued to pull and yelled back, “Mind your own business!”

When a child's personality is so stubborn, they cannot be reasoned with. How will they manage their lives in the future? If we truly care for children, we must not spoil them. "To love them without guidance is to harm them.” The ancients were very compassionate, and even their choice of words and idioms were meant to inspire us. For example, "溺愛" (nìài, excessive love), is a very well-chosen term. 溺 (nì) means “to drown someone.” So, what drowns them? Their own desires. Excessive love drowns them.

There is a famous historical example from the Warring States period: Zhao Kuo (趙括), who was only knowledgeable “on paper” but lacked real ability. He was also obstinate and self-righteous, thinking he was very capable. His mother understood his personality. Thus, when the monarch wanted to appoint him to command the army, his mother tried to advise the monarch, saying, “I am ashamed to say that I didn’t teach my son well when he was young. He’s all talk and has no true ability. He is also arrogant.” But the monarch was unwise and didn’t listen to her advice. Remember, "No one knows their child better than the mother." His mother knew his character best. Later, Zhao Kuo was appointed as commander and led the troops. As a result, four hundred thousand soldiers from the Zhao kingdom were defeated and massacred by the Qin army. This all happened because he was incompetent, did not heed the advice of those around him, and acted according to his own will.

Thus, “Being perverse and self-righteous, one will certainly have many regrets and errors,” not only harms oneself but can also harm those around you. This is especially true of leaders and teachers; if their thoughts and values are wrong, they will mislead their students. Reflecting on this concept on a national level, consider: every family in China has its own difficult issues. Why? Because we have neglected the teachings of our ancestors. For example, the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* (《朱子治家格言》), did we ever teach them to our children?

One hundred years ago, these maxims were universally known and studied, a common part of family education in our nation's history. However, in my generation, I only read them after I had grown up. Because we have stopped listening to the teachings of our ancestors, filial piety and brotherly respect are no longer practiced in families. Thrift and diligence are no longer practiced. As a result, children today are lazy and extravagant. Is this not an example of “being perverse and self-righteous, one will certainly have many regrets and errors”? Children need strict discipline. But what have we become? We give them everything they want. We have become indulgent. Thus, as the *Zuo Zhuan* (《左傳》) tells us, “When people abandon the proper way, monsters appear." “The proper way” refers to the constant path of being human. The Five Relationships, Five Constants, Four Cardinal Virtues, and Eight Virtues are the proper way for humans to be. For example, the Five Constants: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness.

We can understand the Five Constants through the stories we mentioned earlier. The first is "benevolence" (仁): we must protect all forms of life. Children should be taught to abstain from killing from a young age. “Righteousness” (義): we should not take ill-gotten gains, especially teaching children to abstain from greed. We shouldn't let them hoard things to eat themselves, not sharing with their parents or others. The character for "greed" (貪) is related to "poverty" (貧), the more greedy and stingy one is, the less fortune one will have. So, teaching children must revolve around the principles of benevolence and righteousness. Confucius and Mencius taught the importance of “discussing morality and speaking of benevolence and righteousness.” “Propriety” (禮): when the child pulled his mother's hair, was there any respect? These chaotic behaviors are a result of abandoning the proper path. “Wisdom” (智): if we don’t teach children using benevolence, righteousness, and propriety, it is not wise. What are we using to teach children instead? Being calculating and unwilling to give, which is contrary to the Five Constants.

Today's saying, "Being perverse and self-righteous, one will certainly have many regrets and errors," is extremely important. It deeply affects a child's life as well as our own. "Success in all things comes from respect, and failure from arrogance." Arrogance always leads to failure. When a person transforms to be humble, as the saying goes, "Complacency brings loss, and humility brings benefit.”  If we transform from "perverse and self-righteous" to “humble and respectful,” our fate will change. If we turn towards humility and respect, guiding children to stand on the wisdom of our five-thousand-year-old ancestors, not being self-opinionated when shaping their lives, their lives will surely be successful and even sage-like. Family fortunes will surely flourish. As the saying goes, “Literature and study are the foundation for family prosperity.” If the family wants to prosper, there is no other way than to delve into the teachings of the sages. With virtue and wisdom, the family will surely thrive.

Okay, I will share with you up to this point today. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional, natural-sounding English style:

**Lecture 17:  Packing Up and Throwing Away Wrong Ideas**

Respected elders and friends, hello! Last time, we discussed "Do not be greedy for delicacies and recklessly kill livestock."  We then emphasized, "Always watch for insects and ants as you walk," stressing that even small lives should not be harmed.  A friend asked what to do about the many cockroaches and ants in their home. If you don’t want to harm them, what methods should be used? Last time, we mentioned that you shouldn’t have smells in the home that attract them.  Keep your food tidy. For example, don’t immediately throw away small bags you use.  Put fruit peels, or anything sweet or odorous in those bags, seal them, and throw them away each time you go out.  Especially now, many bags can be sealed, which prevents odors from escaping, or you can tie them up, which will stop small creatures from being attracted into the house. Of course, you can also sincerely communicate with them, and use virtue to move these small lives so that they will each be content in their own places and not disturb each other.

As it turned out, right after last week’s class ended, I received a fax from a friend on Tuesday with some wonderful ideas! It said that ants are afraid of sour smells, mosquitoes are afraid of spicy smells, and cockroaches are afraid of fragrant smells. You can look these methods up online and try them. I was very touched when I saw this fax. It reminded me that there are still so many kind people in the world. When we are in need, there are always people who take the initiative to assist us.

A friend was discussing the issue of cockroaches and vegetarianism with a sixty-year-old elder. The elder disagreed, saying, “If humans were all vegetarian, the entire food chain would be disrupted. There would be more and more animals, and they would eventually interfere with human life.”  First, let's look back 100 years.  Humans have lived on this planet for a very long time. How many times a year did people eat meat 100 years ago?  Much less than now, right?  Maybe three to five times a year would have been a lot.  Actually, eating less meat won't affect the food chain.

During World War II, Denmark experienced severe food shortages due to the British blockade.  Because raising livestock for meat requires a lot of grains, which consumes considerable resources, the Danish government decided that the whole country would go vegetarian. Looking at the data, Denmark's food chain wasn't affected at all.  What's even more surprising?  During that period of nationwide vegetarianism, the people’s health improved a lot. The mortality rate fell by 17 percent in the first year of vegetarianism!

If you are observant, you’ll notice that many Buddhist monks who live to be over 90 or 100 years old.  Have we ever seen any centenarians who eat a lot of meat and seafood? They are all usually people of simple and moderate desires, and moderation makes them vigorous.  Today, people are eating more and more meat, but chronic illnesses are appearing earlier. Some teenagers are even developing high blood pressure and diabetes. It is all caused by their diet. Sometimes, when considering these issues, we can consider them in light of humanity’s past, or even historical examples like Denmark.

In the past, we ate meat only a few times a year. Did animals disturb humans?  No. Now we eat so much meat that we are the ones disturbing the animals. Humanity is the most intelligent of all living things, and we should have Heaven’s virtue of cherishing life and caring for all things. Otherwise, how could we be one of the three powers, along with Heaven and Earth?  Yet today, people do not cherish all things. Instead, they have become the destroyers of all things. Today, we don’t know how many species are becoming extinct on this planet.  May I ask, which species is the main culprit behind so many extinctions?  If a species were to go extinct, all other species would hold a seven-day carnival.

Let’s think about it calmly.  We all know that cancer is terrible.  Cancer cells multiply rapidly, destroying the body.  If we think of Earth as a person, which species is the cancer of the Earth?  Humans!  Humans are expanding constantly, threatening the Earth’s environment and the lives of all living things. We are destroying all of nature. We indulge our desires by eating wild animals, driving many to extinction. For thousands of years, the entire food chain was very balanced, but human desires are insatiable.  In the end, we harm life, and in fact, illness enters through the mouth. We also end up harming our own bodies. Moreover, because our desires are too great, and animals cannot keep up with our needs, farmers think of many terrible ways to grow animals quickly using hormones and antibiotics. All these toxins eventually end up in our bodies.

So, some issues are not difficult to think about if we broaden our perspectives. Unless we are very stubborn about our opinions, and don’t accept other people’s views no matter how they try to communicate with us, we might not be able to reach any common ground.

Additionally, this elder also mentioned, "If we don't kill insects like cockroaches, there will be cockroaches everywhere. Even if we can sense that they won't come to our homes, they'll go to our neighbor's homes. Isn't that doing to others what we don't want done to ourselves?" This elder is very kind; even when talking about cockroaches, he thinks of “not doing to others what we don't want done to ourselves.”  Frankly, if you ask ten people about any issue today, you will get ten different perspectives. For example, if you are faced with a life-altering decision, and you ask five friends, you will get five different opinions. Whose opinion should you follow? You should follow the classics, follow truth. Of course, we all care about our own environment, and if we’re clean, we won’t attract these things in the first place. It's not that if cockroaches don’t come to your house, they will definitely go to your neighbor's house. It’s that every household should develop good habits.

Therefore, the key to restoring balance in the food chain is that we humans need to give up killing and cherish life. Naturally, these problems won’t arise. We humans are facing so many problems, and we can’t seem to find the fundamental solutions. We’re all just addressing the symptoms. And when we deal with the symptoms, we’re always thinking about our own interests, trying to avoid any disturbance or harm, so it all seems very complicated. Look at all the methods that humans use to kill other beings, like inventing pesticides to kill insects. Have we solved the problem? No. That is why the following quote from our last lecture is very important:

【乖僻自是。悔誤必多。】
[“*Guāi pì zì shì. Huǐ wù bì duō.”*]
“*Guāi pì*” means having a quirky personality or using methods that do not follow truth and the natural way, do not follow Heaven’s virtue of cherishing life.  Then, being self-righteous about it, many regrets will follow. For example, using pesticides, isn’t that self-righteous?  First, has the insect problem been resolved? No.  Actually, modern humans are mistaken. Ancient people understood that there was harmony between all living things.  We should live in harmony and not kill. Now, we are self-centered, and we think that if something is hindering us, we must kill it. But actually, the relationship is one of harmony, and we misunderstand it to be one of opposition. That is the biggest problem.

For example, today, if we plant vegetables and they get infested with bugs, what are the bugs telling us? They’re telling us that the soil is probably poor and needs to be improved.  Slowly, plants will grow healthily. The relationship is not one of opposition. Now, when we see insects, we treat them like our greatest enemies, and we invent pesticides to kill them. May I ask, which species ends up consuming the most pesticides? This is entirely in line with the laws of nature.  Pesticides are created by humans, so of course, humans will end up consuming the most.  “What you send out will come back to you.” Smart people are outsmarted by their own cleverness. Why are they outsmarted by their cleverness? It’s because of their selfishness. If humans could think about the cycle of nature and the needs of other living things, they wouldn’t have invented things that kill living beings.

This is why it is said that human calculations are not as good as those of Heaven.  Heaven's way always returns.  Humans only think about the present. The harm will always return to them in the end.  We want to kill insects, but the insects are self-reliant and will adjust their entire body. In the end, one type of pesticide won’t work.  We will need to combine two or three types for them to be effective. We want to use pesticides to exterminate them, but the insects only grow stronger, and we do not exterminate them.  On the contrary, the problem of human infertility is increasing. So, being self-righteous and self-centered has turned all of nature upside down. It seems that science is progressing today, but why is all of nature becoming more chaotic? Science’s spirit of seeking truth is admirable. But if humans are using technology with arrogance, selfishness, and self-interest, they won’t benefit in the end.  Because technology is being used for selfish interests, people rush for quick gains, and they don’t consider the long term. As a result, the body is destroyed, and the environment is harmed.

Let’s continue our discussion of the quote, “*Guāi pì zì shì, huǐ wù bì duō.”* We were talking about the elder who questioned the concept of "not killing cockroaches.” Of course, when discussing these issues with an elder, if they are not receptive, we can stop the discussion. Don’t argue with them. You don’t want them to say, "Fine, I won't study traditional culture anymore." That would be terrible.  If others are receptive, then that is a mature connection. If they are not, we should humbly step aside. Be polite and patient. There is no need to argue to the point of a life or death conflict.

Last time, we mentioned, “*Rén qì cháng zé yāo xīng.*” If people abandon the natural way of life that they should follow, many strange phenomena will arise. Why don’t people follow the natural way?  It is because pride comes first, along with self-righteousness, and they do not listen to the elderly, to their parents, or to the teachings of the sages.  Let's think calmly.  What other factors can make us arrogant and unwilling to listen to others?  For example, early success.  For example, people today are more highly educated. They feel that their education is higher than their parents' and higher than those of the past.  They feel that what they know is the latest and most updated knowledge, and that their parents and those who came before them are outdated. As soon as these thoughts arise, people become particularly arrogant.

Furthermore, I feel that some of the things we learn in textbooks contribute to a sense of arrogance. I remember reading when I was a child that "Our generation is the most civilized that humanity has ever seen,” as if people of the past were all more backward than we are. Actually, people of the past were more intelligent than we are. People in the past might have been illiterate, but they understood ethics and morals. Today, even people with doctoral degrees may not understand filial piety. And the knowledge that we accept today has often not been verified against the truth. It could be wrong. However, because we have absorbed so much new knowledge, we feel as if we know more than those who came before us.

Actually, knowledge doesn't necessarily solve problems. Look at divorce rates and problems with raising children today. People’s educational attainment is much higher now, and yet these problems are increasing. Why can’t people solve these problems, even after over a decade of education? So knowledge doesn’t necessarily solve problems. Wisdom is what can solve problems. If we do not understand this, our arrogant attitude cannot be overcome.

I once met a mother whose child had graduated with a master's degree. One time, she asked her child to do a small task, I think it was getting something out of the refrigerator. The child failed to complete it. The mother was frustrated and said, "I can’t believe you can’t even do something this simple with a master's degree! How can you be so clumsy?” Her son immediately became angry and retorted, "I have a master's degree. How can you call me clumsy?"  Do you understand what this statement means?  "I have a master's degree. How can you call me clumsy?" This means that his master's degree has given him a sense of arrogance. He can no longer be criticized by his own mother for not doing a small thing right. He could not reflect on his failure. His emotions immediately got the better of him.

Actually, if we calmly ask ourselves, do we have any worries? Yes.  Whether we are a parent, a teacher, or a leader, if we want to help our children or our subordinates solve their problems, whose worries do we need to solve first? We ourselves are so confused! How can we possibly help others?

During the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu said, “Teachers are those who impart the Way, teach skills, and resolve doubts.” Parents are the most important first teachers in a child's life (and they are also teachers). So if parents still have doubts, how can they guide their children towards a bright and awakened life? Wisdom is needed to dispel doubts. But where does wisdom come from? It comes from a pure heart. How does one purify one's heart? The weaker one's desires, the clearer one's mind becomes. “Desires obscure the mind; greed clouds the judgment.” If you observe closely, you will see that many of the great mistakes in our lives happen because we can’t control our desires. We become confused and muddled, and one wrong step can destroy us. It can even destroy our entire family. Isn’t it our strong desires that block our wisdom?

People of the past had much weaker desires. People today have very strong desires. Yesterday I met a young person who rushed over to me and asked, "Teacher Cai, I want to be successful, and I want to achieve something. Can I use any means necessary to achieve this?”  Look at how quickly he spoke.  His mind was not settled, and one needs to be settled to have wisdom.  The first thing I said to this young man was that it is admirable that he was willing to seek advice. Many young people today walk around with their heads held so high that they’re in danger of running into things. It’s safer to look down. I asked him, "What is your definition of success?" We had to define it first. He said, "To be like the richest people.” I said that his success is measured by how wealthy he is, but true success is happiness. Wealth does not guarantee happiness. Many people think, “I must be successful,” but they need to ask themselves, “Success for what?”  They want success for happiness. But if we think about it calmly, do wealthy people have more worries, or do poor people? Generally speaking, wealthy people have more worries. I’ve heard that many wealthy people need sleeping pills to fall asleep. Once people are rich, and their desires are unleashed, they experience more suffering from not getting what they want. Why? Because they compare themselves with others. “Comparing oneself to others will drive you crazy.” So we shouldn’t think that making money is the only path to success and happiness. True happiness is actually an internal joy. For example, being filial to one's parents brings joy; helping others brings joy. The other party might not give us anything, but we feel fulfilled because it resonates with our inner nature.

Today, what does happiness consist of? External stimuli. Eating good food, wearing good clothes. But once you stimulate yourself in this way, you'll have more and more desires.  Has anyone ever said, "I’ve had a delicious meal. I'll never eat so well again"? Or, "I’ve finished this cigarette. I'll never smoke again." Or, "I’ve bought these beautiful clothes. I'll never buy anything like them again.”  Let me tell you, it really can be done, they just have to choose not to buy it or eat it now. Instead, they always say, "Just one more time!" It’s because they can’t suppress their desires at that moment. They can’t even make a promise for today, how can they guarantee what will happen in the future? Therefore, let me tell you, don’t listen to sweet talk carelessly. You must analyze things objectively. Unless you can slowly develop focus and come to realize that your desires are not what you’re truly seeking, but instead that you should focus on your wisdom and spiritual development. Frankly speaking, when a person's spirituality and mental state improve, their desires will decrease. Look at all those people who help others as their source of happiness. They volunteer for many hours each day and find their energy levels increase.  They derive joy from helping others, so of course they’ll feel very happy and fulfilled.

So when that young man asked me that question, the first thing I did was to clarify the definition of success. Then I asked him, "Do you want to be wealthy for one year, or ten years, or eight hundred years?" He said, "Well, eight hundred years is better.” Then I asked him, "Have you ever heard that wealth does not last…" It's not just three generations anymore. Now, it doesn’t even last one generation. Some businesses can’t even survive for three to five years. I once saw data from mainland China that showed that the average lifespan of small and medium-sized businesses is 2.9 years, less than three years! So many people start companies, but they fail in less than three years. They not only go bankrupt themselves, but they also lose all the money they borrowed from their relatives and friends. Why? Because they don't have virtue. Once they achieve some success, they might begin to be wasteful and arrogant, and they don’t listen to others.  Sooner or later, they will fall. Therefore, the foundation of a successful business is virtue. So many business owners have family problems. The rate is extremely high. As Laozi taught us, "Fortune and misfortune are intertwined.” Because people don't understand this, they look at everything very superficially.

Therefore, the fact that wealth doesn't last one generation or a few years is something we can all see happening around us. So, I told this young man, “Confucius lived over two thousand five hundred years ago. Which do you want to emulate?” Everyone would choose the one that lasts longer. If there’s a further opportunity, it would be beneficial to have him consider, “You can’t take anything with you.” You can’t take anything material with you when you die. So don’t spend your whole life pursuing material things, which you can’t take with you. If you have true wisdom, you should focus on leaving a family legacy that will last, as well as a model life, like Confucius, who has benefited the Chinese nation for over two thousand five hundred years. Also, you should focus on cultivating your soul and wisdom because you can take those things with you. You can take all of the good things you have done during your life. That brings up the issue of priorities in life. Otherwise, we’re just busy without purpose. In the end, when we take our last breath, we’ll have nothing to show for it.

Later, a second young person came over – I had quite a successful day yesterday. After going to the restroom, I was approached by three young people who asked me questions. Actually, I was quite happy about it.  The second young person came up and asked, "What are some of the attitudes we should have?" I couldn't give him a long explanation, so I gave him just one sentence so that he could remember it. “*Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*” teaches people that we should "cherish love and respect." We should learn to love others, and think of others. To “respect” means to respect others. If we hold these attitudes, they will be a very important foundation for our lives.  Look at his second reaction, "But many people don't cherish love and respect.”  Do you see that his second reaction is very telling?  He first thinks of others, and not about what he should be doing. We need to change this mindset. Why? Because, "Be strict with yourself, and lenient with others.” If we think about these principles, we always see other people’s faults first. We’re putting things in reverse. We’re being strict with others and lenient with ourselves.

Look at the “*Zhu Family Maxims.*” If we are just reciting, “Wake up early in the morning,” and looking to see who hasn’t done it; “Quirky and self-righteous” is used to point out who’s fault it is.  Then we're in trouble, the whole poem is used to criticize others.

When I used to read the “*Analects*,” what kinds of sentences were there the most of?  Sentences about the superior person and the inferior person: “The superior person is concerned with righteousness; the inferior person is concerned with gain;” “The superior person is harmonious but not conformist; the inferior person is conformist but not harmonious,” there are many of these kinds of sentences. Before, whenever I read the superior person, I would think, “I am a superior person.” Whenever I read the inferior person, I would think, “That person is inferior.” As I kept reading, I kept becoming more arrogant and self-righteous. Later, I realized that this was wrong. My teachers told me that every sentence is about oneself; you must view yourself as the subject. You need to change your perspective.  When you read about the inferior person, you must realize that you have these habits in your own heart. When you read about the superior person, you must see the virtues of others, “When you see a good person, think about how to be like them.” If you don’t have the right mindset, your virtue will deteriorate the more you read. When your mindset is correct, reading the classics and listening to lectures will uplift your mind.

Let's look at “*Guāi pì zì shì, huǐ wù bì duō*.”  Have we ever had regrets in our lives?  Yes. Have we ever made mistakes? Yes. So, this sentence is not about others; it's about ourselves.  When will we regret our mistakes? When my mother tells me something, but I don't listen; when my leader has advised me but I'm stubborn, that’s when I make a mistake and regret it. This sentence gives us a lot of opportunity for self-reflection.

So, the young man was very interesting. He immediately told me, "These people don't know how to live. They don't cherish love and respect." Then I told him, "There is no hateful person in the world. There are only pitiful people. If people act poorly, it must be because they haven’t had a good family education.  If you look at their past, they are pitiful. No one has taught them. You should be grateful that you can read the classics. You are more fortunate than they are."  Look at their past. People need to have eyes for the past and the future, or you'll get so angry when you see someone’s behavior and be at odds with them. “Looking ahead, they are pitiful people.  Looking into the future? They don't know how to live, so they are committing many bad deeds. In the future, they will reap much misfortune and may be lost forever. Looking to the future, they’re also pitiful, so don't take their actions personally. If you want to have a sense of responsibility, then you should try to move them, and that’s the best thing to do.” So, “If you are truly cultivating, you will not see the faults of the world.” When you see someone else’s faults, you will always encourage yourself that you are not doing well enough, that you must do better so that you can move them. This way, you won't be emotional, and instead you will motivate yourself. You should do your best to bring honor to the sages and the ancestors, and become a good disciple so that you can give others confidence.

***

I've tried to maintain a formal tone, while making the language sound natural and not overly literal. I have also kept the Chinese phrases in Pinyin where they are introduced, and then use a translation for the rest of the passage. Please let me know if you would like any adjustments or other translations.


Okay, here's the translation, aiming for a balance of accuracy, natural English flow, and a tone appropriate for a book on moral philosophy/self-improvement:

**Translation:**

Of course, after that kind of opposition had been removed, I further encouraged him, saying, “So, if you cultivate a heart of love and respect, you will have a wonderful life.” Why is that?  “Those who love others will be loved in return, and those who respect others will be respected in return.”  He listened, and his heart filled with hope for the future.

Later, I came out of the restroom and encountered a third young man. He said to me, “Teacher Cai, many years ago when you came to Ipoh, I was disrespectful to you. Please forgive me.” I was very moved.  Even after several years, he was still coming to apologize. What does this show us? “At birth, people are inherently good.” This young man appeared to be only about twenty years old. This act also tells us that everyone has a conscience.  Do we realize that?  His past impoliteness toward me weighed on his mind all these years, his conscience was uneasy, and he needed to apologize to feel relieved.  So, the sages and wise people understand human nature well, and it is true that people are all inherently good, possess a moral compass, and don't willingly choose to do evil, but are led astray by their environment. It’s just as we will learn next, “Close association with bad youths inevitably leads to suffering.” People are influenced by those around them and by their environment. That's why those who fall tend to do so because they lack good surroundings and opportunities.  Like Mencius' mother moving three times, it's to provide a better environment for her child.  Likewise, we should hope that the places where we live and the communities we’re in can be guided toward goodness by our own actions. We should actively do our part.

Confucius said in *The Analects*, “It is beautiful to dwell in a community of benevolence.” When people in a place all have hearts of kindness, that place is very dignified and beautiful.  I think that everyone who enters such a community will feel that the energy is different and that the people are especially kind.  After we hear this saying, “It is beautiful to dwell in a community of benevolence," we should quickly inquire about good places to live and move there. This is also one approach. But I advise everyone that seeking help from others is not as good as starting with ourselves. Begin with ourselves and help to bring about a better community.

In Hangzhou on the mainland of China, there is a saying, “Above there is paradise, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.” In Hangzhou, there was a woman named Wu Juping.  In her apartment complex, a child, due to some accident, was about to fall from the tenth floor window. When she saw what was happening, she immediately removed her high heels and ran to where the child was likely to fall. As she reached the spot, she heard the people around her start to scream, indicating that the child was falling. In that instant, she used her hands to catch the child. The child was saved, but her hand suffered a comminuted fracture. Moreover, she had just given birth a few months prior and was still breastfeeding. After being treated for her injuries, she was no longer able to breastfeed her own child. But she sacrificed herself to save the life of another child. Later, she wrote on the internet, “We refuse to stand idly by.” This sentence awakened the conscience of countless people, reigniting a sense of morality and the courage to do what is right.

In the citizen's square of Hangzhou, they have created a sculpture to honor her righteous deed. It depicts her hand catching the child. Wu Juping has given her whole heart to illuminate history and has already left an indelible mark on the hearts of the people of Hangzhou. Moreover, she is a national moral model.  All over China, and even overseas, after seeing videos of her noble example, people are learning from her. This kind of life has meaning, and her spirit will endure.

After her act of righteousness, people in her community have basically stopped arguing. For example, if a quarrel breaks out, someone might step in and say, "Wu Juping risked her life to save a child! What is there for you to argue about? Why are you still being so petty?"  So, a community can be gradually transformed by one person.  How does that start?  It starts from seeing a piece of litter and picking it up yourself, from greeting each other in the elevator, "Which floor are you going to?" Right?  That kind of human warmth and mutual care will gradually spread.  It even begins with respecting those who work for the community, such as those who clean up. When we see them contributing to the community, we can give them a bright smile and say, “Thank you, you’ve been working hard!” I think that will make their work that day much more pleasant. So, being very sincere when thanking others and showing gratitude is a daily act of kindness. A positive social atmosphere is gradually built from these small details.

From these discussions with young people, we can understand that many of them feel lost in life. They also hope to find a direction in life as quickly as possible, and to find standards of conduct, rather than just blindly following others. So, as parents, we should first delve into the classics, understand what is right and wrong, correct and incorrect, good and evil, and then we can guide our children in the right direction.

Let's return to the phrase, “Stubbornly self-willed, mistakes and regrets will surely follow.” As parents and elders, we should adopt this attitude: we should not allow our children to walk the same wrong paths and take the same detours that we have taken. First, let's talk about our own physical and mental health.  People's health is getting worse and worse these days. Why? Because they are not following the ancient ways of nurturing health, are too indulgent in their own desires, eating whatever they want whenever they want, or staying up late, indulging their desires. “Mistakes and regrets will surely follow.”

There are several fundamental principles of health that everyone must abide by, otherwise, they will regret it. The pains and illnesses we experience in middle and old age are the results of bad habits sown when we were young and strong. And now, we see people declining before they even reach old age.  Regarding physical health, the classics say, “Eating with moderation.” Don’t overeat, don't consume everything you see that you like. "Regulate your schedule."  Maintain a regular daily routine.  Don't stay up late or sleep in. And furthermore, "Do not overexert." This “exertion” means consuming too much energy. So, sometimes we should not work to the point of exhaustion, depleting our minds and bodies. It’s better to sleep early and rise early the next day. Staying up late is harmful to the body. But going to bed early and rising early isn’t. In particular, from 11 pm to 3 am, the gallbladder meridian and liver meridian need ample rest to function properly. So do not overwork. That also includes “extreme joy leads to sorrow.” Pleasure must be enjoyed in moderation. It cannot be excessive. We must be careful about these things.

Next, considering our overall life perspectives, this generation has strayed too far from the correct path. For example, for thousands of years, the purpose of life for Chinese people was service. If you have the chance to visit some ancient buildings, such as Xidi and Hongcun in southern Anhui, they still have many old houses where hundreds of people used to live. On the walls beside the doors of these houses, a fan is carved to remind everyone to perform good deeds when they go out, which is the purpose of life.  I also noticed that carvings of the four gentlemen – plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums – were on the doors and walls of these old buildings, reminding people to make good friends when they go out, and not to associate with bad friends.  “Close association with bad youths inevitably leads to suffering; relying on experienced elders provides aid in times of urgency.” This tells us that friends have an enormous influence on our ways of thinking. If one’s thinking is wrong, then one's life cannot be truly happy or fulfilling. And in which direction have we strayed now? Not speaking of others, but just myself, before I encountered the classics, I felt that life was all about making as much money as quickly as possible, so I could eat whatever I wanted, travel to Europe and America, drive a luxury car.  I used to own many neckties, and I was also caught up in this pursuit of desires.

I was talking with an education director the other day, and he said that one of the most serious mindsets today is materialism: that money is all-powerful and that we must possess it by any means.  And then hedonism. Everyone must understand that when you indulge in desires, when you seek wealth by any means, and prioritize profit over righteousness, then… divorce rates will keep rising, and there will be more and more conflicts between fathers and sons, and between siblings over money.  So these mindsets have misled people. Materialism and hedonism – these are, in fact, being controlled by greed. Nowadays, people think that these are the correct goals in life. If you try to tell them otherwise, they won't listen. They are "stubbornly self-willed, and mistakes and regrets will surely follow.”

I used to rush along that path myself, but later, after I read the classics, like the saying from Confucius, “The gentleman is concerned with righteousness; the small person is concerned with profit,” I also wanted to be a gentleman, not a small person. Having a sense of morality is the conduct of a gentleman; a small person just has a selfish and self-serving attitude toward life.  But I ask you, what are we teaching our children and students today? If we don't teach them filial piety, and don't teach them to love their siblings, how can they understand righteousness? We only tell them to get high grades, a high level of education, so that they can make lots of money in the future. Isn’t that using profit as the only motivation?

*The Book of Rites* says, concerning education, "The aim of education is to cultivate goodness and correct mistakes." To cultivate goodness in the heart, and to correct mistakes. But today, we don’t understand the most important spirit of education. The average parents feel that education is just about getting high scores; that’s success. But that's not the case. They have not grasped the core, which is to cultivate that heart of goodness, and in particular, to first cultivate filial piety, and then to correct mistakes. Bad habits and bad attitudes towards life must be changed.

If you look carefully, many college students are committing suicide before and after the summer break. And these people have consistently achieved good grades since childhood. Why do they choose to end their lives? Because their parents and teachers only saw their good grades, and didn't realize that their hearts were becoming increasingly unhealthy. Why is that? They get high scores, but they might be getting overly focused on winning or losing, and are unable to withstand failure. If they score lower than others, they can't accept it and try to end their lives.  Everyone thinks that the people who have problems are the ones with bad grades, but it is likely that the top students have more problems.  Therefore, whether the heart is kind and healthy is the essence of education. Why? Because this correct attitude will accompany a person throughout their life, and many people who get good grades are very jealous, because they cannot stand to see others doing well.

But if we, as parents and teachers, do not realize that education is "to cultivate goodness and correct mistakes," and we continue to follow what *we* think is right, that getting good grades is enough, then “mistakes and regrets will surely follow.” We will regret that we have failed to cultivate the pillars of our families and society.  So we should talk about life with service as its purpose; this would be correct. But now, it is hedonism, materialism, and another dangerous idea called extreme individualism. Everything is about putting oneself first. No one thinks about others. For thousands of years, when Chinese people were born into big families, they thought of their parents, their siblings, and the whole family. They didn't grow up selfish.  But now families have become small, and parents and grandparents don’t understand education, so they spoil their children. The children become little emperors and empresses.  Of course, they’ll develop extreme individualism. This is because the elders don’t understand education, and have caused these results. In fact, people of my father's generation didn’t think of themselves. Why did they study and work so hard? It was so that their parents could have a better life sooner, and they could serve their parents. The motivation for their lives was filial piety, a sense of responsibility. With this kind of intention, how could there be individualism? So now we must reflect on these phenomena in our families and in our schools, because we have deviated from the essence of education too much. In fact, *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* provide a standard.

So, of the three things we've been discussing: First we talked about nurturing health; second we discussed our life's values; and third, we discussed the fact that education must not deviate from the correct path. Too many things have deviated from the correct path. We are only giving a few examples for everyone to consider. Any chaotic situation is definitely a deviation from the correct path. By the standards of *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, studying is for the purpose of becoming a sage or a wise person.  But today, what is the purpose of studying? To get good grades, to get a good education, then to get a job and make money.

What does it mean to aim to be a sage or wise person? To continually increase one’s goodness and virtue. What is the purpose of grades, education, and making money? It is to increase one’s pursuit of fame and gain. So, now, there are many people who don’t take care of their parents. Why? Because they are only thinking of their own profit. Before their parents are even buried after they’ve passed, the children will fight over their assets. This is not accidental; it’s because of the bias in our education. We have to turn it back. Aim at becoming a sage.  First teach children to be filial at home, to be a good student at school, and to be a good and loyal worker or a good leader in the workplace.  A sage or a wise person fulfills all of the roles of life perfectly.

Fourth, since ancient times, there has been an unchanging principle for selecting talent. It is called “recommending those who are filial and incorruptible."  "Filial piety" is the foundation of virtuous conduct, and “incorruptibility” means not being greedy; it's an important aspect of a good attitude. If someone is not greedy, then they will work for the benefit of all, rather than for their own self-interest. This has been the standard for thousands of years.  But now? Talent is selected based on their education and skills.  So, now we have a lot of corruption. Many companies and organizations have hired people with advanced degrees and great skills, but they’ve ended up ruining those companies. We’ve seen for many years how so many Fortune 500 companies are ruined by those very high-level executives because they are too clever, making underhanded moves, and the companies eventually fall apart.

Therefore, "virtue and ability are both important," but which should be prioritized? Virtue. Nowadays, do the company owners and leaders consider this when hiring people?  Or do we still have to return to “recommending those who are filial and incorruptible?"  Confucius spoke very thoroughly about this.  We must take it seriously. Confucius said, “If a person has the talent and ability of the Duke of Zhou,” a person has the abilities and capabilities of the Duke of Zhou, but “is arrogant and stingy.” If they are arrogant, then they will eventually not listen to anyone. If they are stingy, meaning they're selfish and don't share good things with others, "then the rest is not worth considering." If their virtue is not solid, and they're arrogant, then you won't be able to lead them. Their arrogance will eventually lead the group down the wrong path, destroying it. The Duke of Zhou was the person whom Confucius most admired. By making that comparison, Confucius is saying that even someone with the greatest talent is not worth using if they are not humble and lack virtue. This should serve as a warning. So whether it is an organization, or even the people in the political world, when selecting party members, we should return to this standard of "filial and incorruptible" as well. These are some situations of deviation from the correct path that we must reflect upon.

“Stubbornly self-willed, mistakes and regrets will surely follow." If we look at it positively, it reminds us that "blessings lie in accepting criticism." If we change our attitude, and don't think we're always right, then we become able to accept the advice of others. Who are the most blessed? Those who listen to the advice of their parents, the advice of their teachers, the guidance of their leaders, and the wisdom of their ancestors. Those people are blessed. That’s why the *Standards for Students* says, “When praised, be concerned; when criticized, be glad. Draw near to righteous and reliable people.”

In history, the great Shun was very receptive to the advice of others, even actively asking people for their opinions. That’s why he became a sage-king. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, who created the flourishing era of Zhenguan, was also able to accept the advice of others. One time, after an advisor had given him advice, that advisor left, and the close officials around the emperor felt it was unfair to the emperor.  They said, “Your Majesty, what he said just now wasn’t true. Why didn’t you refute it?” Taizong said, “If I got emotional and refuted him on the spot, then he would never dare to advise me again.  And after he left, he would say that the emperor can’t accept the advice of others, and then no one else would dare to advise me.” So, even if his advisors spoke incorrectly, Taizong had the magnanimity to be tolerant and accept it, and that's how he created the Zhenguan era.

So, in the future, when others give us advice, even if they are wrong, we shouldn't immediately get emotional and try to explain or refute it.  First, we should listen to what they have to say. If what they say is correct, we should immediately change ourselves. If what they say is wrong, we should still be tolerant. And over time, we will see people's true hearts. The things they said wrong might become clear after two weeks or a month, and it will make the other person feel that “I criticized him for being wrong, and he was still tolerant of it. That person has great magnanimity.” That person will treasure you as a friend, and will even trust you more.  Then we will have even more opportunities to win the trust of others and exert influence.

Of course, accepting the advice of others shouldn't be a superficial act. After a friend gives me advice, and I bow deeply to him, “Thank you, you are the greatest benefactor of my life,” while I might seem to accept it, but don't change at all, that would be lip service.  The saying is “Accepting humbly, but absolutely refusing to change.” This becomes superficial lip service. If people try to advise us several times, and it becomes “a waste of my effort and energy, they are not really sincere about changing,” they will not offer advice any more.  And in fact, what is that? It’s trampling on the other person's sincere intentions. If we appear to be angry and don't accept the advice, they won’t be quite as sad. But, if someone has given you their advice out of good intentions and you finally reject it, it hurts them even more.

Confucius also taught us. Confucius said, “When someone gives you a sincere, well-intentioned warning, how can you not follow it?”  If someone gives sincere advice, which is in accord with the classics, to help us to achieve something and help us, then of course, we must follow it. But not superficially follow it. “Changing is the most valuable thing." If we are able to correct our mistakes, that’s the most valuable. If we superficially comply but never change, Confucius said that he would not be able to help that person. Even a sage would be unable to help. So, when we study each of the teachings of the classics, we must truly understand it and put it into practice, and do everything from our true heart. This is also the real way to value the teachings that our ancestors have passed down to us for five thousand years. Therefore, this understanding of cause and effect, and this valuing of connections, must be reflected in every moment. When others advise us, that’s a connection. We must treasure it and not waste it, and even repay this kindness. How do we repay it? When we change immediately, our family and friends will be the happiest. This is understanding connections, this is knowing kindness and repaying kindness, and this is a reflection of the responsibility of being a human being.

That is all I'll discuss on this sentence. Next week, we will discuss the next sentence, “When we willingly degenerate, it will be difficult for the family to prosper.” Okay, thank you, everyone!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy and natural flow, while maintaining a professional tone suitable for a book:

**Chapter 18: How to Build Self-Confidence**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! Our traditional colloquialisms, idioms, phrases, and even Chinese characters themselves are infused with the wisdom of life. For example, the saying we will be discussing today:

[頹隳自甘。家道難成。 (tuí huī zì gān. jiā dào nán chéng.)]

"To willingly degenerate, a family’s prosperity is hard to achieve."

When you read this passage, what idiom comes to mind? "To willingly wallow in depravity." When one does that, no one can help. Therefore, idioms can open up our wisdom. We cannot “abandon ourselves to despair,” we cannot “willingly wallow in depravity.”

It is not just idioms that can open our wisdom, but also colloquialisms and phrases. There is a saying, "Don't enjoy foolish blessings." Why are "blessing" and "foolishness" linked together? Because when people enjoy blessings, they start to think it’s their due, it’s only natural. They forget to be grateful, they forget the source of their good fortune. Isn’t someone who is ungrateful foolish? They don't even understand the basics of being human. In our time, material life is very abundant, but people are becoming more and more unreasonable and foolish. This is because blessings represent favorable circumstances. Those who can enjoy favorable circumstances, unless they have a very correct attitude towards life, such as an attitude of gratitude and diligence, will definitely degenerate as soon as they enjoy them. Therefore, those without wisdom cannot handle blessings. "Favorable circumstances eliminate people," we see that our generation and the next are enjoying blessings, but their quality is deteriorating drastically. Conversely, "Adverse circumstances temper people." When encountering trials and difficulties, a person's will and courage are strengthened.

Another saying goes, “Not knowing what’s good or bad.” In fact, we may not be able to distinguish what is truly good or bad. For example, adversity can actually elevate us and bring benefits. In the Minnan dialect, we say, “To take hardship as a tonic,” this is understanding what's good or bad. People in this world think that wealth and status are very good, but in fact, they do not know that things have many sides. Therefore, wealthier people are more likely to take sleeping pills. Have you ever heard of a farmer taking sleeping pills? No.

Another phrase that guides us is "family burden." What is a family burden? Having many houses, many stocks, a lot of possessions, and then constantly worrying about them: "Will their value depreciate? Where should I put them?" Thinking about this every day is exhausting. "And who is going to borrow money from me again? That second son, or the fourth daughter, is going to bother me again." Isn’t that a family burden?

So, "contentment brings happiness." "Having ten thousand pieces of family property, one still eats three meals a day." We only eat three meals a day. Have you ever heard of someone with a lot of money saying, "I want to eat six meals a day, what's it to you?" Okay, if they eat six meals, their stomach will definitely have problems in the end. Therefore, no matter how wealthy someone is, they cannot spend a huge amount of money. "Having a thousand rooms in a mansion, one sleeps on six feet of space." You might have many houses, but how many rooms do you sleep in at night? You only sleep in one bed. Has anyone said, "I have many houses, what's it to you? I'll sleep in the first room at eleven o'clock, and the second room at twelve o'clock, I just want to show the world that I have a lot of money!"? They will definitely suffer from neurasthenia.

If you think calmly, you'll realize that people really don’t need much material possessions in their lives. Educate your children to be content and thrifty, don't turn their lives into a pursuit of desires, or they will become slaves to their desires. Have you noticed that the direction of people’s efforts is wrong? Children who have not even started earning money are already very good at spending money, maxing out multiple credit cards. In fact, we create an obstacle in their lives when we allow them to develop such habits. Therefore, the fewer desires one has, the less encumbered they are. Then they will realize that the most important thing is the improvement of wisdom and spirituality. They will then experience the joy of growth and learning. They will also know that the purpose of life is to serve others, that helping others brings happiness, and doing good is the greatest joy.

People today do not understand this attitude. Not only do they not help others, but they also constantly bicker and antagonize others, which leads to a lot of suffering. Therefore, happiness or suffering is often determined by one’s attitude. The path they walk in life is vastly different.

Chinese “characters” (字, zì) also convey wisdom. We speak of the five constants: "benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness." The words spoken by a person are called “faithfulness.” If a person’s words are not reliable, then that person is no longer a person, right? They have no integrity. Therefore, "When we speak, faithfulness comes first."

Having discussed so many characters, words, and idioms, we are even more grateful to our ancestors for their kindness, who used so many methods to increase our wisdom, so that we can take fewer detours and avoid unnecessary paths. Just like we just discussed, "To willingly degenerate, a family’s prosperity is hard to achieve,” it makes us think of “willingly wallow in depravity,” “abandon oneself to despair,” and “digging one’s own grave.” If someone wants to fall into depravity, they are, as the saying goes, “an Adou who cannot be helped up.” Everyone has heard of this idiom, but who is Adou? “Liu Bei's son,” that's the standard answer in history class. However, when we study traditional culture, we’re not simply filling in standard answers. What is traditional culture? It's the study of our hearts and minds, it inspires our understanding and elevates our wisdom. “An Adou who cannot be helped up,” who is Adou? Those who are falling into depravity are Adou. Those who refuse to stand on their own feet and strive forward, those who give up on themselves, are Adou. And who might that be? It could be ourselves.

There’s a good saying, "Heaven abandons those who abandon themselves, and heaven saves those who save themselves, and heaven helps those who help themselves." This teaching tells us that the success or failure of a life depends on one’s own attitude. If one abandons themselves, they will keep sliding downward. If one can self-expect, seeking their own good fortune, then they will feel like they have many helpful people and beneficial circumstances helping them in life. So, in reality, we should realize that the cause of all our relationships in life is something we ourselves have brought about.

For example, if we have strong greed, we are more likely to be deceived by fraudsters. For instance, if someone ahead of us drops a package that looks like a bundle of money, and another person comes up and says to you, “Don't make a sound, let's go aside and split it.” Many people wouldn't be greedy in such a situation, and would simply walk away, and nothing would happen. However, if someone becomes greedy, they may actually go and try to divide the money, and then they will encounter an unfortunate incident. Therefore, if one has no greed, even if they encounter these bad circumstances, nothing bad will happen. Whatever circumstances we encounter in our lives, we need to look within ourselves.

There are many idioms containing the character "self" (自, zì) in them. Many are good, and many are bad. Therefore, whether good or bad is in our own hands. We just read some that are bad. Now let's read some good ones: “self-reliant and striving,” “self-motivated,” “seeking one's own good fortune.” Aren’t these also something that we create for ourselves? Good, so how do we transform our state of mind? How do we help ourselves, or how do we help friends, who have fallen into the situation of willingly wallowing in depravity?

In the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* course that we discussed previously, there was an important point: changing habits is the basis of establishing our destiny. Only by changing our bad habits and attitudes can we change our destiny. First, let's look at the state of willingly wallowing in depravity. It is often caused by an attitude of indulging desires. For example, Xia Jie and Shang Zhou were tyrants and the last emperors of their dynasties. Actually, when they were in power, they were surrounded by many virtuous people, but they did not use them, nor did they listen to their advice. Therefore, they indulged in their desires and were unable to accept the advice of others.

Many people, when facing misfortune or failure in their lives, say, “Heaven is too unfair, no one helps me.” This is called blaming heaven and others. This attitude is doubly sinful. Why? Because they blame heaven and others, they’re accusing God. They are also denying and blaming those who have helped or wanted to help them. Just how much good fortune is reduced by this one thought? There’s a saying, “One sentence can diminish half a lifetime's worth of blessings.” So is it possible for a single thought to diminish half a lifetime of blessings? Yes. It’s when we blame heaven and others, and when we are ungrateful. Those who are ungrateful are not qualified to be human. How can they be considered human if they are ungrateful to their parents, the country, and society who nurtured them?

Therefore, there’s a saying in *Geyan Lianbi* that “To be loyal and filial is to be a person, to govern a country and manage its affairs is to have learning, and to maintain stability amidst dangers is to have talent.” A person who does not know how to be loyal to the country, family, and others, and does not understand how to repay the kindness of their parents, cannot be considered a human being. We often say that even crows know how to feed their parents, and lambs know how to kneel to be fed. Even animals understand gratitude, so how can we humans not understand? How can we still be considered the masters of all things?

“To govern a country and manage its affairs is to have learning.” “Learning” is not academic qualifications, “learning” is real knowledge. What is real knowledge? Something that can cultivate one’s character, regulate their family, govern a country, and bring peace to the world, that is learning. In ancient times, an eighteen-year-old could become a county magistrate. They studied the learning to govern a country and bring peace to the world. What can an eighteen-year-old do now? Attend concerts? That’s a huge difference. They learn different things. In ancient education, Huang Xiang from the Eastern Han dynasty, at nine years old, would “warm the bed in the winter and cool it in the summer” for his parents. “Lu Ji carrying oranges,” at six years old, saw oranges and thought about bringing them home for his mother because she loved them the most. They were so filial at such a young age. From filial piety to loyalty, they thought about the entire nation and people.

“To maintain stability amidst dangers is to have talent.” When a family or organization experiences adversity, being able to use reason and wisdom to stabilize the situation and overcome this crisis, that is called talent, instead of just performing for everyone and expecting applause. So when we look at the ancients’ views, we feel that the talent and learning of today might just be empty displays, and yet we may have spent ten or twenty years of our lives learning them and yet could not learn real talent or real knowledge.

There’s a saying, “The morals of the world are deteriorating, and people’s hearts are not like they used to be.” People’s hearts are cultivated through education. Therefore, we still need to cherish the teachings of our ancestors, the wisdom, philosophy, methods, experience, and the results from five thousand years of education which have produced sages throughout the ages. Why are we facing such difficulties now? There are many problems in families and societies. It’s because we are not studying the teachings of our ancestors, we are learning about material gain and “when both above and below strive for profit, the state is in danger.” The nation is striving for profit, the families are striving for profit, sons are fighting their fathers over money, and brothers are suing each other in court. So cultivating a child’s desire for material gain from a young age will destroy their life.

But now the whole world emphasizes utilitarianism, and even kindergartens are starting to teach competition. The entire *Analects* does not teach one thing about competition. “The superior man does not contend.” It teaches to yield. When taught to be tolerant, they can control their temper. When taught to be humble, they will not be arrogant. When taught to be courteous, they will know how to respect others. A child who is respectful towards others everywhere will make good friends everywhere. A child who doesn’t know etiquette will make enemies everywhere. Therefore, tolerance, humility, and courtesy are very correct education.

As mentioned earlier, one's attitude may be very critical to the entire success or failure and the rise or decline of a person's life. People, every circumstance in their lives, are created by themselves. Therefore, a person who truly understands will take full responsibility for their own life, they will not complain or blame others, but instead they will know how to self-reflect. If a person knows how to self-reflect when encountering problems, they will gain experience. They can then turn crises into opportunities and turn grief into strength. However, if a person complains and blames others, then they may turn nothing into something, and small things into big problems.

Let’s look at this phrase "willingly degenerate.” People who complain and blame others easily degenerate willingly, willingly wallowing in depravity. People who indulge in desires easily degenerate willingly. This includes those who are lazy and those who have no sense of responsibility, who are prone to depravity. Because indulging in desires is like a bottomless abyss that one will certainly fall into. And for lazy people, "all kinds of bad habits come from laziness." If someone sleeps until ten or eleven in the morning every day, and does not look for work, and just plays on the computer, wasting their time, they will become what is called a "noble.” This kind of noble is called "moonlight goddess," as they spend all their money every month. There is also a type called "white-collar," who are lazy and irresponsible and live off their parents' retirement money. These are all situations of "willingly degenerating.”

These phenomena that we just discussed, if you really encounter such young people or children, are they easy to deal with? Therefore, every family in this era has their own set of difficult problems. In fact, many problems are difficult to handle because they are only taken seriously when they become severe. When they become "incurable" do we think they are serious. If we could have nipped them in the bud, such severe problems would never have occurred.

For example, if a person pays attention to their health, will they be more likely to get a serious illness? If someone pays attention to cultivating their child’s moral character, will their child’s behavior go off course in the end? For example, if parents really put their hearts into loving and accompanying their child as they grow up, then when that child lies for the first time, the parents will see that something is wrong in their eyes and they will educate them in a timely manner. For example, when a child steals money for the first time, will it be visible on their face? Children will inevitably have greedy thoughts, but for parents who are very attentive, when they see these signs, if they severely punish the child the first time they steal, they will not only not steal in the future, but they will also be very wary when seeing money. This is what it means to nip it in the bud. The whole of traditional education places great emphasis on prevention, rather than trying to adjust after a bad habit has already formed.

The passage in the *Book of Rites* called "Record on Learning," which should be studied by anyone who is a parent or teacher, it contains the most profound educational wisdom. One point mentioned is that, "To forbid something before it has arisen is called prevention.” Prevention. Our ancestors emphasized this educational concept thousands of years ago. Many educational theories in the West that they claim to have invented actually exist in Chinese classics. The Chinese do not boast about themselves because they believe these are the wisdom passed down from the sages of every generation. They’re not their own copyright, and they believe that these wisdoms exist in the innate goodness of each person.

"To forbid something before it has arisen is called prevention." This is “prevention.” "To forbid it after it has arisen is like wrestling with it and not being able to defeat it.” If a bad habit has already formed, and then you want to forbid it, even if you put in all your efforts, you may not be able to turn the situation around. For example, if a child has become addicted to computers, and you want to get them to quit, would it be like taking their life? It’s not only taking their life, but also the parents' lives. Many children run away in the middle of the night and cannot be found, making their parents very worried. If a child like that cannot be reformed, the parents will truly become skin and bone from worrying. This is called "forbidding after it has arisen.” You did not take preventative measures, nor did you establish the correct attitude towards life. Because “what is learned young becomes like one’s nature.” If you cultivate good habits from a young age, it will benefit them for their entire lives.

In my father's generation, there were very few cases of people willingly degenerating. However, after three or four decades, it seems that this phenomenon is more prominent in our generation. Therefore, we can understand from this that the entire Chinese culture relies on what for its transmission? The transmission by families. When a person is born, they think of their parents, they think of their family. They want to bring honor to their family and ancestors. This then raises their sense of responsibility. How can someone with a sense of responsibility be careless or lazy? They study hard and work diligently, all of which could be seen in the previous generation.

If we already made a mistake, and want to turn it around, we need to transform laziness into responsibility. If it is desire, we need to transform that into an ethical and moral life attitude. This can be transformed. For example, in my own life, I was chasing after fame and fortune, but when I truly understood that this kind of life was meaningless, that one should improve their morality and wisdom and then benefit others, and that life has value, I was able to make a change. Then we will no longer fall into depravity due to our desires.

Next, transform complaining and blaming others into self-reflection. Transform finding excuses into looking within ourselves. People are good at finding excuses and blaming others, as if they have good reasons for falling into depravity. We need to change our tendency to shrink back into having indomitable courage, becoming stronger when encountering setbacks.

And where do we start? We need to start with the parents. Because the most important aspect of education is leading by example. As it’s written in historical records, “those who teach by example are followed, and those who teach by words cause disputes.” If parents and elders lead by example, their virtue will move the inherent goodness of the children, and they will follow. “Those who teach by words,” only tell the children what to do but don’t do it themselves, and the children will be unconvinced. You are not filial to your grandparents, why do you ask us to be filial to you? It may lead to contention.

We previously mentioned that we need to seek our own good fortune. But in life, our spirit and time is often spent on self-denial. It seems that when we encounter problems, we easily become pessimistic, and lack confidence in ourselves. Do we have much confidence in ourselves? Actually, some people who have a lot of self-confidence might just be arrogant. Why? If you ask them why they are confident, they might say, "Because I have a graduate degree, therefore, I am very confident." Then what if they meet someone with a doctoral degree? What if they say, "Because my eyes are big and I have double eyelids." What if they meet a girl from Xinjiang whose eyes are even bigger? What if they say, "I have beautiful, dark hair, therefore I am very confident?" What about in ten years when they have grey hair? Will that confidence disappear? Is that right? So if this confidence is built on external conditions, then when they meet people who are better than them, will they lose their confidence? So, confidence should not be built on external and material comparisons. So, why is people’s confidence unreliable? Because the foundation on which it is built is wrong.

So where should confidence be built? It should be built on truth. Truth does not change. What is truth? “At the beginning of life, people are inherently good.” This is something everyone possesses. “The Way of the Great Learning lies in manifesting illustrious virtue,” “Illustrious virtue” (明德, míng dé) is wisdom, virtue, and blessings. It turns out I have innate wisdom, virtue, and blessings, just like the sages. So, those who have entered the realm of the sages, like Yan Hui and Mencius, said, “What was Shun? And what am I? Whoever exerts their efforts can become like them.” They were sages, they were those who came before us, and they stated firmly that as long as we put in the effort, we can definitely become sages.

The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* tells us, "Do not be reckless, do not give up on yourself, and you can be trained to become a sage or a wise man." Do you believe this? You believe it now, but will you believe it tomorrow? Tomorrow if someone criticizes us, we become like a deflated balloon, don't we? So our mood goes up and down, we don’t have any confidence. Today if someone praises us, we are very happy, but if someone criticizes us, we become incredibly sad. Therefore, it is not the outside people and things that are affecting us, but that we have not built true, unchanging confidence within ourselves.

Can you see that I used to lack confidence? I'm so slim, and I can’t compare to other people. Even when I was in junior high, I was less than 160 centimeters tall. Boys are afraid of being too short, so during that time, my mother was quite annoyed because I would often stand next to her and say, “Mom, what if I end up being as short as you?” My mother is 152 centimeters tall. So I would often nag my mom about this, which was my lack of filial piety, I should repent. I did not understand it back then. My grades and external conditions were not as good as others, so I was quite insecure.

So I would often ask others, "What do you think of me?" People would say, "Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?" You need to have courage to hear the truth. I even took personality tests. Some personality tests from foreign countries, if you get 40 points, they say your personality is like a tiger; if you get 50 points, they say your personality is like a koala, and also peacocks. After taking the test, we would go around telling people, "I’m like a koala.” You see, without confidence, we had to take personality tests, and the results said that we were like animals, and we would still be happy about it. Isn’t that pathetic? So for descendants of the Yellow Emperor to be living like this, is doing our ancestors a great disservice. Our ancestors are telling us, "You can be trained to become a sage or a wise man," and "What was Shun? And what am I? Whoever exerts their efforts can become like them." But we are lacking confidence to such a degree.

I am a person who lacked confidence, but one thing helped me greatly in my life: I believed that my ancestors would not lie, that the sages would not lie. People with good character would generally not lie, let alone sages. Therefore, I had no doubt about the words that they spoke. So when I opened the *Three Character Classic* and read, "At the beginning of life, people are inherently good," and when I opened the *Great Learning* and read, "The Way of the Great Learning lies in manifesting illustrious virtue," ah, I have it! From that day on, I was no longer insecure.

I hope this translation meets your requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further adjustments.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, keeping in mind the context of a speaker addressing an audience:

**Therefore, when built upon truth, there will be no lack of confidence, no inferiority.**

Having no inferiority is important, but we mustn't become arrogant. Why? "If not taught, nature will stray." I only began learning these principles as an adult, and I’ve already acquired some bad habits. I must quickly get rid of greed, anger, ignorance, and arrogance – these negative tendencies. Knowing that I still have these tendencies, how could I possibly be arrogant? When a single passage of scripture enters the heart, one's mindset becomes very healthy. “At birth, people are naturally good” – we no longer feel inferior. “If not taught, nature will stray” – we do not become arrogant.  Being neither inferior nor arrogant, we act with composure, trusting ourselves and trusting others.

Elders and friends, has your confidence been established? Will it remain constant from now on? Otherwise, we’ll continue to waste our lives with negative thinking and self-doubt. I feel that the most damaging thing in life is doubting oneself, and consequently, doubting others. Believe that you possess innate virtue, a fundamental goodness, and then, based on this truth, you will not only believe in yourself, but also trust in everyone’s potential for good.

Dear friends, in your life, have you ever encountered a person, a relative or friend, who has always had 100% trust in you? I believe you have. And don’t you feel that just thinking of that person gives you strength? Therefore, someone who believes that everyone has innate goodness and can become a sage or a virtuous person accumulates a lot of unseen merit just through their trusting gaze. We are all aiming to accumulate merit and virtue, aren’t we? Is there merit in consistently smiling and greeting people with a smile? Yes, it is. It’s called "a face without anger is an offering of service." A face without hostility, giving people a feeling of warmth, that is accumulating merit. There's also a saying, "From the mouth without anger comes forth wondrous fragrance" - speaking words that bring comfort and encouragement. So, if someone is skillful in speaking, they accumulate countless merits every day. If someone isn’t skillful, they lose a lot of blessings daily. We know that a face without anger is an offering, so before going out each day, take a look in the mirror. If you frighten yourself, don’t go out yet, or you'll diminish your blessings. I think that’s not quite enough; it shouldn’t just be before going out, but the moment we wake up we should look in the mirror. Otherwise we will frighten ourselves, and our family as well.

Constantly giving people a smile can accumulate merit, so, does consistently giving people confidence through your eyes also accumulate merit? When studying traditional culture, you need to infer from one instance to another; to connect related concepts - this is called "learning well". We’ve studied for over a decade and have a learning habit called ‘standard answers,’ and we just write down the standard answer.  For example, if I asked everyone, “What does ‘the incompetent Adou’ mean?" and you answered that Adou was Liu Bei’s son, what relevance does that have to our lives?  But if you think that Adou might be me, and if I give up on myself I might become like Adou, then I can’t let that happen! So, traditional culture isn’t about learning knowledge, or memorizing a lot of things that have no connection to your life. It emphasizes understanding and insightful comprehension; with one understanding, you can apply it in every situation. For example, when we learn to respect our parents, we realize that not only should we respect our own parents, but we should also "treat other fathers as we treat our own, and treat other brothers as we treat our own.” Even animals have their own ethical order. Animals have parents too. If we hurt an animal's parents, their children will be in the greatest pain.  "Be kind to your family, then be kind to your people, then love all living things." You will love all life, and you won't hurt anything.  This love and respect, expanding from people to all life, will constantly elevate your heart and character. Therefore, traditional culture is not about learning facts, or memorizing standard answers, but about constantly elevating your heart and mind and growing in wisdom and benevolence. *This* is the right way to learn. We just talked about establishing unwavering confidence in ourselves, a confidence based on truth. Only when we truly understand this will our children be able to build their confidence on truth.  If parents are very melancholic and negative, the next generation will be even worse – it’s a matter of “what is modeled above is followed below.” So, first, we must truly have confidence; and second, what else? We need a sense of responsibility and a sense of mission, and then our children will have a responsible and mission-driven attitude towards life.

First, who are we responsible to?  Ourselves. We must love ourselves before we can understand how to love others. How does responsibility to oneself manifest? It's not squandering one's life or one's time – that’s a responsible attitude. Moreover, our bodies are given to us by our parents. "Our bodies, hair, and skin are received from our parents, and we dare not damage them.” More importantly, we must use the body given to us by our parents to benefit the people and repay our parents' kindness – called "establishing oneself in virtue and acting righteously, bringing honor to one's parents, by leaving a good name in posterity." These are all expressions of responsibility.

If a person doesn’t constantly elevate their spirit, they are being irresponsible to themselves and end up degenerating. Because of being responsible to oneself, one then becomes responsible to the family. Consider the Qing Dynasty. Emperor Kangxi reigned for 61 years. He experienced many hardships throughout his life – many near-death situations. But he overcame them. Why? Because he was always thinking that he must not let down his ancestors, and he must not let down his grandmother, the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, who was so kind to him. So when a person thinks, "I want to bring prosperity to my family and clan," that’s their sense of responsibility.

Furthermore, we also have a responsibility to society. Life should be purposed by service. Actually, when we talk about "having a responsibility to society," if it sounds strange to you, "Why do I have a responsibility to society?" then you should be careful. If we don’t have that attitude, how will the next generation have it? So, now when college graduates are asked, "What do you want to do after graduating?" they say, "I want to quickly earn a million and then travel overseas." They *should* say, “I’m finally graduated; I have the ability to support my parents and give back to society.” *That’s* how you cultivate talent.

Therefore, we must take on responsibility for society. For example, I'm in the field of education now, so what is my responsibility? We used to say, "Teachers are the engineers of the human soul." This is my responsibility as a teacher. Seeing how quickly people’s hearts are degenerating now, how can I stand idly by? Isn’t this a sense of responsibility for my profession? What is my heavenly mission? What is my life’s purpose? It is to revitalize the way of the teacher. Every profession is constantly declining now because of the degeneration of morality. If our children or we ourselves are doctors, what is our responsibility? To revitalize the way of the doctor, upholding the spirit of compassion and mercy, not to just think about making money. Because if every profession does not revive its moral core, society as a whole will have no sense of security, right? We have this responsibility in whatever profession we are in.

I ask everyone, before buying food now, what do we do first? "Where was this produced?" “That place had a scandal with unsafe food.” Would we still dare to buy it? Exactly! The person selling unsafe food has tarnished the reputation of their entire profession. They have no sense of responsibility. So, the *Disciple’s Rule* says, “If one lacks virtue, it shames one’s family.” When a person is without virtue, whom do they insult? They insult themselves, they insult their family, they insult their profession, and they also insult their country and nation. Therefore, a person with a sense of responsibility will never "degenerate and give up," but they can certainly revitalize their family and their nation.

In Malaysia, there are many elders who have fulfilled their responsibility to their national culture. They did their best, and "exhausted their efforts until death." People like Mr. Lim Lian Geok and Mr. Shen Mu Yu had a sense of responsibility for their entire national culture. I once saw a piece of calligraphy that left a deep impression. "If rivers cease to flow" - it means not just rivers, but the entire natural environment will be so ruined that people can’t live in it. Extending to the meaning, “If rivers cease to flow, how can we face our descendants?" How are we going to face the generations to come?  Our descendants will say, "What kind of air did you leave us? What kind of soil? What kind of water source? What kind of sunshine?"

I know a government official who is very responsible. He wants to promote organic agriculture. In this era, if you truly want to contribute to the entire country, the nation, and society, you need to devote your entire life’s energy. Why? "It takes more than one cold day for three feet of ice to form." The current destruction of the environment and the human heart has taken place over more than a hundred years, due to the loss of traditional culture. Therefore, to reverse the situation, it can't be done in a short time. We need to have long-term vision and perseverance when doing good.  "Since ancient times, no one has escaped death; we can only leave behind a loyal heart shining through the ages.”

I'm talking with everyone to mentally prepare you. Maybe some will say, "It sounds very hard to do." I tell you, "If it’s hard to do, congratulations!" "Hard to do and you congratulate me?"  When something is hard to do, it proves whether we are sincere or not. The harder it is, the greater the merit. Therefore, there is no such thing as being taken advantage of. For example, in a family, an older brother or sister may give and sacrifice the most.  They may work to provide for their younger siblings, even if they had to stop their education in middle school to do it.  On the surface it looks like they're at a disadvantage, but such older siblings have immeasurable blessings in the future. Heaven is fair, there is no such thing as being at a disadvantage. That’s why our ancestors said, “Suffering is a blessing.” Look at how much suffering Mr. Shen Mu Yu endured. However, he contributed so much to the preservation of national culture, and his descendants are very prosperous. Confucius accomplished difficult deeds and accumulated great blessings which protected his descendants for over two and a half millennia. So I’m telling you, although it’s hard right now, congratulations everyone, you have an opportunity to perform great deeds, and extend blessings to countless generations. Do you want your family to remain prosperous for thousands of years? People need to have aspirations to gain motivation.  They need to have a sense of responsibility and set great goals.  The short decades we live go by quickly; we can't have come into this world in vain. We must make contributions.

The government official I know is very honest. He truly wants to promote traditional organic agriculture, otherwise humans won’t have any land to cultivate or food to eat.  The food we’re eating now is full of hormones, antibiotics, and pesticides. Cancer is not a random event; it’s inevitable. “Disease enters through the mouth.”

After he actually started doing it, he originally thought only the soil was polluted. After getting into it, he found that it wasn’t just the soil, but the water was also polluted, because of the irrigation process. The air was polluted too, because plants rely on photosynthesis to get nutrients and be healthy. Even the sunlight and overall temperature are a problem. So, if we really want to do good, because we’ve strayed so far from the right path, it will take three to four generations of unremitting effort to turn things around.

Elders and friends, do you feel that you're holding a baton in a relay race right now?  We pass the baton in a relay, one after another. I was just discussing the phrase “If rivers cease to flow”; the deep meaning behind it is what kind of environment and ideas do we want to leave to our next generation to be considered responsible parents? “If rivers cease to flow, how can we face our descendants?  If our culture is lost," if our five-thousand-year-old culture is lost in our generation, “how can we face our ancestors?” I would personally have no face to face my ancestors; I would have become an unfilial descendant. Therefore, we must have a sense of responsibility for our own national culture. We should emulate the spirit of Mr. Shen.

I'm very fortunate. This is also a blessing from my ancestors. I had the chance to meet Mr. Shen because I was promoting traditional culture. It made a profound and lifelong impact on us. The *Disciple's Rule* says, "Being close to the benevolent is endlessly good." It's true; meeting an elder with such wisdom and kindness is something one can never forget. His entire smile, his actions, they were so deeply moving. When we met Mr. Shen, he immediately played the organ himself and led us in singing an anti-Japanese patriotic song. That spirit of patriotism infected us. He urged us that teaching is the least lucrative profession, but the most important. Because the teacher has the responsibility to pass on cultural education. Culture is the soul of a nation. If people lack cultural cultivation, they become obsessed with fame and profit, turning into zombies. Therefore, this responsibility is very significant.

In this era, passing on culture may be even harder than it was in Confucius’s time, so the merit we accumulate is no less than that of Confucius. Let’s all make good vows and strive hard. Include your children; cultivate them to become the Confucius or Mencius of our time, and your family will certainly have its name written in history. So, I ask everyone, in today's world, how many Confucius's, how many Mencius's, how many Lao Tzu’s do we need to revive Chinese culture? Have you thought about that?  No matter how many, one of them is you yourself, and one of them is your own child. “Nothing is impossible for a willing heart.”

Confucius "knew his heavenly mandate at fifty." We must also quickly realize our heavenly mandate. In the 1970s, Professor Toynbee stated, "To solve the problems of the 21st century, the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and the Mahayana Buddhism are the only solution.” This world needs our Chinese culture to save it and bring it back to the right path towards happiness. After hearing this, do you feel your life is different? Some people are extraordinary; at seven or eight years old they were already thinking: What is the meaning of life? Why am I alive? What is the purpose of living? I, at seven or eight years old, was thinking: How can I eat an ice pop? How can I play?  So, those people are truly remarkable. Hearing Toynbee’s statement may have reminded them why they are in this world and they found their heavenly mission and purpose.

Let me repeat, to solve the problems of the 21st century, we need to rely on traditional Chinese culture. The teachings of Confucius and Mencius and the Mahayana Buddhism are the only treasures that can save the world and they are placed in the hands of Chinese people. This is our mission and responsibility to the world. Not only will we not degenerate, but we will truly contribute to the world and all under heaven in our lifetime.

Therefore, we have a treasure that can save the world. Congratulations everyone, in this life, you can save the world. This is extremely meaningful. Congratulations everyone, you have no path to retreat. Why? Because you can only go forward; going back is called “seeing death and not saving.” Seeing death and not saving is a transgression. So, "We cannot possibly satisfy everyone, but we only seek to have no shame in our hearts." As long as we have done what we should towards heaven and earth and all living things, then we can just strive forward. Because now we have found our direction, and we have found our confidence. We will definitely become sages and benefit all those we are connected with in our lives.

Today, I have shared the idea that “Degenerating and giving up will lead to family decline.” With this self-responsibility and self-expectation, we must then also seek a good environment to cultivate ourselves, right? Yes, because we are not yet sages. This is why Mencius’s mother moved three times, seeking a good environment. "When you are near vermillion, you become red, and when you are near ink, you become black." So elders and friends, after returning home today, first of all, “If a book is not righteous, avert your gaze.” Don’t read books that will give rise to wrong or unwholesome thoughts. Secondly, don’t watch bad television programs, OK? Third, do not befriend bad people. The *Classic of Zhu Zi* says, “Close association with evil people, in time will bring harm. Befriending the wise, in times of trouble, they can provide help.” *Disciple’s Rule* says, “Being close to the benevolent is endlessly good. Virtue increases daily, and faults decrease.” So, you should be close to good people and good environments.  "Not being close to the benevolent is endlessly harmful. Petty people advance, and all things will be ruined.”

Therefore, elders and friends, if you truly love your children, let them draw near the wisdom of our five-thousand-year-old ancestors. That is true loving-kindness. Alright, I rejoice with everyone. I will end my sharing here today. Thank you!


Okay, here's a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a tone appropriate for the content:

**Lecture 19: The Way of Making Friends**

Respected elders and friends, good day to you all! The ancients said, "If one does not read for three days, their countenance becomes unpleasant." This was the case for the ancients, who from childhood read the books of sages and virtuous people. However, if they did not read for a few days, not receiving this influence, their bad habits would slowly become uncontrollable. Therefore, they needed to be constantly immersed in these teachings every day. This was the practice of the ancients. May I ask, how long can *we* go without reading before our countenances become unpleasant? Because learning requires self-awareness. Knowing our own level allows us to know how to protect and nurture our path, our virtue, and our moral conduct. Only by nurturing ourselves well can we nurture the next generation and nurture others.

Why do I begin with this discussion? Because I feel it has been a while since we last met, perhaps two weeks. I see you all are glowing and radiant, which is evidence that you read the books of sages and virtuous people daily. This shows that you understand how to love and achieve yourselves. Because we all know that learning is like sailing against the current: if you do not advance, you will regress. So what did the ancient sages and virtuous ancestors teach us? They taught us a single word: "love." First and foremost, it is self-love. We must cherish ourselves to grow and achieve; only by growing ourselves can we benefit others. How can parents lacking wisdom benefit their children? How can leaders lacking wisdom lead their teams?

Therefore, if we have a sense of responsibility and a mission, our learning will be very proactive and will not be interrupted daily. As they say, "Perseverance is the root of success." You can observe that if we don't read the books of sages and virtuous people for two or three days, we feel more restless, as if we are about to lose our temper, as if we find everyone unpleasant. But if we read these books every day, we will feel that everyone is very cute and endearing. Why? Because reading the classics daily tells us that everyone has inherent goodness and can become a sage or virtuous person. This makes us feel comfortable with everyone.

In fact, it can be said that each line of the *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* is, first and foremost, focused on self-love. "Those who wish to love others must first love themselves; those who wish to save others must first save themselves." "The noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the path comes into being." Therefore, when we learn traditional culture, we shouldn't be in a rush to save others; who should we save first? We must first awaken ourselves to awaken others. How can it be possible that someone who is confused can help others achieve enlightenment? Like those of us who work in education, when we read Han Yu's saying, "A teacher is one who transmits the Dao, imparts knowledge, and resolves confusion," we should reflect. What Dao should we transmit? What knowledge should we impart? What confusions in life should we resolve? If we are engaged in education and we see this phrase, we should think: *I* still have so much confusion, how can I resolve the confusion of others? This will spur us to improve ourselves, teaching and learning together, spurring ourselves to grow. Will there come a day when a student comes to us and asks, "Teacher, what is the meaning of life?" We certainly can't tell them, "This question won't be on the test." Yet, this question is crucial to their direction and goals in life.

There was a graduate student from a prestigious university, exhausted from writing his dissertation, who came out of the library. He thought to himself, Confucius said, "To learn something and apply it at the proper time, is this not a pleasure?" How come I find studying so arduous? As he walked, he saw a resident walking their dog. The dog was swaying back and forth, appearing very happy. He watched this and thought: How come I am living worse than a dog? Why is a dog so happy, while people are living like this? So he went to his advisor and said, "Teacher, "To learn something and apply it at the proper time, is this not a pleasure?" How come my studies are so hard?” His advisor replied, "I'm the same as you." He was disheartened. Life becomes more and more difficult, so where is the meaning? He mustered his courage and went to the most famous teacher in his department and said, “Confucius would not lie; he said ‘To learn something and apply it at the proper time, is this not a pleasure?’ Why do I find my studies so difficult?” This teacher said emphatically, "Life is supposed to be like this." If life is supposed to be difficult, then what is the meaning of living? This question is worth pondering by humanity. Effort should make life more and more happy, isn't that right?

Recently, a colleague showed me a newspaper. It was right before graduation season and there had been several suicides among college students. It made me very sad. Their entire life's outlook had gone astray, and they were becoming more and more consumed with loss, lacking filial piety and kindness. If these children had studied the traditional culture of filial piety, they would not have walked this path. Therefore, when you open the newspaper, you will gradually have the feeling that now, introducing morality and ethics to others is even more urgent than putting out a fire. If a person's ideology goes astray and they lack good guidance, they might easily take a path of no return. So, if someone asks us for a scripture, "Could you give me a copy of the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child,* *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims*, or *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*?" What should we do? Give it to them immediately. If we don't have one on hand, we need to get it for them quickly, seriously. A friend of mine told me that one of his close friends asked him for a copy of the *Lectures on a Happy Life*. His friend's expression was very troubled when he asked for it. But that week, he was exceptionally busy, and he forgot about it. A few days later, he received a phone call that his good friend had committed suicide. Therefore, you need to understand that when people's thinking has gone astray, we must quickly nourish their souls with these sweet dew teachings; otherwise, something might happen. Therefore, seeing these news reports should make us feel that we have a responsibility to our relatives and friends, and to all those with whom we have a connection in this life. We must introduce them to the five thousand years of wisdom of our ancestors. With five thousand years of wisdom, they can see their lives more deeply and broadly and understand how to love themselves and love others.

From my own experience in education, when I read “Transmit the Dao, impart knowledge, and resolve confusion," I realized that I had to awaken myself first. Who is a child’s earliest teacher in their life? It is their parents. So do parents need to transmit the Dao? Do they need to impart knowledge? Do they need to convey to their children the attitudes towards life and work that can help them build their careers and achieve success? The sooner we teach these attitudes, the better, because "what is formed in youth becomes nature, and habits become second nature." Thus, during a child's growth, we should protect their good hearts and pure hearts. When their mental resolve and ability to distinguish right from wrong are strong enough, they will not be polluted or influenced. This will cultivate a pillar of society.

But how long does it take to nurture a child into a capable person? Two years? Five years? Our ancestors left us a saying: "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person." To cultivate a person of talent, it takes at least fifteen years. That is why educators emphasize running a "through train" school system, starting from age four or five, and continuing until age twenty - only fifteen years is roughly enough.

You all need to understand one thing: It is easier for a person to go from good to bad, but it is more difficult to change from bad to good. Let's not talk about others, let's talk about ourselves. For example, now that we are adults, is it easy for us to not lose our temper? "Just kill me, it’s too hard." For example, is it easy for us to put aside our ego immediately? It is not easy. Because these behaviors are ingrained. So, an analogy will help us understand how to love ourselves and how to love children. If a drop of ink falls into water, it is in there in less than a second. How much time will it take to remove that drop of ink from the water? Therefore, “it is easy to go from frugality to luxury,” it is very easy to go from frugality to luxury. However, “it is hard to go from luxury back to frugality.” Once someone has become accustomed to extravagance, it is difficult to ask them to stop.

Do you all know why there are so many scamming groups in the world today? Those scammers are not without hands and feet, why don’t they go and earn a living? It’s because they have become accustomed to spending and do not want to work hard. So, they scheme and think of all sorts of ways to quickly defraud people of their money. Therefore, the root cause of scamming groups is that society is too extravagant. Have you ever thought that scamming is connected to extravagance? Reading scriptures can open our eyes of wisdom. If today we only think about capturing all the scamming groups, without understanding how to start by teaching diligence and frugality, this problem cannot be resolved. The ancients were very clear about how societal trends developed over time. Therefore, only by reading the classics can we see deeply and broadly. Without reading the classics, being shortsighted, narrowly focused on immediate gains, and neglecting the fundamental issues is problematic.

Guan Zhong governed the state of Qi extremely well. He said, "When the state is extravagant, the expenditures are excessive; when the expenditures are excessive, the people become poor; when the people are poor, dishonest cunning arises; when dishonest cunning arises, wicked tricks are created." The entire process of development is crystal clear. If we haven't read *Guan Zi*, even a Ph.D. graduate can't pinpoint the problem. Because Ph.D. graduates are experts in a specific area of knowledge, yet it is the classics that can clearly delineate these principles of human behavior.

We studied *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* together. One section is called “Upholding the Correct Teachings." *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* should be reviewed often; it is such a great book.  The famous Japanese sinologist, Mr. Yasuoka Masahiro, was a teacher to four successive prime ministers, and he recommended that their emperor list this book as a national treasure for governance. *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* states, "The teachings are the eyes of all living beings for eternity..." Here, "teachings" refers to the classics, the "correct teachings." Without the classics, how can a person assist in the workings of the universe? How can they know that humanity is one of the three pillars along with heaven and earth, that humans can be as selfless as heaven and earth, and that humans can nourish and benefit all living things? If I had not read the *Three Character Classic*, I wouldn't understand. In the past, during my growth, I was also influenced by societal trends, believing that after graduating from university, one should do what? Rush out and earn money, eat well, dress well, and live well. I thought that was the goal of life. In reality, living this way turns you into a slave of your desires, making it increasingly difficult to find joy. Scientists say children laugh 180 times a day, while adults only laugh an average of seven times a day. Isn't that just living life with less and less joy? We can’t live life wrongly.

"Without the correct teachings, how can we assist in the workings of the universe? How can we shape all things? How can we escape the bonds of dust?" People have become slaves to their desires, and they are in constant suffering of unfulfilled desires, so it is difficult for them to find peace, joy and freedom. Whether life is happy or not, including the rise and fall of families, the wisdom to discern these things is in the classics. We must delve deeply into the scriptures to gain wisdom like an ocean; if we don’t deeply study the classics, we are guaranteed to have “a family with a scripture that is hard to recite.” Sometimes when I hear about a young person jumping off a building, I say to myself, how are their parents going to get through the rest of their lives?  Therefore, whenever you have an opportunity, you must quickly introduce traditional culture to those with whom you have a connection. It's possible that because of this, they won't commit suicide. Your good deeds will accumulate greatly, as they say, “saving one life is more meritorious than building a seven-story pagoda.”

Going back to our point, to save others, we must first save ourselves. May I ask you, are we improving or declining each day? If we continue to decline, we need to first cherish ourselves. It is difficult for people not to be influenced by their environment. As the saying goes, "Those who are close to vermilion become red, and those who are close to ink become black." We must first cut off the things that pollute us. This is called self-love. We must have concrete actions; otherwise, self-love just becomes a slogan. The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* tells us, "Do not go to noisy, chaotic places"; "Do not look at books that are not virtuous"; "If others are speaking of others’ strengths and others’ weaknesses, if it's not our concern, we should not meddle."

“Those who are close to vermilion become red, and those who are close to ink become black.” Let's calmly think: When we read the newspaper, are we gaining wisdom or being contaminated? Then, should we read it? Many newspaper sections today are filled with stories of killing, theft, sexual misconduct, and falsehoods, and it is horrifying to see. In reality, there are many good people, but all the reports focus on the bad ones, making people feel increasingly insecure.

Therefore, college journalism departments should first teach ethics and morals, and they should teach the most important principle of this profession: "Concealing the bad and promoting the good." In mainland China, the government organizes a moral exemplar selection program. Each time, dozens of moral exemplars are chosen, with more than one hundred million people participating, every two years. More than one hundred million people are all moved and in awe by the good deeds of these moral exemplars, and they then strive to emulate them. More than one hundred million people benefit; this is a good cause that the state is leading. The media has such a great influence, and when they take the lead, the effect is enormous. In mainland China, there's a program called "Touching China," which has been around for many years. Every year, when we hear that a new episode is released, we rush to watch it, and we are always very moved. Every protagonist nourishes our souls. If we have relatives or friends who work in television or print, we need to share this with them. If they understand, their programs and newspapers will daily inspire countless people's good hearts, and their merit will be immeasurable. If their television programs are full of killing, theft, sexual misconduct and falsehoods, their karmic retribution will be enormous. Some people use their blessings to create even greater blessings for society; others use their blessings to create immeasurable evil karma. As they say, “a small person becomes a small person because of ignorance.” They don't understand, otherwise, they wouldn't be willing to do so. When we understand, “A noble person is happy to be a noble person.” While others follow the crowd, we remain steadfast and act as noble persons.

Therefore, we need to first isolate the things that contaminate us. And when people reach adulthood, they are most easily influenced by their friends. Because in work and the workplace, the time we spend with our parents and relatives diminishes, and we spend the most time with colleagues and friends. Therefore, it is said, "Parents give birth to me, but friends help me to grow.  Being close to virtuous friends is like walking in a misty forest. Though one's clothes are not wet, they are always being moistened."  Being close to friends with virtue is like being in a forest where, at dawn, there is a mist.  Even though it feels as though your clothes aren’t wet, they are always being moistened by the mist. Therefore, friends influence us subtly.

If we observe calmly, some young people have better perspectives and insights than others. Why? Because they associate with friends who are older than them and they enjoy reading the teachings of the ancestors. No wonder their maturity is higher than others. These are not accidents. When we know how to observe, we can find the reasons behind each outcome. Then, we can emulate the good and we shouldn't repeat the bad.

Confucius once said something to his students which also helps us understand how friends influence us. Confucius said that after his death, Zi Xia’s moral and academic understanding will continue to grow, and Zi Gong’s moral and academic understanding will slowly decline. When listening to these stories, we need to understand them. May I ask you, in our current situation, are we more like Zi Xia or Zi Gong? Then, Zeng Zi, in his wisdom, understanding there must be a reason behind the teacher’s words, asked, “Master, why is that?” Confucius replied, “Zi Xia likes to associate with people whose virtue is higher than his own, while Zi Gong likes to interact with people who are not as good as him. That’s why, after I pass, they will develop in this way." Confucius also said that if you want to know a certain person, look at their father, and you can determine certain things. There's also a Fujian saying, “When choosing a field, choose one with good soil, and when choosing a wife, look at the manners of her mother’s family.” When a farmer is buying land, they must look at the soil to see if it is good. “When choosing a field, choose one with good soil.” When a person is marrying, they should first go to the family to investigate, to see if the girl’s mother has good virtue and is virtuous. If her mother is, there is a guarantee of quality from children raised in this family, and there are no issues. So, local sayings are often full of wisdom. Like those children who committed suicide, if an elder had shared some of these sayings, they may have broadened their perspective and been fine. Look at our Fujian saying: “One blade of grass, one drop of dew, heaven never closes all paths.” It’s true! “One blade of grass, one drop of dew, heaven never closes all paths.” When a person remembers this saying, they’ll ask why they are choosing such a difficult path. When their mind changes, they will be fine.

So Confucius says, if you want to know a child, look at his father; if you want to know a person, look at the friends he makes; if you want to know a leader, look at his subordinates. You can tell a lot from these observations. Then Confucius uses an analogy: “Living with good people is like entering a room full of fragrant orchids. After a while, one no longer smells the fragrance, because one has been transformed by it.” If you are in a room full of fragrant orchids, you will slowly be permeated with their fragrance. When does this influence occur? You won’t know. It happens naturally. “Living with bad people is like entering a fish market.” You go to the fish market and the fishy smell is very strong. After being there for a while, you will not smell it anymore. If someone else were to approach you, they would wrinkle their nose and say, “You smell!”
For example, people who don't smoke. I have tried this many times, my relatives and friends, when they walk into my house, even when they are three or four meters away, I say, "You smoke, right?" “How did you know?” they ask, they themselves can’t even tell.

So Confucius made a very important statement in this passage, “The noble person must be careful about who they associate with." The word "associate" means the friends one chooses to make. The ancients left us another saying: “The noble person avoids hasty associations. Choosing friends is like seeking a teacher." The noble person avoids associating carelessly with just anyone.  It is not proper to make friends haphazardly. Choosing friends to associate with should be as serious as seeking a teacher. Because the influence between friends is so rapid. What we will discuss today from the *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* is a key point in choosing friends:

**[Associating with wicked youths will eventually bring trouble; relying on virtuous elders will help in times of crisis.]**

Do you all feel this is also a key point in the rise and fall of a family? If the people you associate with are all moral people, the family will become prosperous. A country that "is close to virtuous ministers and distant from petty people" will become prosperous. For example, during the Spring and Autumn period, Duke Huan of Qi, by employing Guan Zhong, made the state of Qi flourish. When Liu Bei respectfully sought out Zhuge Kongming three times, the state of Shu was established. So, it is crucial to be close to virtuous people.

However, it is the same Duke Huan of Qi, who used Guan Zhong and became the most powerful ruler of the Spring and Autumn period. No ruler during that time contributed as much as Duke Huan of Qi. But after Guan Zhong died, Duke Huan of Qi no longer associated with virtuous people. Instead, he employed Yi Ya, Shu Diao, and Kai Fang. This is where the ability to discern becomes very important. Actually, before Guan Zhong passed away, Duke Huan of Qi had asked him who he should employ.  Duke Huan said, “Yi Ya is very good to me. He found out that I had never eaten the flesh of a baby, so Yi Ya killed his son and gave him to me to eat. Look how kind he is to me!”

Guan Zhong said, “If he doesn’t love his own child, will he love you? Going against human nature, he must have a very strong agenda towards you. You need to be careful.” “What about Kai Fang? He was originally a prince from a small country, but he has come to be close to me. He is very good to me. He didn’t even return home for his parents’ funerals. Look, he loves me more than his parents.” Duke Huan had become somewhat confused by this so-called love.  How many people understand how to discern? We shouldn't get dizzy when someone says "I love you". We must know how to discern. "Those who do not love their own parents but love others are said to be morally deviant." If a person does not love their parents, how is it possible that they will love you? They have already violated human nature.

Duke Huan then said, "What about Shu Diao? He castrated himself to be with me, and become a eunuch. He loves me more than his own body. Surely I can employ him?" Guan Zhong replied, "What people cherish the most is their own body. If he doesn’t even love his own body, he must have a much bigger goal he wants to achieve, which is why he is enduring so much pain." Duke Huan said, “Hmm, that makes sense,” and then ignored his advice.

But after Guan Zhong died, Duke Huan couldn’t resist his cravings for good food and for someone to play with, and he brought back these three people. As a result, “Associating with wicked youths will eventually bring trouble; relying on virtuous elders will help in times of crisis.”  Therefore, the wisdom of an enlightened elder will affect you for your entire life. After listening, we shouldn't forget their teachings.  Duke Huan forgot Guan Zhong’s words and was ultimately betrayed by these three evil ministers. He died a miserable death and wasn’t even buried.  His corpse was only discovered after sixty-seven days, when maggots crawled out of the palace. The greatest ruler of the Spring and Autumn period, ended up this way because he was close to petty people. If it was this way for a ruler, then how much more important is it for a family to be close to virtuous people and far away from petty ones.

The *Yin Zhi Wen* states, "Be close to good people, to cultivate virtue in your body and mind; stay away from evil people, to avoid disaster from your sight." Getting close to evil people, it’s possible that disaster is right in front of your eyes.  What I’m saying is not an exaggeration. For example, “Associating with wicked youths,” if our children associate with delinquent youths, over time, they will pick up bad habits and even invite disaster. These delinquent youths will likely have bad intentions, and they might steal or rob. If your child goes with them, disaster is right in front of their eyes.

In the eleventh year of the Kangxi reign, there was a man in Kunshan County called Ma Ji, who practiced martial arts and formed a gang that would go around drinking, stealing, and robbing. There was a rich man who had two sons. They were friends with Ma Ji.

That is the translation. I aimed to make it flow smoothly in English while preserving the original meaning and cultural context. Let me know if you have any other translation requests!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a natural English tone, suitable for a general audience. I've also tried to maintain the speaker's voice and emphasis.

**Translation:**

One day, this group of people went to rob a ship, and others tagged along. But as soon as the robbery began, the police arrived and arrested them all. Later, during the trial, the ringleader, Ma Ji, died in prison, and everyone else was sentenced to beheading, including the merchant’s two sons. Just like that, two lives were lost. “Proximity to evil inevitably leads to harm.” That’s why we need to learn how to choose our friends. Our children will naturally choose their friends, as behavior is modeled from the top down.

In “*Gems of Wisdom from Ancient Chinese Texts* 360, Book 1: Honoring Virtue – Making Friends,” the entire section focuses on making friends. I encourage everyone to study it when you have the opportunity. It includes a quote from the *Analects* of Confucius: “There are three kinds of beneficial friends, and three kinds of harmful friends. To befriend the upright, to befriend the sincere, and to befriend the well-informed—these are beneficial.” These types of friends greatly help us. The three kinds of harmful friends are: “To befriend those who are flattering, to befriend those who are ingratiating, and to befriend those who are glib-tongued—these are harmful.” These do great harm to our moral character. “To befriend the upright” refers to friends who are honest and selfless. Because they are upright, they will constantly remind and advise us. “To befriend the sincere”—“sincerity” means being tolerant and forgiving of others. “Sincerity” also implies genuineness. “To befriend the well-informed” means befriending those who are widely learned. When you talk to them, you’ll feel like, “A single conversation with you is worth ten years of study.”

Now, think about it. Do we have upright friends around us? Having upright friends is a *result*. What *attitude* must we have to achieve this result? “Fear praise, welcome criticism, and you will gradually become close to upright and sincere people.” We must have the attitude of accepting and appreciating others’ advice; then, upright friends will naturally come close to us. Moreover, upright friends don’t like flattery or sycophancy. Thus, as the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together."

Next, let's consider the three kinds of harmful friends. “To befriend those who are flattering” means befriending those who like to fawn and pander. “To befriend those who are ingratiating” refers to those who always speak sweetly and offer insincere praise, making others feel creeped out and disgusted. “To befriend those who are glib-tongued” refers to people who have excellent eloquence, capable of turning black into white, but their words have no basis in reason. If you lack discernment, you can be easily fooled by them. Befriending these three types of people will cause you harm. That’s why the *Standards for Students* says, “Do not be obsequious to the rich, nor arrogant to the poor; do not tire of the old, nor take pleasure in the new.” Are these four phrases easy to put into practice? People easily become obsequious to the rich and arrogant to the poor, and tire of the old while taking pleasure in the new. However, when we have upright friends by our side, they can immediately remind us, and we can turn back. But, if we associate with sycophants and flatterers, our bad habits will be easily triggered. So, befriending such people is indeed harmful.

Earlier, we talked about making good friends, about “birds of a feather flock together.” If *we* are someone worth befriending, then we will naturally attract good friends. “The superior person strives to establish the fundamentals; when the fundamentals are established, the Way is born.” Today, we understand that we need to make good friends. If we then try to befriend virtuous people, but we spend our time smoking, drinking, playing cards, and mahjong, our energy fields will be incompatible with them, and we will find it hard to become close to them. Therefore, to make good friends, we must first improve ourselves.

Taking this concept a step further, how should those who want to get married find a good partner? Improve yourself! Is that how people think these days? They’re all busy thinking, "I want someone who looks like Andy Lau, someone who is rich, someone who is this, that…” They set all sorts of conditions. When they actually find someone like that, the person might say, “I don’t want you.” So, if people don’t work on the fundamentals, they're just wasting their energy and effort.

The *Great Learning* tells us something very important: “Having virtue, one will have people; having people, one will have land; having land, one will have wealth; having wealth, one will be useful. Virtue is the root; wealth is the branch.” These days, if people haven't read the classics and gained wisdom, and are instead driven by a desire for quick success, their lives will truly be focusing on the branches while neglecting the root. The phrase "Having virtue, one will have people" means that, for those seeking marriage, if we have virtue, we will attract a partner with the same values. As the saying goes, “Dragons mate with dragons, phoenixes with phoenixes, and a rat's son knows how to dig.” When you share the same values, "having people leads to land." "When two people are of one mind, their strength can break through metal.” What is this “land”? A family, a business, or even leading a nation. For instance, King Wen of Zhou had great virtue and attracted Jiang Taigong. Didn't they end up establishing the Zhou Dynasty? With "land"—family and career—comes wealth. And with wealth, you can be useful. How do you use it? You use it to nurture children, train employees, and support the people, instead of just squandering it. Therefore, the more you use it in this way, the more your wisdom, virtue, and blessings will increase. Nowadays, people squander their money the moment they have it. In just a few years, they become discredited and lose their businesses. So, making money is about opportunity, but using money is about wisdom. Now, if we apply this to making friends, if we have virtue, we will naturally attract like-minded friends; if we lack virtue, we will attract nothing but fair-weather friends.

Looking at a person's role in their friendships, what duties should they fulfill to be considered virtuous? First, friends should mutually offer each other counsel. As the *Standards for Students* says, “If we mutually encourage good deeds, our virtue will be built; if we don't correct each other’s faults, the Way is lost.” Friendship is about moral obligation. We should mutually support each other in our spiritual growth and support each other's families. If we take our friends out to play mahjong until the wee hours of the morning, or to drink until late at night, their families and parents will be worried sick at home. How can we call that friendship? It's not only harmful to our friends but also harmful to their families, which is a great loss of virtue. It should be that when our friends associate with us, all their family members feel at ease. This is what we call accumulating *yin* virtue (hidden merit).

Counseling is a friend's duty. Of course, the mindset must be correct. Counseling is not about venting anger or using it as an excuse to criticize. It is about wanting the best for our friends, hoping they correct their faults, and wanting their virtue to increase. Therefore, “when relatives have faults,” and that includes friends, what is our goal? It is “to counsel them to improve,” so their virtue becomes better and better. And our attitude should be "with a pleasant expression and gentle tone." Only someone who is calm can give advice. As the ancients said, “With a calm heart and peaceful mind, one can speak.” When one is emotional, it’s better to remain silent. As soon as we are emotional, things tend to worsen. When it was originally nothing much, we can "bam," go out and immediately cause conflict and opposition. Therefore, when you're emotional, don't speak. If you have to speak, be calm and composed. Those being advised should be happy and grateful. Instead of being unhappy after being advised, they should bow and say, "Thank you. You are a noble person in my life." When the person hears that, they’ll know that the other person can really accept advice. And then, "upright and sincere people will gradually draw closer," which is also something you attract. In reality, "those involved are often confused while those on the sidelines are clear." We all need relatives and friends around us to give us appropriate reminders.

Secondly, we should care for our friends, and this care should extend to their families. When you see a good friend, show genuine concern: "How have you been lately?" "How are your parents doing?" "Is your sister's son healthy?" When your friend hears that, they will feel warm inside, knowing how much you care for them and their family. So, a truly virtuous person speaks in a way that makes others feel like they are basking in a spring breeze. But this is very difficult nowadays. We are all so busy every day, and our minds are very restless. When people in the workplace meet, whether superiors or subordinates, it’s all about, "Hurry, hurry, hurry! The thing I told you about last time, why are you so slow?" That's what it is like. There is no warmth or sense of humanity between people anymore. When working together in such a way, everyone feels great pressure, efficiency is low, and there's a lack of unity. If everyone cares for and cherishes each other, they would feel happy and invigorated, and working until 3 AM would be no problem. When everyone is united, everything is achievable. Therefore, this sense of caring is very important.

“The time of heaven is not as good as the advantage of the land, and the advantage of the land is not as good as the harmony of people.” Where does “harmony of people” come from? It comes from loving and respecting others. "Harbor love and respect in your heart." This is the most important sentence in “*Liao Fan's Four Lessons*." "Harbor love and respect in your heart" is the principle of all good deeds. All acts of kindness cannot be separated from a heart of love and reverence.

Third, we should know how to appreciate each other. What are we most afraid of in a group? Mutual jealousy and slander. These make it very difficult to maintain the bonds of friendship. Therefore, from the family level to the larger groups and society, what kind of atmosphere should we create? "When you see others do good, do not be jealous; be happy for them," which means appreciating others. These are the teachings of Teacher Li Bingnan. The right mindset makes a world of difference to a group. When everyone is jealous of those doing well, and are in that kind of environment every day, it's very painful. You constantly need to guard against others. However, if everyone is happy for others, appreciates and praises each other, then the whole group can be united, and everyone’s virtue will improve together.

"When you see someone do wrong, do not criticize; instead, give them advice, or remain silent." You see, we are back to the moral obligation among friends. If you have enough trust with the person, you can give advice. But, the attitude, location, and timing must be carefully chosen. For example, if others are present, that person is, after all, an adult, and will feel embarrassed if you call them out in public. So, “correcting faults should be done in private.” When you counsel a friend when no one else is around, what is the first thing they feel? They feel that you respect them greatly and have considered their feelings. That is very different. If you are supposedly trying to advise them, but actually just venting and complaining, "bam," and say it in front of a bunch of other people, how would that person face others later? They would feel that everyone looks down on them. Wouldn't that be unbearable? This is why it is important to give advice when there is sufficient trust. If there isn't yet sufficient trust, it's better to remain silent. What should you do? Work hard to improve yourself. When that person trusts you, you can advise them. If they don’t trust you, they might think you have something against them. So, this is how the human mind works, the way of people and how they feel. You might say, "But what if they don't trust me right now, and this is very serious and I have to advise them quickly?" What can you do? If the mountain doesn't turn, the road turns; if the road doesn't turn, the person turns. When learning, you need to be flexible. If they don't trust me, I can find someone they do trust, and speak to that person with sincerity, so that the other person understands that we genuinely care about them. They will say, "Okay, I will advise them." Isn't that still helping them? To be honest, "Nothing in the world is difficult for those who put their heart into it." If you truly have the intention to care for and help others, you will surely find a way.

"When you see someone do something wrong, do not blame them; instead, offer assistance." We should not get angry or lose our temper when things happen. A mistake has already been made. Is blame going to be helpful? Blame only allows us to vent, and doesn't help the other person. There is a saying: “Let bygones be bygones.” Once something has happened, we should quickly clean up the mess and help them. If things are already in a mess, and we’re still there scolding them, we will all be in even more pain. Isn’t that just adding insult to injury? Instead, we should actively offer assistance to help clean up the mess. Then the person who made the mistake will feel even more remorseful. They will think, "I messed things up for everyone, yet my friend hasn’t shown any resentment and is actually helping me so much." When you advise them after that, anything you say will be easily accepted. Because you still cared for them after they made a mistake, they will know you genuinely care. These are all the attitudes we should have when dealing with friends.

It is the same in the family. If a child drops and breaks a glass, and then, "Do you know I paid five hundred dollars for that?" you start scolding. The child becomes very frightened. Actually, he or she was just trying to pour you some water, because they were trying to be a good child following the *Standards for Students* and knew that one should be warm to their parents during the winter and cool them during the summer. Let me tell you, children have less self-control. When they are excited to do good, it is easy for them to mess it up. But, you cannot fail to see their precious intention to be good. Is it the child's good intentions that are more important, or the glass? We always have to put the situation into perspective and weigh things out. "Don’t blame them, but offer assistance." After breaking the glass, Mom should help the child sweep up the pieces. And if the child says: "Mom, I broke it, and you’re not even angry, you didn't even scold me?" the mother should respond, "Child, you had good intentions." I guarantee you, at that point, your child's tears will fall. After that, your words will be remembered for life. When people are moved, their heart opens up, and the words enter. "It's okay, child, you were doing it out of filial piety. Remember, 'hold empty vessels as if they are full,' 'walk with ease, and stand upright,' so that these things will not happen again." Therefore, this idea of letting bygones be bygones is a very important practice.

Among friends, "when they are in trouble, we should not abandon them." If your relatives or friends are in trouble, you should do your best to help them and not abandon them. This is what we mean by talking about friends. The fourth point is "the obligation to share resources." If they have financial difficulties, you help them financially; if they have capability difficulties, you share your skills and life experience. These are the duties and responsibilities among friends.

Let’s review. We should mutually counsel, care for one another, extend that care to their families, appreciate each other, and share our resources. And to add one more point, friends should trust each other. Sometimes we might share our inner struggles with our close friends. This is what we call "a confidant." At this time, a person must have a certain understanding: Because our friend trusts us and shares their family matters and innermost thoughts with us, we must never tell others. If others then mock or ridicule them, it will be very difficult for them to stand among others. Therefore, how we use our words is very important in friendships.

In this era, as we learn traditional culture, we must have the mindset that Confucius spoke of, "Correct yourself, and do not demand it of others; then there will be no resentment." In our five social relationships, such as the friendship relationship, we understand that friends should fulfill these duties. So, who should fulfill these duties first? *We should*. We should “correct ourselves.” But, we tend to have the habit of demanding things of others first, instead of demanding it of ourselves. For example, when parents start to learn about the *Standards for Students*, who should start learning? So, you can see that before we started learning, our mindsets were often skewed and we didn't even realize it. "Teach your children by first teaching yourself." How can it be that the children start learning first?

I once held a traditional culture exchange with senior managers at an enterprise in Hainan. One of the courses was on management. I said to them, "Today we are going to discuss the topic of management. When you think of the word 'management,' who do you think of managing first?" They said, "The employees, who else?" Confucius did not teach that. "When one's own conduct is correct, the people will follow without being commanded." We must always be examples, and only then can we manage others. We must first manage ourselves. If we cannot manage ourselves, how can we manage others? The people will not be convinced. If a manager tells his employees, "Don't be late!" everyone below them will say, "You're always the one who is late, yet you're telling us?" How can you lead others like that?

Therefore, even if others have not yet learned, we should still put it into practice ourselves. We cannot first demand others to do it; otherwise, it will be counterproductive. It will start a family revolution, and don’t drag me into it at that point! You might say, “My wife was okay before, but after she started learning, she's like a police officer, always telling me that this is wrong and that is wrong. She went to some talk by Cai, whatever, and has turned into this. What happened?" Then you’re betraying me and are not being good friends! Therefore, mindset is very important. We must "correct ourselves," not demand things of others, "then there will be no resentment." Others will not resent us. If you demand good behavior of yourself, your transformation will lead to their recognition and respect. Your transformation will naturally awaken their own sense of goodness and shame, and then there will not be any resentment or rejection.

Today, we mainly discussed how “associating with wicked people will inevitably bring harm.” Therefore, we cannot make bad friends, and we cannot go to negative environments. This applies to all beings with spirits, not just humans. In ancient India, there was a country called the Vaisali Kingdom. The Vaisali Kingdom had a white elephant that accompanied the army to battle and defeat enemies. When there was no war, the elephant would execute criminals by raising its foot and crushing them to death. One time, its residence was burned down and had to be rebuilt. The elephant was temporarily moved to live next to a Buddhist temple. Living next to the temple, it heard the monks chanting the sutras every day. After a while, one day, they happened to be chanting a line from the *Dhammapada* that said, "Good deeds lead to heaven, evil deeds lead to the abyss." It was as if the elephant had been struck by lightning. After being exposed to this teaching for a while, when they brought the elephant out to execute a criminal, it raised its foot, but could not put it down. Instead, it sniffed and licked the criminal with its trunk. It could not bring itself to do it. Its heart had turned to kindness.

In truth, spirits are sensitive. I used to live in a Buddhist temple, and every time we started chanting sutras, a dog would come and chant with us. It was truly very solemn. Seeing is believing. They have the ability to sense things. One day, it lost track of time, and as soon as we started chanting, "clang," when the wooden block was struck, it came running over, "aw aw aw," why? It was embarrassed because it was late. I witnessed this with my own eyes. It also had the ability to sense if the person was cultivated or not. When a person of cultivation arrived, it would immediately sense it, and clear the path for him, and keep him company all the way. When it was someone uncultivated, it would pretend it didn't see them. So, you see how animals are affected by their environment. How much more so is it for humans?

Okay, that's all for our lesson today. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text, keeping in mind clarity, accuracy, and natural English flow:

**Lecture 20: Facing Slander with Wisdom**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! Last time, we discussed the saying, “Consorting with wicked youths inevitably leads to trouble.” Today, we will move on to:

**“Humbly seek the guidance of elders; in times of crisis, you can rely on them.”**

When people lack a foundation in virtue and the ability to stay grounded, they are inevitably influenced by the people and things around them. Therefore, knowing how to advance and retreat, and how to protect one's pure and kind heart, is a form of self-love. Some might say, "But aren't those wicked youths pitiable? If no one helps them, who will go to hell if I don’t?” Does this make sense?

To help others, we must first improve ourselves. Otherwise, if we try to help others and end up sinking along with them, it's counterproductive. So, the first step is to protect ourselves and constantly improve. If we can’t bear to see others fall, we can offer them books and DVDs. If they have good roots, they will study and delve deeper on their own. Since we are easily influenced by them, we need to understand how to handle the situation. We've provided them with books and DVDs. "Heaven helps those who help themselves." We've created a positive connection, and that’s the right way to think about it. Helping others should be done with careful consideration of our own abilities and resources.

Now, let's continue with: "Humbly seek the guidance of elders; in times of crisis, you can rely on them." “Humbly seeking the guidance of elders” means that we can humbly and respectfully seek the guidance of wise and experienced people. There's an idiom, "old and steady." In significant matters, experienced people are very composed and have the wisdom to make sound judgments. This is because experienced people have rich life experience and are kind-hearted. “Experience” means having gone through many things. “Life experience” means having truly understood the wisdom of life from those experiences. If a person only has experience without comparing their thoughts and actions with classical teachings to assess their correctness, and only says, "My past experience was like this, so that's how I do it," they may have flawed ideologies and judgments. They might even, having gained experience, unknowingly engage in self-promotion, saying things like, "When I was struggling, you weren't even born yet!" Frankly, people with real life experience become more humble and cautious, rather than constantly criticizing and making snap judgments. That is not how someone with life experience should behave. Because they’ve seen more of the world, they are more worried about making subjective judgments or misunderstanding others. This is real life experience. If a person’s life experience is rich but their heart is unkind, they won’t be considered old and steady; they’ll be considered cunning and treacherous. Therefore, a kind heart is very important.

When facing such individuals, "in times of crisis, you can rely on them." When you are in dire straits, or facing a major life decision that will affect your entire life, you can seek their advice. You can even depend on them in times of urgent need because they are righteous and will help you.

"Humbly seeking" is very important because it allows for an attitude of humility and receptiveness. Otherwise, even if the wisest people are around us, we will have difficulty benefiting from their wisdom. Because “a little sincerity and respect yields a little benefit, while much sincerity and respect yields much benefit." And “elders” are not just people; when we open the *Analects* it is the wisdom of Confucius; when we open the Chinese classics, it is the wisdom of five thousand years. But how much we gain is determined by whom? It's determined by our own attitude of “humble seeking” and “sincerity and respect.”  Therefore, everyone's gains from studying the same classic are different. It has nothing to do with the classic itself; it's related to one's attitude.

In the learning process, we often encounter life's doubts. Whenever we put on the recordings of our teachers, maybe within fifteen or twenty minutes, the teachings of those elders often resolve our problems. But if we are not sincere during the process, or if we are filled with our own thoughts, then these good principles will not enter our hearts. So, attitude determines our gains. Attitude determines success or failure. It is not that we change our attitude after achieving success.

Zhang Liang assisted Liu Bang in establishing the Han Dynasty. Speaking of the Han Dynasty, the global Chinese community now greatly values the inheritance and promotion of traditional culture. There is a slogan, "Returning to the Han and Tang Dynasties." The Han Dynasty was the Liu family's rule, and the Tang Dynasty was the Li family's rule. Therefore, those with the surnames Liu and Li cannot escape the responsibility of promoting Chinese culture and inheriting their ancestors’ virtuous ways. Likewise, those of us with the surname Cai must promote traditional culture. Why? Once, in Taiwan, I participated in a traditional culture course with teacher Chen Rui Zhu. We performed the three kneelings and nine prostrations to Confucius. After the ceremony, Teacher Chen said to me, "It's destined that we will be doing this for the rest of our lives." I said, "Why do you say that?" She said, "Over two thousand years ago, Confucius was cut off from food in the states of Chen and Cai. Therefore, those with the surnames Chen and Cai must promote Chinese culture and make up for the mistakes our ancestors once made."

*Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says, “Reflect on the virtue of our ancestors; reflect on how to rectify our parent's mistakes.” We must atone for the wrongdoings of our parents and ancestors. “Reflect on how to repay the grace of our country; reflect on how to bring blessings to our families; reflect on how to help others in need; and reflect on how to restrain our own evil thoughts." Therefore, people must accept their roles in life. Those of us with the surname Cai must be engaged in promoting Chinese culture.

Of course, we must inherit the exemplary virtues of our ancestors. For example, the reason Liu Bang was able to gain control of the country was because he was assisted by three very capable individuals. He felt they were all responsible for his success and did not take the credit. This is a valuable trait for a leader: attributing success to others.

Similarly, with the Li surname, we should reflect on the reign of the Tang Dynasty. Those with the surname Li should learn from Lao Tzu's virtue and from the exemplary behavior of Li Shimin. What was Li Shimin's exemplary behavior? He accepted all advice, even if it was criticism. We are different now. We don't accept what is right, and we still act self-important. "Someone is still correcting me!" We cannot save face. So, first, you have to let go of saving face, otherwise it will hinder us from accepting the words of wisdom and advice. "Hear praise with fear, hear criticism with joy, and slowly become intimate with upright and honest people."

Speaking of the three heroes who founded the Han Dynasty, Zhang Liang was a nobleman from the state of Han. His grandfather and father were both Prime Ministers of Han, a very prestigious background. Later, when Qin Shi Huang destroyed the state of Han, Zhang Liang, seeking revenge for his country, spent his entire fortune to hire strong men to assassinate Qin Shi Huang. Of course, assassinating the emperor was an almost impossible task. He was young and impetuous. Can young and impetuous people achieve great things? It’s difficult, and they can often ruin things. So, in his life, he met an elder. This wise man observed that he was too rash and could not control his emotions or anger. He was not ready for greatness. Many wise people are very observant and can see the problems of these young people. One day, this elder was waiting on a bridge for Zhang Liang to come. When the elder saw Zhang Liang coming, he intentionally dropped his shoe off the bridge and then said to Zhang Liang, "Help me pick up my shoe.” Zhang Liang thought: he dropped it on purpose and is telling me to pick it up? He was getting angry but thought, well, he is so old, I shouldn’t hold it against him. So, he went down and picked it up. As a result, the elder then wiggled his foot and said, "Help me put it on." The most important thing that Zhang Liang lacked was the ability to endure hardship and humiliation. A person's achievements are proportional to their ability to endure hardship. Zhang Liang thought, well, I’ve already picked it up, so I’ll help him put it on. He helped him put it on. The elder was very satisfied and smiled, probably thinking, “This young man is teachable.” Young people who bicker with elders are too narrow-minded. In fact, if a person has good home training, they will respect the parents of others. Why? They have filial piety. When they see the parents of others, they know that being a parent is not easy. They would definitely be respectful to elders because this is what they are used to at home.

It is pitiful when young people in groups or companies are loud and disrespectful to their elders. It’s a sign of ill fortune. Why? No one has taught them. Respecting elders is a blessing. People’s blessings come in three forms: the first is respect, which is respecting elders; the second is gratitude, which is remembering the kindness of parents and all who have been kind to them; the third is compassion, which is pitying all people.

Of course, if young people nowadays do not respect elders, if we in the audience hear that, “Yes, the people in my company don’t know how to respect us!” Don’t hold it against them, have compassion for them instead. Why? Because they haven’t learned. They don't know the way, and they don’t understand righteousness. Although they are descendants of Yan and Huang, they haven’t learned the wisdom of their ancestors. It’s quite sad. How can we be like them? So, as elders, we must show virtue and magnanimity, and not hold it against them, and even help them. If we take our ancestors’ hearts as our own, there will be no reason why people in the Chinese community cannot get along harmoniously. That is compassion for young people, and it will lead to boundless future blessings. Frankly speaking, there is no such thing as loss in this world. Loss is a blessing. Those who know how to give are more blessed than those who receive.

In the end, after Zhang Liang helped the elder put on his shoe, the elder happily turned to leave. After walking a few steps, the elder suddenly turned around and said, "Tomorrow at dawn, wait for me here." He agreed. The next day, he arrived early, but the elder was already there. "Making the elder wait, come again tomorrow!" So, the third day, he arrived even earlier, and the elder was already there. "Come back next time!" The third time, he arrived in the middle of the night, and didn't go to sleep, just waiting for him there. Later, the elder taught him the military tactics of Jiang Tai Gong. The elder’s name was Huang Shi Gong, an elder of high virtue. Because Zhang Liang accepted Huang Shi Gong's teachings, he helped Liu Bang overthrow the Qin Dynasty and establish the Han Dynasty. Therefore, “humbly seeking the guidance of elders” requires humility, so one can truly receive great benefits.

Young people have nothing to lose. Why can't they be humble? Think about our ancestors. The Duke of Zhou was a sage, yet he was so humble. As we read in history, Duke Zhou was “stopping meals three times, and grasping hair three times to welcome guests". The Duke of Zhou would stop eating three times during a meal. Why? Because as soon as he heard that a person of virtue had arrived, he would humbly rush to seek advice, forgetting about the food. He was always thinking of the people. If he could bring in a person of virtue, the people would benefit. When washing his hair, because people in ancient times had long hair, it would take a long time. But if in the middle of washing his hair he heard that a virtuous person had come, he would immediately go to see them, not daring to be negligent. This is truly admirable. The *Book of Documents* tells us, “Fullness invites loss, humility invites benefit.” Humility is important, and respect is important. Including Liu Bei, he went to invite Zhuge Kongming, and it was his respectful attitude that convinced Kongming to come out of hiding. Therefore, history reveals to us that many of the important mentors in life are attracted by our own respectful and humble attitude. This is very important to one's life. Because as long as a person is not respectful and humble, they will surely fail. There is no exception.

If we look at the objective figures of the business community, these figures are many years old. I think that these figures are now even lower because people are now more eager to pursue fame and fortune. They cannot calm down and educate and improve themselves. This means they are likely worse at resisting temptation. The average lifespan of small and medium-sized businesses in Mainland China is 2.9 years; the average lifespan of large enterprises is 7-8 years. In just over ten years, they go out of business. Therefore, it is not easy to remain successful throughout one’s life.

Confucius once saw a vessel in the temple called a "tipping vessel." When this vessel is empty, it tilts; when it is filled with the right amount of water, it becomes upright; but when it is overfilled, it tips over. Confucius told his students that arrogance will eventually lead to failure and collapse. Once a person becomes arrogant, they will fail. Once a person thinks that they are very talented, their talent will cease to improve. Once a person thinks that their knowledge is high, their learning will stagnate. Therefore, Confucius sighed, "Arrogance leads to downfall." Xunzi also said, "The success of all things lies in respect; the failure of all things lies in arrogance.” Everything, whether it is a business or a career, can only succeed by doing things respectfully and by humbly accepting the advice of others. But why do they eventually fail? It is because of arrogance. Because they feel that they are invincible, they cannot listen to the advice of others. I have read many business magazines about why some of the largest global enterprises have ultimately failed. It is because the owners became arrogant due to their achievements, eventually ignoring the advice of their consultants and subordinates, which led to failure.

Confucius then told his students, “How can a person be full and yet not tip over?” The answer was, “be high and yet able to lower oneself; be full and yet able to be empty;" that is, possess great knowledge but be humble and not complacent; “be rich and yet able to be frugal;” be wealthy but live modestly; “be noble and yet able to be humble;” be of high status but treat others humbly.

I have an elder relative who is a police officer. His friends and classmates were assigned to the homes of high-ranking officials to protect them. As a result, he witnessed the spoiled behavior of the children of those officials. For example, when the security personnel opened the electric doors for the children when they left the house, the children would yell, "You're so slow!" These officials didn’t last long. Where could you see this coming? Like father, like son. And he realized that over half of the descendants of these high-ranking officials were arrogant. Therefore, it is not easy to remain humble and frugal while being wealthy. It takes wisdom to raise good children. Misfortune and fortune are intertwined. Having money does not mean it's a good thing. It is wise to conceal wealth and teach children well.

Then, he also saw that a few of the children of the high-ranking officials were very humble and respectful. Every time they left the house, they would say, "Thank you for your care and help! Thank you!" He noticed that these children of the high-ranking officials were all very successful. Therefore, "be noble and yet able to be humble" means to respect others, and not be overbearing and condescending.

"Be wise and yet able to appear foolish;" that is, to possess great wisdom yet appear simple and not be cunning or use your intelligence to suppress others. “Be courageous and yet able to be timid;” that is, although very courageous and decisive, not to be reckless but to know how to be cautious and careful. "Be eloquent and yet able to be reserved;” that is, although one has great eloquence, not to use it to suppress others, but to know when to remain silent. And only when it is necessary to explain many things clearly, should one use their eloquence. Usually, one should remain humble, and not show off their talents easily, otherwise, one will gradually become self-important and arrogant. “Be well-read and yet able to acknowledge one's limitations.” That is to have broad knowledge but to feel that your understanding is still superficial. In fact, all of this is about having a humble attitude. "Be clear-sighted and yet able to appear unclear;” that is, to see things clearly but not be harsh on others, to be able to play dumb sometimes. Sometimes, acting oblivious is needed to save someone’s face. This is how “humility invites benefit.” By maintaining humility, one can receive great benefits.

Once we have a good attitude, we then need to know how to discern the characteristics of an experienced and steady person. If people lack discernment now, they might admire those who say, "I'm good friends with some high-ranking official or some celebrity," and think they are amazing. In fact, a person who often goes around saying, "I know so and so," or "I'm good friends with so and so," is already showing off. This is not how a virtuous person behaves.

Rather, what is it? Experienced and steady people are humble. Moreover, they value harmony. People with life experience know that great issues can be reduced to minor ones, and minor issues can be resolved without further complication. They will not create trouble, which shows the wisdom of life. And they will always think about others and avoid making enemies. This is the attitude of valuing harmony. “Never speak ill of someone after ending the relationship." Even when people’s affinity for each other is over, they will not get angry or scold others. When people interact, they should always think long term, and not act on temporary impulses. Furthermore, experienced and steady people always think about the big picture when doing things.

During the Spring and Autumn period, under the rule of Duke Cheng of Jin, there was a minister named Zhao Dun, who was a great general. There was also a high-ranking official, the Grand Minister of Justice, Tu An Jia. Tu An Jia wanted to frame General Zhao Dun, so he manipulated the king into distrusting Zhao Dun. Because Duke Ling of Jin, the former ruler of Jin, had been incompetent, the ancestors of the Zhao family killed him. Tu An Jia used this as a pretext to accuse Zhao Dun, saying, "Their ancestors killed your ancestors, they will also threaten you." He spread all sorts of slanderous lies, killing this loyal minister and his entire family.

At that time, Zhao Dun's wife was pregnant. Because she was the sister of Duke Cheng of Jin, she was not killed. She gave birth to a boy, leaving this as the only surviving member of Zhao Dun's entire clan. Zhao Dun had a good friend named Cheng Ying, and a retainer named Gongsun Chujiu. They knew that Tu An Jia would surely kill this last descendant, so they agreed to repay Zhao Dun’s loyalty. How did they do it? Cheng Ying gave his own child to Gongsun Chujiu, and then let Gongsun Chujiu run off to the deep mountains. Cheng Ying then went to Tu An Jia and told him, "Zhao Dun's only son is hidden by Gongsun Chujiu in the deep mountains.” He was like a snitch, and he received one thousand taels of gold. Then, Tu An Jia led people to kill Gongsun Chujiu and the child. Actually, Cheng Ying had sacrificed his own child, for the sake of Zhao Dun's child, and he endured the humiliation and burden for over ten years.

When we hear about the conduct of the ancients, we are filled with awe and respect. They would sacrifice their lives for the loyalty they had with their friends, and to preserve their only heir. When Cheng Ying was planning this, he discussed it with Gongsun Chujiu. Gongsun Chujiu asked him, "Do you think it is easier to die for a friend right away or to live and endure humiliation for ten or twenty years?" Cheng Ying said, "Of course, it is easier to die right away.” In the past, people would give up their lives for the sake of righteousness. Then, Gongsun Chujiu said, "Then you do the hard part, and I will do the easy part first.” He took Cheng Ying’s child and ran up the mountain.

Cheng Ying saved the only orphan of the Zhao family. Mainland China even made this story into a drama. In fact, the whole of Mainland China is using dramas to portray the ancient loyalty, filial piety and righteousness, which have strong educational power. The examples of the ancients serve as lessons for the entire population to learn, including the selection of modern moral role models. If we feel that our hearts are very hard, I suggest we watch the moral role model selection program that Mainland China holds every two years. It is guaranteed that our hearts will soften because we will cry a lot. The examples are very moving.

Therefore, thinking of the big picture is a characteristic of experienced and steady people.

Also, experienced and steady people will get to the heart of the matter when guiding us. A gentleman focuses on the fundamentals. They will remind us to return to filial piety, to return to self-cultivation, and to return to our own hearts. They will tell us not to ask of others, and will remind us that we must correct ourselves to influence others. If we cannot move others, it is not their problem, it is our problem. They are always focused on the fundamentals. For example, Master Chang Ming (who is Uncle Lu, he’s been a monk for three years. I’ve known Uncle Lu for eleven years) taught us, “If you do a good job, you will naturally attract many people. If you do not do well, how can you attract anyone? If your own group is happy, then you have the chance to bring happiness to others. But if your group is unhappy, aren’t you going to be a laughingstock?” It’s always about focusing on the fundamentals. If we can meet an experienced and steady person in our life, we must cherish them. Cherishing is not just about saying it, but about cherishing their teachings and practicing them, and then we will have even greater blessings.

Let's continue with the next sentence:

**"Lightly heeding rumors, how can we know they are not slanders? We should patiently ponder before acting."**

From a literal perspective, this sentence means that when people hear others talking, their words may contain criticisms or slanders against others. If we fail to discern the truth in such words, we will be easily influenced and make rash decisions. At this time, we should "patiently ponder before acting," and calmly assess the situation. Otherwise, if we listen to slander, it can cause destructive situations in interpersonal relationships.

For example, there is a saying that goes, "Carefully avoid listening to slander, for listening to it will create a catastrophe.” The misfortunes of our lives can result from listening to slander. “If a ruler listens to slander, his loyal ministers will be killed.”; "If a father listens to slander, he will sever his relationship with his son."; "If a husband and wife listen to slander, they will divorce."; “If brothers listen to slander, they will separate.”; "If friends listen to slander, they will become distant."; “If family members listen to slander, they will become estranged.” There are many such examples in history. “A tall and capable man” must have the wisdom to discern “not to listen to the three-inch tongue. The tongue is like a sharp sword, killing people without a trace of blood.” Many families are broken because of slander.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and accurate rendition while maintaining the original tone:

**Translation:**

However, we must understand that slander is a condition, and negative consequences only arise when there is both a cause and a condition. What is the cause? The cause lies in our own lack of wisdom and excessive suspicion. This allows others to take advantage of our vulnerabilities. We cannot blame it on external circumstances; we must reflect on ourselves. Therefore, the ancients reminded us, "Rumors cease with the wise," and "Those who speak of right and wrong are themselves people of right and wrong." We must remain calm. When listening to others speak, we must judge whether they are objective, whether they have ill intentions, whether they have preconceived notions about the person they are discussing (leading to bias), whether they are driven by jealousy, or whether their arrogance is influencing their words. We must have the ability to discern.

This is especially true for leaders of organizations. What do groups fear most? They fear gossip and slander. Therefore, leaders have a responsibility to immediately investigate the source of any slander they hear and to admonish those who spread it. When we see evil, we must correct it, as we are responsible for the well-being of the entire group.

Our teacher once told us that when Director Han Ying heard slander, she immediately investigated, asking, "Where did this come from?" She then educated the person and told them not to do it again. The karma generated by those who spread slander and criticism is extremely heavy; their transgressions are severe. First, their own spirituality declines, and their arrogance and jealousy increase. This is detrimental to them. Second, by making criticisms and spreading slander, they fail to encourage those who have made an effort; instead, they criticize and ridicule, destroying people's enthusiasm. Is it easy to do good deeds these days? It’s not. Good people are often struck down, causing them to lose heart. This also affects morale. Because such words are spread, those who hear them develop prejudices against the person being discussed, harming relationships. This is all negative karma. It is possible that a single sentence can create tremendous sin. Therefore, we must not engage in slander and criticism. Group leaders must be particularly vigilant about such situations within their organizations. They must stop them and cultivate an environment where everyone can speak openly and honestly without resorting to private criticism. This creates an atmosphere of integrity and uprightness.

For example, Master Chang Ming guided us for three days, with a schedule of 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM each day (5 hours), potentially extending to 9:00 PM (6 hours). However, it often extended until 2:00 or 3:00 AM, indicating how completely he dedicated his energy to teaching and helping us. Over three days, it amounted to around thirty hours. These wise teachers forget themselves for the sake of the Dharma and work tirelessly for the Path. Finally, Master Chang Ming said, "Regarding our three-day meeting, each of you must point out one of my shortcomings." He personally demonstrated humility for us. If a leader is so accepting of honest feedback, how could criticism and backbiting flourish within the group? Master Chang Ming shared a very common, easily understandable, and insightful observation with our leaders: "If a lion leads a flock of sheep, the sheep become like lions; if sheep lead a flock of lions, the lions become like sheep." Therefore, a leader influences the atmosphere of the entire group.

The saying, "Do not lightly listen to words spoken; how do you know it is not someone's slander? One must exercise patience and think three times over," offers valuable insights for both ourselves and for leaders. Slander has a tremendous destructive power for families, organizations, and even countries.

When selecting important personnel, we must never choose those who are prone to slander. Regardless of their talent, if they are critical and prone to slander, they will inevitably create disharmony, causing people to lose mutual respect and reverence. "Heaven’s timing is not as advantageous as the land, and the land is not as advantageous as harmony among people." Therefore, a good character is more important than extraordinary talent. When a person is kind and never criticizes others, but is instead tolerant, he can gather talented individuals.

Consider the example of our teacher. When someone tries to engage in slander, if he has a close relationship with the person, he will stop them, saying, "Don't say it. I will only remember his good qualities, not his bad ones." Think about how the person spreading the criticism would feel upon hearing that. They would be moved by his high level of cultivation.

Imagine someone coming to you, saying, "I have to tell you, do you know what that person said about you?" How would we react? "What did they say? You have to tell me immediately!" We must ask ourselves, is it possible for us to listen to criticism without leaving any trace of it in our hearts? Do we have that level of self-control? Upon hearing criticism, we wouldn't be able to sleep that night. "I'll settle the score with him first thing tomorrow morning!" To speak calmly, one must have a peaceful heart. Otherwise, conflicts will only escalate. Since we cannot avoid being affected, it's best not to listen in the first place.

Therefore, our teacher would say, "Don't say it, I will only remember their good qualities." Or he might just say, “I understand, I understand,” and not listen. If the relationship is not so close, directly saying "I don't want to listen" might upset the other person. Thus, we must be skillful. "I understand, I already know," will likely stop them from speaking further. Or we can change the subject, saying, "That other thing is going well," and quickly redirect the conversation. Or, we can skillfully say, “That’s just a misunderstanding, they actually treat me very well, we just need to communicate,” and thus redirect the conversation.

The wisdom our teacher has imparted is extremely important. He said that whenever anyone tried to criticize his three teachers, he would immediately leave and not listen. Otherwise, he would lose respect for those teachers, a great loss that would prevent him from benefiting from these three great sages who were the wisest in Taiwan at that time. This is “lightly listening to words.” We must not listen lightly; we must calmly evaluate before acting.

Not only should we refrain from criticism and defamation, but we should also praise and appreciate others, thereby eliminating jealousy. Mr. Wang Fengyi, the “Northeast King,” taught us to “look for merits” – to focus on people's good qualities and commend their virtues. “Finding merits opens the path to Heaven, admitting faults closes the gates to Hell." Find the merits in others and admit your own shortcomings. By seeking the good in others, we can constantly affirm and be grateful to them. Where does this originate? We must start by seeking the merits of our parents. How foolish are people today? They even complain, criticize, and blame their parents. This is inappropriate. Even if parents have shortcomings—no one is perfect—they possess inherent goodness and virtue. We should be using every ounce of our energy to nurture their wisdom and strive to fulfill their well-being. How can we be criticizing them and finding fault with their actions?

Why should we support our parents? Because without them, there would be no us. Without them giving us birth and raising us, we would not exist. Our very lives could be sacrificed for our parents. What else can we not do for them? When we can calm down and reflect on the sacrifices our parents made throughout our upbringing, gratitude will naturally emerge. Our hearts will become more sensitive, and we will become aware of the need to repay their kindness, and readily express our gratitude to the kindness of others. Therefore, of all virtues, filial piety comes first. When the heart of filial piety is opened, other virtues will follow.

One of our fellow students, after engaging in "Remembering Ancestral Virtues" (reflecting on the virtues of parents, grandparents, and ancestors) and "Acknowledging One's Own Faults" (admitting our transgressions against parents, family, and others throughout our lives to reflect, repent, and then make amends), found that reflecting on his parents' kindness caused his tears to flow like a spring. Subsequently, he treated everyone with respect. Why? Because everyone is raised by parents, everyone is someone’s son or daughter. It’s not easy to raise children. Therefore, we should respect everyone and not create conflict or harm. When we see elders, we should be respectful because they are someone else’s parents and it's not easy to be a parent. As the Classic of Filial Piety says, "Those who love their parents, do not dare to hate others." Those who love their parents won't harbor hatred for or harm others. “Those who respect their parents, do not dare to be arrogant towards others.” A heart of respect is awakened in those who respect their parents, and they will not be arrogant toward anyone.

In a family or organization where everyone is grateful and repays kindness, and where everyone often "speaks of others' virtues, thereby doing good, knowing this, one will be even more motivated," the atmosphere of the home or organization will be excellent. The *Zhu Family Maxims* provide both positive examples to emulate and negative examples that serve as a warning. By transforming the negative examples into positive ones, we can benefit immensely.

The next line of scripture is:
[**When conflicts arise over matters, how do you know it is not your own fault? You must calmly reflect in your heart.**]

When conflicts arise between people over matters, it is very possible that we are also at fault. We need to calmly reflect and carefully consider. “Reflecting in your heart” means to calm down and think about the circumstances of the matter. Is there something we did wrong? Conflicts between people escalate when we believe the other person is completely at fault and we are without blame. If there’s been a fight, how can we be completely without blame? As the saying goes, "It takes two to tango." Or as the idiom states, "They are birds of a feather," meaning, “they are of the same level.” If a fight arises, it means that both sides are similar; what’s there to argue about? Some might argue that it is possible that one person is completely without blame while the other is completely at fault and also aggressive. Does this happen? Yes. And the person completely without blame who is criticized, isn’t that a pity? Let me tell you, the person completely without blame, yet criticized, ultimately becomes a sage; how can that be a pity? They don’t lose out at all.

Emperor Shun (the Great Shun), despite his parents being at fault, even wanting to kill him, still felt he himself was at fault. He was completely without fault yet he still reflected on his own behavior. Did he suffer a loss? No, his virtue was cultivated, blessings appeared, and he became emperor. Therefore, in learning traditional culture, we must first learn to accept losses and not argue with others. We must be tolerant, magnanimous, and avoid conflict. My teacher does not argue with others. When someone berates him, he doesn't respond. If the other person is angry enough to hit him, he will not retaliate. He will simply lie down and let them hit him, until they can't keep going. Why? Because when both parties become heated, they get more and more riled up. But if one side remains calm, the other side eventually feels embarrassed and stops, even apologizing the next day. Moreover, our teacher stated that his performance reviews were always the best, as he did not argue or create conflicts, and his superiors felt that he knew how to cooperate. How is that a loss?

Our parents’ generation understood this concept very well. Many parents today do not understand. If their child suffers a minor loss at school, they will rush to berate others. Some of our fellow students remember how their grandparents and parents taught them. If their child fought with a neighbor, and the neighbor came to the house to complain, they would be beaten immediately. Why were they punished first without the circumstances being examined? If a conflict had arisen, it was already wrong; they would be punished for it. They had to learn forbearance. If they are in the wrong, they must be able to forbear, and how much more if they have already been in conflict with someone. What reason is there to speak of fairness? They were beaten. It seems harsh, but it was full of wisdom. Why? Parents know the limits of their punishment. If one cannot bear with minor issues and creates conflicts, how will one survive in the real world? Therefore, the ancients were taught forbearance, humility, and courtesy to avoid many conflicts in life. I remember an elder who was very wise. If his child had a conflict with someone, he would always punish his child. He said, "If I do the beating, I know the limits, but in the outside world, they might be beaten to death." He thought far ahead.

After all this, are you willing to accept this? Of course, I am relaying the wisdom of the ancients and even of those who are only a generation removed from us. This should be absorbed and reflected upon, but when you go back home, don't say, "Teacher Tsai said I need to beat my child." I did not say that. Each child should be taught according to their individual needs. However, children need to learn to avoid conflict and to be able to forbear. If there is a conflict, it shows that one's self-cultivation is inadequate and that one deserves to be punished.

"A moment of forbearance leads to calm seas and tranquil waves, a step back opens up vast horizons.” If we apply this to ourselves, we can ask: Have you and your spouse argued this month? Who was right and who was wrong? If you have argued at all, you are both at fault. We must start by reflecting on ourselves. Our hearts are interconnected, so if one party reflects on their own actions, the other will be moved and reflect as well. If each takes responsibility, peace will prevail. But if each blames the other, focusing on right and wrong, things will devolve into chaos and destruction, becoming more and more serious. Therefore, whether a home experiences good fortune or disaster is within the realm of our thoughts; we must consider this carefully. We must “calmly reflect in our heart.” That’s what I wanted to share with you all today. Thank you!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Lecture 21: Signs of Prosperity: Don't Blame Others, Reflect on Yourself First**

Esteemed elders and friends, hello everyone! In our last lesson, we learned:

[“When listening to speech, how can you know it is not slanderous?  One should be patient and consider things thoroughly. When arguing over a matter, how can you know it is not your own fault? One must calmly reflect within.”]

Looking at “be patient and consider things thoroughly” and “calmly reflect within,” it’s clear that to unite a family in harmony and for people to get along harmoniously, these two phrases remind us that we must be calm and rational.  We need to know how to be tolerant and not be emotional, erupting with anger and rage at the slightest thing. Therefore, those who can control their emotions can control their future, and they can control the future of their family and their group. Especially as parents or leaders, if you are irrational, often act impulsively, have a bad temper, and are emotional, you may unconsciously influence your children to develop the same character. How did parents and elders of the past show their kindness and love? By setting a good example in front of their children, giving them a good influence. Why? Because when children are young, "what they learn young will be like their nature, and habits become second nature." So, good examples will subtly and gradually cultivate the right attitude of how to be a person and handle matters, which will benefit them throughout their lives. Kindness and love are expressed by thinking about a child's lifelong happiness, and this careful, rational attitude can be upheld.

Let’s further appreciate these two lines of scripture: When listening to others, you must be very calm and objective in your judgment. Don’t let your emotions flare up as soon as someone tells you how someone else is speaking ill of you, spreading rumors. The person may not have good intentions; they may be trying to slander you and hold prejudice. At this time, you need to be relatively calm and objectively analyze and judge the situation.

In reality, after a story has been passed through one or two people, it may be very different from the original situation. Why? Because the person speaking has one meaning, and the listener may have added their own meaning. So, a leader who understands that words are sometimes inaccurate and can cause misunderstandings will teach their subordinates to speak truthfully, without omitting or changing parts of the message, and to express themselves clearly. In these cases, they can say, “Please repeat back to me what I said.” Whether giving instructions face-to-face or over the phone, after giving instructions, they should say, “Please repeat back to me what I said.” This can confirm whether they remembered the instructions clearly and can express themselves clearly. All of this requires practice. Therefore, parents and leaders who understand how to train others in conversation and work will cultivate children and subordinates with stronger maturity and responsiveness. If these details are not valued, problems may arise one after another in doing things. In our Minnan dialect, we say things are done haphazardly, that things are not done carefully and meticulously, with problems appearing here and there.

So, after an objective analysis, if it’s slander, you shouldn’t listen to it. You might even skillfully remind the person spreading slander, or the person who criticizes, but not by blaming them. We should form positive connections with everyone and avoid negative ones. If you remind them with the intention of helping them, they are more likely to accept it.

If the words being spread are indeed slander, insults, or criticism, should we get angry?  “If it’s true, then correct it; if it’s not, then take it as encouragement.” If the criticism is correct, we should thank them. If someone tells you, “So-and-so is criticizing you,” and you say “Thank you,” the person delivering the message will be moved and think, “This person has high cultivation; I heard they’ve studied the *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* or the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, or *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*.” This is like giving a good reputation to the classics and our wise ancestors.

The *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says, “People who have not committed wrongdoings but are wrongly accused of evil will often experience a sudden rise in their families' fortunes." I ask everyone, if the person themselves has cultivation and can endure humiliation, and their children experience sudden prosperity, then what about the person themselves? Won’t their blessings be even greater? "When one understands the principle, the heart will be at peace." A person who truly understands the principle will not let their heart fluctuate with changing circumstances. If people slander us, they are sending us and our descendants blessings. Is that good or not? So in the future, when people scold you, say thank you and bow to them; they are sending you blessings, and then they will stop scolding. It’s like a fight; if one person hits and the other doesn’t retaliate, eventually, the hitter will stop. Truly, everyone is a good person, and every event is a good event, as long as our mindset is right, no matter is bad. So we expect ourselves to form positive connections with everyone and avoid negative ones. If you really encounter someone who makes it hard to get along with you, then turn inward and seek the cause: “There is no one in this world who cannot be transformed; only that our sincerity is not yet sufficient.” If our sincerity is not yet sufficient, then don’t argue with them or be petty. Slowly this connection will change.

The second line, “When arguing over a matter, how can you know it is not your own fault? One must calmly reflect within.” Every day between family members, colleagues, and even strangers, things are bound to happen, and there may be misunderstandings, conflicts, or unpleasant situations. When we encounter these situations, we should reflect: first, that we may have wrongly blamed the other person.  Have you ever had the experience, for example, of someone asking for a book you borrowed from them: “Please give me back the book I lent you.” “I returned it to you; you forgot and wrongly blamed me.” You may very confidently say that you’ve already returned it, but then when you go home later that day and look in your bookcase, you find it there! Sometimes we are very sure about our own thoughts, but we might have wrongly blamed someone.  If you do discover that you wrongly blamed them, you need to quickly apologize.

Sometimes, even though we haven't wrongly blamed someone, we might get angry during a conversation, saying, “Can you speak with a better attitude?” But when we say that, is our own attitude good? So, it’s often easier to demand things from others and not so easy to examine ourselves. This teaching is very important: when we're about to have a conflict with someone, "How can we know it is not our own fault?"

So, the cultivation that we should have when working or interacting with others is: "Forgive others with the heart you use to forgive yourself and you will maintain all your relationships; blame yourself with the heart you use to blame others and you will have fewer mistakes." We are less likely to be in opposition with or criticize people if we are forgiving of others with the same heart that we use to forgive ourselves. And in that way, we can build close relationships. Reflect on this statement: how many times a day do we forgive and excuse ourselves? How many bad thoughts arise? How many wrong things have we said? Do we engage in self-reflection every day? We’ve made so many mistakes without criticizing ourselves, but if others make a small mistake, we cling to it relentlessly. This is not a generous heart or a generous way to treat others.  Therefore, we must forgive others with the heart that we use to forgive ourselves so that it is less likely we will oppose or have friction with them.

However, we should also blame ourselves with the heart we use to blame others. "Even the most foolish people are clear when blaming others." Usually, we may not be very smart, but when it comes to criticizing others and pointing out their shortcomings, suddenly we become very smart. When I used to manage classes, some children’s grades were not very good, but if there was a discussion about where a classmate went wrong, they would be the first and fastest to speak. Even the most mischievous children in the class who often made mistakes could do an excellent job of pointing out other people's faults; they were very good at it. “Though they have wisdom, they become confused when forgiving themselves." Forgiving themselves and not acknowledging their mistakes, they gradually deceive themselves. Even if they have wisdom, they slowly become foolish. Not admitting mistakes and even arguing will turn something into nothing, and small things into big things; how can that be wise?

Therefore, if we reflect on ourselves with the same heart we use to blame others, we can gradually cultivate our self-awareness and attitude towards changing our faults, and our mistakes will become fewer and fewer.  Actually, if we think calmly, when we criticize others, the shortcoming that we are pointing out, if we examine ourselves, we may also have. If we are criticizing a shortcoming that we ourselves have, can the other person accept that? Yes, we are forgiving of ourselves, yet being strict with others; how can people’s hearts be at peace? Thus, we must be "strict with ourselves and generous with others." We should not be doing the opposite, which is to be strict with others and generous with ourselves. To learn this way would be: upside down.

Really, in the process of getting along and working together, even if it is indeed the other person’s fault and we haven't done anything wrong, we don’t need to argue or be angry, right? Why? “Let bygones be bygones”; the situation has already happened, so what’s the use of scolding them? It won’t help the situation. It is only an inability to control your temper. Therefore, "when you see that someone has done something wrong,” they've already made a mistake, don't criticize, but help them. But it’s very interesting: If you criticize people when they make mistakes, they feel you are kicking them when they're down. If you don’t criticize them, but help them clean up the mess and handle the aftermath, they may feel embarrassed, and then they will think you are very generous. And then, they will be more open to accepting your advice.  If they have already made a mistake and are in a very messy and embarrassing situation, and we then scold them, they will definitely not accept it afterward. So, this is wisdom in dealing with the world. This is not something that I came up with; this was taught by Confucius. “Do not speak of what is accomplished." The deed has already been done, so don’t use it to make a bigger deal of things; "Do not advise about what is already done, and don’t dwell on the past." To keep dwelling on what has already passed is being impulsive, emotional, and will turn the family and organization into a place of unrest. Constantly dredging up old grievances is something that no one can tolerate. We should let bygones be bygones; that's true magnanimity.

Furthermore, if we look back at the teachings of our ancestors, their teachings emphasize internal cultivation, “internal sageliness and external kingship.” "Internal sageliness" means our internal cultivation has reached the level of a sage, and then “external kingship” means we can manage the family, rule the country, and bring peace to the world.  “King” refers to being the best role model, leading the entire family, society, country, and even the world in their moral character; this is called “internal sageliness and external kingship." My teacher led the unity of nine religious groups in Singapore, influencing many countries. At that time, Australia admired him greatly and awarded him honorary citizenship. This shows the increasing extent of his influence.

Our ancestors spoke of the unity of heaven and man, and the external environment and material world can be regarded as heaven.  For example, why are there so many natural and man-made disasters now? Because people's hearts are not good: “If people commit evil, they will be visited by a hundred calamities.” So what is the root cause of disasters? People’s hearts are not good. This is the fundamental problem; the entire earth and nature are corresponding to people’s hearts. “If people commit good, they will be visited by a hundred blessings.” If we do not understand the fundamental cause, no matter how much manpower, material resources, and financial resources are spent, can natural disasters truly be resolved? Are mudslides and landslides natural disasters? No, they are caused by people’s selfishness and reckless destruction of nature.

The root of all things that happen in this world lies in people's hearts.  So who can we blame?  We can't blame anyone. Why? “If people do not learn, they do not know the Way; if people do not learn, they do not know righteousness.” Our generations of Chinese children are quite unfortunate. They have not learned the ethics, morals, and good teachings of our ancestors, so they are ignorant and do these bad things, which leads to many problems for families, society, and even nature.

But if we understand it first, where do we start to create a harmonious society and harmonious world? From our own hearts. This is getting to the root of the matter. The teachings of our ancestors focused on finding the fundamental solutions to problems, like traditional Chinese medicine, which treats the root cause of the disease. Now, in our utilitarian society, what is the focus? Treating the symptoms. It’s like covering up the problems, and thinking that everything will be okay. Cutting off cancer and thinking that the problem is solved. But cancer is a sign of a body in poor condition; we’ve been abusing our body for too long, and that is the root cause. If we don't address the root cause, even if we cut out the cancer, will it come back? That's treating the symptom, not addressing the root cause. So the ancestors focused on getting to the root.

Returning to the phrase “When arguing over a matter,” conflict between family members or colleagues is a phenomenon that happens around us. Who is it related to? Ourselves, it is related to our lack of cultivation. If we had enough cultivation, we would not have conflict and friction with others. “It takes two to tango.” It’s precisely because both sides are lacking that a conflict can arise. So, from a conflict, we should bring it back to ourselves. We lack the cultivation; we do not understand tolerance, and we do not understand how to reflect, otherwise, we would be able to resolve it. If we don't know how to apologize proactively, the situation may turn into a cold war and silence.

When a problem arises, it is like the body becoming ill; we must treat it quickly. When people have friction and conflicts, we also need to treat it quickly.  The longer it’s delayed, the more it will become incurable. Why? People now are very suspicious, and can imagine there is a problem when there isn't one and turn small matters into serious ones. We must quickly and honestly communicate early on.

Someone might say, "Really, I did nothing wrong; he is the one with the bad temper." Then, can't you apologize if you didn’t do anything wrong? “I really can't take it.” I've told you a story before, about a woman in Singapore whose mother-in-law misunderstood her and scolded her. The daughter-in-law even knelt down to apologize to her mother-in-law. Many women may feel like they can't breathe after hearing this; "How can you take that?" Let’s hear how she considered this situation. She said that her mother-in-law was the family’s treasure, "Having an elder at home is like having a treasure." I resonate with this deeply. My grandparents lived with us, three generations together, and filial piety was passed down naturally. However, now, it is not easy to teach filial piety to small, two-generation families. Elders are the greatest source of blessings for the family, “filial piety is the foundation of family traditions."  Therefore, this daughter-in-law was only thinking that the elder should be healthy. When she saw the elder was angry, she felt very uneasy and only wanted to know how to calm her down, so she quickly knelt down and apologized, and the elder’s anger subsided.

Hearing this, some people may think, “How wronged she must have felt." Even her husband said, “My wife was wronged; my mother misunderstood her, yet she still knelt down and apologized." But this wife said, “I don’t feel wronged at all. Because when I knelt down, my mother-in-law was no longer angry, and my heart was at peace.” She didn’t feel wronged at all. So, why do people feel wronged? Because they put “I” first, right? “How can *I* apologize to her?” But, if you put your mother-in-law first, then apologizing becomes simple. What we find difficult to do is because we put ourselves first. Putting “I” first sounds good, but it is actually putting selfishness first. But, if we put others first, what we thought was difficult will become not difficult.

Of course, watching a play, we need to watch the whole thing. After this daughter-in-law knelt down and apologized, how would the play continue? Time reveals everything. Eventually, the truth will be made clear. The mother-in-law realized, “I misunderstood my daughter-in-law; she actually knelt down to apologize to me. A daughter-in-law like this is hard to find even with a lantern on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month.” Then, what does the daughter-in-law become?  She becomes a daughter. The daughter-in-law has another mother, and the mother-in-law has another daughter. What’s bad about that? All of this was achieved through moral cultivation.

Think about it: brothers will not call or contact each other for a year because of an issue. "It’s clearly my older brother’s fault, why should *I* apologize to him?” Again, it’s the "I" that’s the problem. I ask you, who suffers if brothers don’t contact each other for a year? Just thinking about it, their parents would lose their appetite; what’s there to argue about? That is extreme filial impiety. What’s there to argue about? So our ancestors have left us with a famous saying: “Wise people seek to be blamed; foolish people seek to be right.” When a conflict occurs, a wise person of virtue will say, “I am wrong; it’s my fault.” It is the foolish people who are always arguing about who is right. Especially family members, those who share a roof should love and care for each other, not argue about who is right and wrong. Therefore, arguing about who is right between family members will only make them angry; family members should focus on affection, and affection will foster mutual care.

This may sound a bit abstract, so for example, I’ll give a real-life example. There were two couples living across from each other. One couple was very respectful and affectionate towards each other, and their relationship was very good. The other couple had minor arguments every day and major arguments every few days. This couple, who argued often, was also very sad. The wife saw the harmony of the other couple and was very envious, so she went and asked the wife across the way, "How do you two manage to get along so well?" The other wife told her, “Your family are all good people, and our family are all bad people.” Upon hearing that, she was a bit confused. Our family are all good people, yet we argue all the time? Your family are all bad people, yet so harmonious? Are you being sarcastic? She frowned, unable to understand.

People today are not very insightful, so it's necessary to provide concrete examples.  The other wife provided an example: For instance, today, when I pour a glass of water for my husband, and he walks by and accidentally knocks it over, I will say, "Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn’t put the water in a good spot; you knocked it over.” The husband will immediately feel embarrassed, saying, "Honey, I was careless, and messed up your kindness; it was my fault.” At the same time, the wife will go and get a rag to wipe up the spill.  When the husband sees that the wife is getting the rag, he’ll try to take it away from her, “It’s my fault; let me wipe it up.”

Have you ever seen a couple break a rag arguing over who should wipe something up? If you have, then I can say that this is a sign of good fortune; it is a sign that the family is about to prosper. Because the husband and wife are both "blaming themselves, and the world will be clear and peaceful." When a situation occurs, they immediately reflect on themselves first.  See, a glass of water was knocked over, and they each reflected, admitted their fault, and went to clean up the spill.  Then, the wife will say, “Today is a rare day; I'll make a pot of white coffee; let’s have a nice chat.” See, the atmosphere at that moment is better than a five-star hotel, right? This type of atmosphere cannot be bought with money; it's a revelation of moral character, which is very moving to both.

The wife continued to say, "This is how things are in our house. In your house, the same situation would have a different outcome. If your husband knocks over the water, you will instantly get angry, saying, 'Are you blind when you're walking? Go pour your own drink!'”  People can influence each other; if the wife reflects on herself, the husband’s goodness will be activated, and he will also reflect. If the wife loses her temper, the husband's temper will also be ignited. When the husband hears that the wife is talking so harshly, he will say, "You woman, you can’t even put down a glass of tea, what else can you do?" If they start arguing, what do you think this cup of tea could turn into?  It’s hard to say. Could they divorce? It’s possible.

So, the maxims remind us, “Anger is like fire; if not contained, it will set the prairie ablaze.  Desire is like water; if not contained, it will become a flood." Human anger is like fire; if it is not suppressed, it can burn down an entire forest. Human desire is like an abyss; if not controlled, it will be like a massive flood that you cannot control. “It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality.” If people are too indulgent in pleasure, they cannot control themselves.  Therefore, "frugality and diligence are the foundation of managing a household" and "harmony is the foundation of making a home." We must prioritize the big picture and not have conflict. We must have harmony. If others are angry, accept it and do not oppose it.  Only with harmony can we bring peace to the household.

We once heard from a friend working in a government agency that he saw many young people coming in to complete divorce procedures. He was curious: "You’ve only been married a few years, why do you want a divorce at such a young age?"  After being asked this question, the couple looked at each other: “What were we arguing about last month?” They couldn't remember. But why do they want a divorce? Because their anger flared up, "I will fight you to the death!"  They have forgotten what it was all about; they just can’t swallow that anger. So people's anger destroys them and even destroys future generations. The next generation will not have a complete family to grow up in healthy and well; they have forgotten their promises to each other, and have forgotten how worried and frightened their parents are. Therefore, people must be rational!

Actually, it's not just about how husband and wives get along; it’s the same for all five relationships.  In the workplace, when any situation occurs, if you think, “I did not do a good job here,” and first reflect on yourself, instead of blaming others, maybe others in other departments will say, “I was also wrong.”  If everyone reflects on themselves, and learns from the experience, we’ll become more experienced and wiser, and it’s not a bad thing. But, if you criticize the other person, and they reply that you’re not any better, then harmony will be lost, and the organization will be like loose sand, and it will not be able to unite. "Heaven's timing is not as good as the earth's advantages; and the earth's advantages are not as good as human harmony." People with a global perspective will definitely not give in to temporary emotions.

And truly cultivated leaders, when situations happen, will not only not blame their subordinates, but will also reflect on themselves first.  In global companies, Toyota’s management is very well-known. What is the secret to their success? Since harmony among people is so important, harmony must be initiated by the leaders; they must set the example. The *Great Learning* tells us, “There has never been a case of those above being benevolent and those below not being righteous.”


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and readability.

**Translation:**

When those in positions of authority are benevolent, those below will naturally uphold righteousness. As the saying goes, "Those who are not righteous will never achieve a lasting goal." When leaders deeply value righteousness, those beneath them will rise to support them and become their strong backing.  Consider Mr. Wu Nianbo, Chairman of the Goodark Group in Suzhou. He possesses a strong sense of social responsibility. Each year, he proposes an environmental protection initiative for Suzhou.  And, he doesn't just propose ideas; he leads over four hundred of his employees, who volunteer their time, to actively contribute to society for the public good. Because he is righteous, those under him fully support him. The classics truly work; if we follow them, we can reach that ideal state.

Toyota's management, for example, educates its leaders not to scold employees first when issues arise on the production line. Instead, they first try to understand if the employee is experiencing any health problems. If health is not the issue, they ask if the employee was properly trained.  If they were taught clearly, but still make a mistake, is there an administrative process within the company that needs adjusting? They continue to reflect. If the process is fine, could it be that a family member, perhaps a parent, is ill, causing worry and making it difficult for the employee to focus on work? They always start by reflecting on these possibilities. If none of these are the cause and the employee still makes an error, what then? You teach them! The mistake has been made; you can't turn back time. You use the mistake as a lesson so they do not repeat it. When a leader is this reflective, employees are deeply moved. They feel that if they don’t do their best, they would be letting down the leader's dedication, patience, and tolerance.

Often, a person's conscience is awakened by the leadership or moral character of another. Conscience and a sense of shame are not developed by forcing doctrines upon people. The goal is to “cultivate oneself to transform others." That transformation is one of influence, not one of blame or demand. It comes naturally, like "a spring breeze turning into rain," or "a gentle rain nourishing all things,"  but the prerequisite is self-cultivation; one must truly lead by example.

In Chinese history, those who governed were considered sages. It was called the rule of sages, led by the ancient sage-kings. In the past, rulers like Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou were all sages. Our culture is unique in that saints and sages have appeared in every profession. There was Fan Li (Tao Zhu Gong) the merchant-saint who "accumulated wealth three times and dispersed it three times".  Even among merchants, there were sages who, when the nation was in peril, would sacrifice their entire wealth, being selfless and without ego. Confucius was the representative among teachers,  a sage and the most revered teacher. And are there saintly mothers? Yes. Being a mother is also a profession; it's a duty, a chosen task to benefit society.  Does being a mother benefit society? Yes, absolutely! Where do pillars of society come from?  They are educated by their mothers. "The stability of the world is largely controlled by women.” How can we have virtuous people without good mothers? So, it is through virtuous women that we have virtuous mothers, and through virtuous mothers that we have good descendants.

Fan Zhongyan’s mother taught Fan Zhongyan. How great was her merit? Is it easy to measure? Therefore, the greatest merit of parents is raising pillars of society. What is the biggest transgression of parents? It’s failing to educate their children properly, thus encouraging a culture of irresponsibility. So, the *Three Character Classic* reminds us, "If children are raised but not taught, it is the father's fault; if they are taught but not strictly, it is the teacher's laziness." This reminds us that everyone has a divine duty and a responsibility to fulfill.

To carry on the good traditions of Chinese culture, no matter what career path or role in life we choose, we should strive to move towards the ideals of sages and saints. Is it difficult? Not at all. Because our ancestors have left us examples, the classics have been passed down to us; we have theory and methodology, as well as living examples. If you say that your particular profession doesn’t have examples, I can find them for you. There are many role models in the Twenty-Five Dynastic Histories; those who have gone down in history are all good examples.

Emperors like Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang all shared this mindset: "When the myriad people err, the fault lies with me." If the people made mistakes, they would say, "Heaven, don’t blame the people; blame me, for I have not taught them well, I have not cared for them well enough.”  That is the magnanimity and virtue of a ruler.

A parent is similar. When children err, do not blame them. Instead, start by reflecting on oneself. The universe and human beings are interconnected. Your environment will change with your heart.  The mind is the root. "One’s environment will transform with one’s mindset.” Environment is like our home situation, while our mind is the core. A change in the heart will change our circumstances. I once heard a father speak from personal experience. He said that before learning about traditional culture, his child was in a terrible state, causing him constant anxiety. Later he realized that he had not provided proper guidance for his child, and that he had a bad temper. He began by adjusting himself, and by learning. Then, acknowledging his own issues, he called his wife and child together and sincerely apologized to them.  His sincerity was so profound that it touched their hearts, and his family situation changed. His son, who had lacked a sense of responsibility towards his work, was greatly moved. When he was talking to me, I was giving a lecture in Muar, and he said, "My son is now cooking meals for everyone."  He opened an organic shop and happily volunteered his time.  The transformation was tremendous.

So, the words of the sages are truths; they will absolutely not deceive us. If we follow them, putting them into practice 100% without question, we can certainly turn the tide and overcome many of life’s difficulties. This is all I will share on these two statements. Now let’s look at the next one:

[“Bestow kindness without dwelling on it. Receive kindness without forgetting it."]

When we give kindness, we think of the five constants of human interaction, the basic principles for human behavior. Our ancestors have left us a five-thousand-year-old culture, compiled and preserved in the *Complete Library in Four Sections*. The *Complete Library* is vast. Therefore, to learn the culture of our ancestors over five millennia, we must grasp the key principles: five relationships, five constants, four societal pillars, and eight virtues.  The five constants are the basic principles for human behavior, which must not be violated: “benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness.” We must have benevolence and righteousness in our hearts. Without benevolence, you're selfish; without righteousness, you're self-serving, using human form to engage in beastly behavior.  Some people are now so selfish and self-serving that they don't even take care of their parents. They are worse than a crow feeding its parents, worse than a lamb kneeling to drink milk. Aren't they wasting their humanity?  Benevolence and righteousness are virtues that everyone should possess.  Our ancestors said we should stand up for what is right. If our family or friends have difficulties, and even if we don’t know someone, we should do our duty. How can we eat when others are starving?  That’s neither benevolence nor righteousness. Some wealthy individuals, who stand idly by while others are starving, are "accumulating wealth to injure their own virtue," damaging their sense of righteousness and their basic human responsibilities.  Therefore, "to not act when one sees righteousness is a lack of courage."

What is the meaning of righteousness? Obligation - something I ought to do. Once something that one should do is done, will one dwell on it? No, it will be done "without dwelling on it." Therefore, people of righteousness, for example, a filial son, demonstrate great virtue, and it's quite interesting. A filial son behaves in such a touching way, and when others praise him for being filial, he is very humble and anxious, saying "No, I am still not doing enough."  Why? Because he feels it's what he should be doing. He doesn't think about it at all; rather he constantly demands of himself to do even better.

What one should do according to righteousness, one doesn't dwell on it. It is like your left hand helping your right hand. If our left hand helps our right hand, scratching an itch a few times, do we remember? We don't, right?  If we cook red bean soup for our children, do we remember how many times we have done it? If we lend money to a friend, do we remember it? We do remember. If we feel it is something that we should do, then we will not dwell on it. However, if we feel that "I might be at a loss" or if there is a sense of self-interest, we will remember very clearly.

Our ancestors created characters in such a way to inspire our wisdom. The character for “righteousness” (義) is a composite character, comprised of the elements for "sheep" (羊), which signifies kindness and auspiciousness, and “I” (我) which represents the self. The meaning is that the more people do good, the more they become perfected. Why? Because their virtue increases, their hearts expand, and giving is more blessed than receiving.  Not only will virtue increase, but they will also be blessed with good fortune. "A family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings to spare.”  The blessing will return to them, not only benefiting their descendants. This character “righteousness” is very meaningful. Having righteousness in life means living a virtuous life, constantly improving one's character and blessings, and doing one's best to help others and fulfill one’s duties. The most meaningful thing in life is to cultivate one's wisdom and virtue, and to help others achieve their goals – to benefit oneself and others. How wonderful that is!  But today, this is not the case. People acquire wealth and become misers. Their spirituality declines, their virtue declines, they do not help others, and they cannot benefit others.  When they pass away, others will say, "Good riddance, justice is served."  Is that a meaningful life?

History is filled with stories of how a single act of kindness resulted in a great blessing. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, there was a man named Yin Keng. He was eating dinner with friends. A server was pouring wine for them. Yin Keng was so kind-hearted that he could feel the server’s hardship of working in the service industry for possibly so long without even drinking a cup of the wine himself because he was so poor. In fact, many people who come from the countryside to the cities to work save every penny, not daring to spend anything because they have to save money for their families back home. When my father went to university, his family was very poor. He only ate noodle soup, with a lot of soup and only a little noodles, very frugal. So, Yin Keng was happy and respectfully poured a cup of wine for the server, and gave him some good food to eat. His friends looked at him strangely. “Why are you doing this?” they asked. He said, “This man has worked so long; he probably hasn’t even tasted wine, and that must be very hard on him. I would feel the same.” Later, when the Hou Jing rebellion happened, Yin Keng was captured by rebels and about to be killed when a person suddenly rushed in to rescue him and fight the rebels back. When Yin Keng thanked him, he said that he was the same person he had poured wine for before.  Bestowing kindness on others, such a small act of respect, ended up saving his own life.

There are countless such examples in history. During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a minister of Jin called Zhao Dun.  He was very loyal. Unfortunately, he served a corrupt ruler, Duke Ling of Jin, who was extravagant and wasted the people's money. Zhao Dun tried to advise the Duke, but he would not listen. In fact, the Duke held a grudge and hired an assassin to kill Zhao Dun. Every day before going to court, Zhao Dun would dress respectfully and calm his mind, waiting to go to court. When the assassin came, he saw the respect and seriousness with which Zhao Dun carried out his duties. The virtue of Zhao Dun was so evident, it moved the assassin.  He thought, “This person must be a pillar of the state; the people cannot do without him. I cannot kill him. But I have already accepted the king's command, I have no choice but to carry it out." So, he committed suicide by crashing himself into a Chinese scholar tree.

Duke Ling of Jin did not give up. He organized a banquet to invite Zhao Dun and plotted to kill him. However, Zhao Dun had once seen a man who had fainted under Mount Shouyang, because he had been starving for several days. Zhao Dun quickly gave the man food. He learned that the man had been out working for many years without success and he was just on his way home when he had fainted from hunger.  After being given food, this man put half of the food aside. Zhao Dun asked him, "Why didn't you finish it?" He said, “I haven't seen my mother in a long time. Although I am hungry, I'm worried that she has nothing to eat, so I am keeping half of the food to take home to her.” Zhao Dun was very moved. “Eat, quickly, don’t worry, I will prepare more for your mother,” he said. This is how Zhao Dun showed the man the kindness of a single meal.

Later, when Duke Ling of Jin held a banquet to kill Zhao Dun, a person suddenly came forward and said, "Three rounds of wine is enough," having realized that the ruler had set up an ambush, but the soldiers were not in position yet. He quickly grabbed Zhao Dun and ran. Duke Ling immediately released hunting dogs to attack them, but the person jumped forward, killing the dogs. He continued to lead Zhao Dun, running away. Finally, the assassins were defeated, and Zhao Dun’s life was saved. Zhao Dun was very grateful. The person said, "I am the person you gave a meal to at the foot of Mount Shouyang. I have always remembered that kindness and wanted to repay you."  This man was called Shi Mi Ming, and he was later appointed as an official in the court and had the opportunity to save Zhao Dun.

Heaven's way is fair.  In fact, helping others is helping oneself.  Why?  First, when you are helping others, your own virtue and wisdom are also being elevated. The less selfish and self-serving you are, the more your wisdom will be revealed.  Selfishness and self-interest are sources of trouble and obstacles to wisdom.  When we think of others, our troubles diminish, and our wisdom and virtue grow, as well as our blessings. In fact, loving others is loving oneself, and helping others is helping oneself. Your wisdom, virtue, and blessings are all elevated through giving, benefiting others, and bestowing kindness.  That is why our ancestors taught us that "suffering losses is a blessing," and not to haggle over every detail. If you do, your wisdom, virtue, and blessings all decrease. Frankly speaking, how many people know how to truly love themselves?  When you don't conform to the five constants of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, you are squandering your own virtue. Is that loving yourself?

“Bestow kindness without dwelling on it.” First, "bestow" means to give.  There are three kinds of giving: giving of material wealth, giving of teaching, and giving of courage. Giving wealth results in wealth. Giving teaching results in intelligence and wisdom. Giving courage results in health and longevity. We have given many examples of this before.

Giving wealth is divided into two kinds: the internal and external. Internal giving is when we use our own strength to give, or we give our own experience and life lessons. External giving is when we give our own money or possessions.  Think about how many people in the world today are starving. We go out and spend a few hundred yuan on a single meal. We only need two or three dishes to feel full. The money we save could save the lives of many.

Ms. Xu Zhe is an exceptional example. She has helped so many people without any trace of it in her heart. Why? She feels that everyone is her brother and sister, and that she has to help them. She was very capable when she was young and made good money.  Once, a friend invited her to eat at a very high-end hotel, where they drank brandy. When she came out after the meal, she saw a beggar on the street, shivering with hunger, and it shook her to the core. “He is starving, and I am eating such a luxurious meal and drinking brandy.”  That night, she looked at herself in the mirror and took off her fine clothes and put them aside. She thought, "Is the one wearing these fine clothes me, or is it the one who can think about the suffering of her fellow people?" This self-reflection is extremely important for life. Clear self-reflection will lead to a life of righteousness. Without clear self-reflection, it will lead to a life of vanity and self-indulgence.  From that day on, she didn't waste a single cent. She felt, "If I spend it recklessly, I am spending money that belongs to my brothers and sisters."

Therefore, when we have enough to eat, we should think of those who are starving; when we have enough to wear, we should think of those who are freezing; when we have houses to protect us from the wind and rain, we should think of those who are exposed to wind and rain under the bridges. They can only spend the winter under bridges when it snows.  If we can empathize with the poor, it will not be difficult to bestow kindness.

Giving wealth, teaching, and courage are really one and the same, in three forms. If you give someone teaching, for example, when a couple quarrels, and you give them good advice, so that they can resolve their differences, is that giving teaching? Yes. Is it also giving wealth? Of course, it takes time to mediate between people. Does it take physical strength? Yes. And is there also an element of giving courage?  Yes, when the couple stops quarreling, their children no longer cry, and they can sleep peacefully at night. Giving courage. If we do things wholeheartedly, many things will become complete.  When we give, we receive blessings because "blessings come from cultivating our hearts.” There are three fields of blessings: the field of gratitude -  gratitude to parents, to the country, to teachers, to all who serve society - our ancestors always said "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, and Teachers," these are the greatest fields of gratitude. The field of reverence: respecting leaders, respecting elders and teachers, respecting the work we are responsible for, being dedicated to our duty, and also respecting all life and all things, not harming or wasting anything. The field of compassion: having mercy for others, and for all living beings. We should practice all three forms of giving with hearts full of gratitude, respect, and compassion.  There is also giving with the mind. What is giving with the mind? If you don't have money but you see people giving generously, you can "rejoice in their merit." If you don’t have the means, but you have the intention to help people and protect people, that is also a form of giving. Such a mindset is the same as those who are actually giving, and the merit is equally great; that is also cultivating the field of blessings in one's heart.  Furthermore, if you tell others about how generous someone is or how good a certain act is, "Praising the good of others is a good deed," and everyone will be happy to hear it and follow suit, then the merits will continue to extend and grow.

If we cannot bestow kindness without dwelling on it, but constantly keep it in mind when helping others, and even try to demand favors, saying "I have been so good to you before,” how would others feel?  They would feel pressured. They would not feel our giving was sincere, but rather that we are always looking for something in return. So, we must give wholeheartedly, and help others sincerely. We should also have even softer hearts, considering their dignity when helping them. Some people give in a way that says “Here, take this!” And others will say, “Never mind, I don’t want it,” because they feel that the way you are helping them is arrogant, like you are bestowing charity on them. So, they would rather go hungry than accept it. Therefore, we must have respect in our hearts when helping others.

We can even be more skillful. If a brother or sister is struggling but is very proud, saying, "Hey, brother, you need money, take this!" will not work, they may not accept it. Instead, consider his self-respect, we could say to their child, "Nephew, you did so well on your test, your parents must be so relieved, here, Uncle gives you a few thousand yuan!" If we use skillful means and consider the dignity of our siblings, can they understand our intention? Yes.  This is about constantly putting ourselves in other people's shoes. Sometimes when we are doing good deeds, we are not thoughtful in these areas, and not gentle enough, or we may even be a bit forceful, forcing others to accept our help. That's not good.

I will stop sharing here for today. Thank you all!


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability, while maintaining the tone and intent of the original.

**Lecture 22: Giving Without Expectation, Receiving With Gratitude**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! Last time we discussed:

"Bestow kindness without dwelling on it; receive kindness, never forget it."

We often say that every family has its own inherited philosophy of life. The older generation often encourages us that helping others is the foundation of happiness. Therefore, when we frequently help others, our hearts are very joyful. Moreover, helping others is like planting seeds – what you sow, you reap. “Those who love others are always loved; those who respect others are always respected,” and “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” When we are willing to give, those who don’t understand might feel like they are suffering a loss. But in fact, suffering a loss is actually a blessing. Why? If you’re unwilling to give and unwilling to suffer loss, your heart becomes narrow, how can you then have blessings?

Once, a father attended his daughter's kindergarten graduation ceremony. The kindergarten teacher, wanting to show the results of her teaching, loudly asked the children, "Children, what cannot be eaten?" The children all shouted in unison, "Losses cannot be eaten!" Think about it, the children all spoke in unison, which means this concept has been taught repeatedly, many times. If children are taught from a young age that they "cannot eat losses" and are so calculative with others, what will be the consequences? From this seemingly minor detail, the kindergarten teacher’s guidance of the children's thinking can cause problems in their future lives, can’t it? In fact, if we open the newspaper today, the problems likely had their roots in their kindergarten years or at home, where the seeds of these errors were sown.

I previously saw a newspaper report about a doctoral student from a prestigious medical school who poisoned his classmate. Why? Because he could not bear to see others do well; he was jealous of his classmate. So, if you teach children competition from a young age and they cannot tolerate others being better than themselves, the consequences can be like this.

Many chaotic situations are rooted in the family or in the misguided thinking instilled in children. As parents, we must have discernment and not send children to schools where they are taught not to accept loss and are encouraged to compete. If a kindergarten teaches competition, will elementary school turn into struggle? What about middle school? It will become war, and fighting will happen frequently. Now, lives are even being lost because of it.

We were fortunate. When we were young, society was more humane. People helped each other. Even strangers would be considerate of each other’s difficulties. If someone was traveling around mealtime, our neighbors and villagers would naturally say, "Hey, come and have a meal at our place." Older grandparents would often boil a pot of hot water and place it by the roadside for people to drink. This is "bestowing kindness without dwelling on it." These are people you might only meet once in your life, just offering a cup of water, with no thought of any return. They just feel that, as a person, one should help others.

I remember a very generous lady who told me that when she was young, her cousins and siblings were together and saw their grandmother boil a pot of hot water to put by the roadside for passersby to drink. The children were all curious and hid behind a tree to see if anyone would drink it. When the first person drank it, the group of children jumped up like they had won the lottery and yelled, "Ah, someone drank it!" Then they all ran back home to tell everyone. When the children happily ran home, the seeds of this act of giving and kindness had been planted in their hearts. Why is she so generous? Because her grandmother was able to help strangers passing by, and this example influenced her descendants. So, whether descendants have good fortune really depends on the exemplary actions of their parents and grandparents.

When we give kindness, if we still think about getting a return, then that greed hasn't been eliminated. Greed means you are still thinking of yourself, and your heart is small. If we give without expecting anything in return, our hearts are vast; we see everyone as our own family. "If we adopt the mindset of our ancestors, all people in the world will live in harmony." We are all descendants of the Yan and Huang Emperors, and from the perspective of our ancestors, we are indeed one family. Especially in this era, countries, races, and religions are interacting very closely. We shouldn't be divided, or else there will be disputes, conflicts, and confrontations. When people ask my teacher where he's from, he always says he's a citizen of the world. That's very wise because everyone is his fellow citizen, everyone is a citizen of this world. This reminds us that in this era, people of the world should respect, love, care for, and help each other, working together. We cannot continue to be divided. Having this mindset of equally loving and protecting all people, all races and religions, is something that every citizen of the world should take the lead in doing today.

When our hearts are vast and expect no returns, the blessings we receive are also boundless. *The Four Lessons of Yuan Liaofan* records a story about a woman who went to a temple. She took out the only two coins she had left and, with a sincere and selfless heart, donated them to the donation box. The abbot of the temple personally came out to chant sutras, perform repentance rituals, and pray for blessings for her. Later, this woman married into the royal palace and became a concubine, becoming wealthy and powerful. Afterward, she donated several thousand taels of silver, but the abbot didn't come out; he only asked one of his disciples to chant sutras and offer blessings for her. The concubine was surprised and asked, "Before, when I only donated two coins, you personally chanted sutras for me. Now, I've donated several thousand taels. Why did you only ask your disciple to chant sutras for me?" This woman was remarkable for even questioning the abbot. The abbot then explained, "The two coins you donated before were from your sincere heart. If I hadn't come out myself, I could not have repaid your giving. This time, although you brought several thousand taels, your heart was not as sincere and had a bit of arrogance. So, asking my disciple to perform the repentance ritual is enough." Through the abbot’s explanation, this woman understood where true blessings come from. It’s from the heart, not from the external two coins or several thousand taels.

Therefore, *The Four Lessons of Yuan Liaofan* states that some people do a little good deed and keep it in their minds, telling everyone about it, which isn’t good. If you boast about it, *The Four Lessons of Yuan Liaofan* calls it "public virtue that enjoys worldly fame," and the reward is already used up. "Hidden virtue is rewarded by Heaven." If you do good deeds without bragging, you accumulate hidden virtue, and Heaven will repay you with great blessings. When we give, we don’t think about ourselves giving or who received it; after giving, we forget about it, and it doesn't stay in our minds. "Internally, we see no self; externally, we see no one being given to; in the middle, we see no object being given." This is called "the emptiness of the three wheels." When we do good deeds, our hearts are pure, untouched, and leave no trace. With the emptiness of the three wheels, "A grain of millet can sow boundless blessings; a single coin can erase eons of sins." If we give with the emptiness of the three wheels, one coin is an act of complete merit. But if we give with the intention of receiving something in return, no matter how much we give, it isn't perfect. It’s only half good, not complete good.

A true heart is selfless and joyful. A heart that seeks has the suffering of not getting what it wants. At some point, someone will think, "I've done so much, but why is there no good outcome?" Finally, they won't get what they want, and they won't want to do good anymore. If these thoughts develop, it will not be beneficial to oneself. We should still keep our sense of righteousness and consider helping others our duty. It’s what we should do, and we shouldn’t seek returns.

Helping others should be without expectation of returns, but we should never forget the kindness we receive, “receive kindness, never forget it.” We are reminded of the teaching in *Standards for Being a Good Student*, “Gratitude should be repaid, grievances should be forgotten, resentments should be fleeting, gratitude should last.” When we were young, we often heard that crows will feed their parents, and lambs will kneel to suckle. Even animals know how to repay kindness, so how much more should we, as the most intelligent of all beings, know how to be grateful and repay kindness? Otherwise, we are not even as good as animals. Furthermore, in *The Three Character Classic*, humans are listed as one of the "three powers," heaven, earth, and humanity. What does this represent? Humans should demonstrate the selflessness of heaven and earth to be worthy of being the most intelligent beings. If a person doesn't have this mindset and lacks a heart of gratitude and repayment, they are damaging their character. "For even the smallest act of kindness, we should respond with overflowing gratitude."

Indeed, the ancients kept even the smallest kindnesses in their hearts. In the late Qin and early Han Dynasty, there were three heroes of the Han Dynasty: Han Xin, Zhang Liang, and Xiao He. Han Xin was a great general. Once, he was in dire straits and hadn’t eaten for several days. He happened to meet a woman by the river. Seeing that he looked pale and as if he were about to collapse from hunger, she quickly gave him some food. After he ate, he was very touched and said to the woman, "When I become successful, I will surely repay this kindness of a meal.” The woman immediately replied, "You were so hungry. It is natural to help others. I don't want anything in return." The ancients had such motivations.

Later, Han Xin encountered another incident. In the market, he met a young man who, seeing Han Xin with a sword, wanted to challenge him, saying, "You have a sword. Do you dare draw it and kill me?" He was provoking him, “If you don't dare to kill me, then go through my legs.” Han Xin thought that he shouldn’t be so petty with this young man, or he might end up hurting someone, and they might ruin their lives. He actually went through the young man’s legs. This is what is called "enduring the humiliation of the crotch." Later, he became a great general, leading armies. He found the woman who had given him a meal and gave her one thousand taels of gold. This is the origin of the saying "a meal worth a thousand pieces of gold." Han Xin also found that young man. That young man was trembling, begging for his life. Han Xin said that he also appreciated him because it allowed him to cultivate the ability to endure. So, he gave him a position in the military. "Those who accomplish great things do not dwell on minor grievances." People who accomplish great things have vast hearts and don't hold grudges over minor things from the past. Truly, people must be able to endure humiliation to achieve great things and cultivate virtue. That young man had forced him to cultivate endurance, so he was still grateful to him. What was Han Xin’s special quality? He felt that good relationships helped him, and bad relationships improved him. He was grateful for everything.

My teacher wrote a phrase, "Live in a world of gratitude." Do we hope that starting today, every day, every second, we can live in a world of gratitude? Or do we want to live in a world of complaints, blaming and resenting? Actually, remembering each person's faults and grievances is the most foolish thing to do. Isn't that so? So, when learning the teachings of the sages, we must first understand how to love ourselves. How do we love ourselves? First, we throw away all the garbage from our hearts. The garbage truck is ready; today, let’s get rid of it all. Once it's all gone, when you go home, the people at home will feel, “Wow, you look different today. Why is your forehead shining?” Your complexion will be different. This is true, not fake; appearance is determined by the heart. Some people have been holding on to things in their hearts for years. When they finally let go, their whole face changes. So, don’t torture yourself. Let go of what you should let go of, and pick up what you should pick up. What should we let go of? "Grievances should be forgotten." What should we pick up? "Gratitude should be repaid." There is no one who isn't worthy of our gratitude; we should be grateful to everyone.

"Be grateful to those who hurt you, for they have tempered your will." People improve the most when they are in difficult situations; when in favorable situations, they tend to indulge in pleasure and become lazy. So, difficult situations temper us, and favorable situations weed people out. When people have too much to enjoy, they start to feel entitled. Their hearts become lazy. "Be grateful to those who hurt you, for they have tempered your will." "Be grateful to those who deceive you, for they have increased your wisdom." After experiencing something, you gain wisdom, so it's okay to be deceived once, but you shouldn't be deceived a second time. Our wisdom and discernment will become higher and higher. "Be grateful to those who abandon you," this is very important because many people have emotional hurts during their growth process. "Be grateful to those who abandon you, for they have taught you to be independent." These situations make us more independent, stronger, and more resilient. "Be grateful to those who trip you, for they have strengthened your abilities." "Be grateful to those who scold you, for they have helped increase your focus and wisdom." If someone scolds you for three hours over something small, and you are unmoved, then you have cultivated your skill. That person is helping us.

Letting go is not easy. How can you let go? You can only let go when you see through things. To see through something is to understand the principle. If they don’t hurt others, why hurt me? If they don’t deceive others, why deceive me? Have we ever thought about this question? Everyone has their own experiences in life. Among the many people we meet, some feel comfortable, and others make you want to punch them the first time you meet. It's strange, where does this anger come from? Everything has a cause. So, the classics tell us, "If you want to know the cause of the past life, look at what you receive in this life." Cause and effect are continuous. If you study hard when you are young, the result is that you will have good grades. Having good grades is the cause, and having a good career in the future is the result. Because you study hard and have the ability, you will do well in your career. Having a good career is the cause, and having a happy family is the result. Will this continue? Yes! So, people who understand cause and effect won’t do bad things because cause and effect are continuous.

For example, if we go out today and we are unhappy, and we see a dog and kick it, that is the cause. As a result, the dog will go and bite someone, that's the result. Then that person will feel unlucky and become angry, and at the office they will go and scold someone. Then, that becomes a result. Then, everyone who is scolded becomes unhappy and sows a bad cause. When they get home, they will beat their child, that’s a result. Now, does this beaten child have anything to do with us? It's very possible; a bad thought, extending down the line, can have negative consequences. Our ancestors spoke of "the unity of heaven and humanity." "Humanity" refers to the human heart, and "heaven" refers to our entire family, and the whole of nature belongs to heaven. If people’s hearts are unkind, then there will be many natural disasters and family discord. So, we must adjust our hearts. Why is the Earth’s temperature rising? Because our tempers are bad, so the temperature rises, and the ice melts. Living in this world, we should contribute to the world. How can we push for world floods and raise the temperature? Therefore, people who understand the principle do not get angry, they form good relationships with people, not bad ones.

Just now we talked about the continuity of cause and effect. Why don't they deceive others but they deceive me? Because there was a previous cause. Everyone, let’s think about one more thing: "It is right and proper to repay debts." The next part is "Being debt-free is a relief," is that right? So, is repaying a debt a good thing or a bad thing? A good thing. If someone scolds us today, that’s repaying a debt. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? A good thing. Good, if you understand this, congratulations. There won’t be any bad things in your life anymore. This is the truth. So, what is the truth? Everything is a good thing; everyone is a good person. People who understand the principle will have peace of mind and be at ease. People who do not understand will be unhappy every day, they will see conflict in everything, and they will feel that Heaven is unfair to them. Who is being unfair to them? Actually, it’s all their own causes and the effects that they feel. So, don't blame others; debts are being repaid. If we have a bigger heart, "Ah, it's because I formed a bad relationship with him that he is crossing me. Because he’s crossing me, he's creating more bad karma and is going to fall." Okay, I am the cause of his downfall. That’s responsibility, isn’t it? Today, if a man is a scoundrel and is creating bad karma to fall, not only will I not hold it against him, but I’ll also make sure I move him with my actions and have him study *The Zhu Family Maxims* and *Standards for Being a Good Student.* If he understands the principles and repents, he won't fall, he will rise.

The Song Dynasty monk, Budai, had a very good teaching, he said, "If someone spits in your face, let it dry by itself. It will save me the energy, and it won’t bother him." What level of cultivation have people reached? If someone spits on you, it might be because they had conflict with you before. He says let it dry by itself and not wipe it. Why? Because raising your hand to wipe it is wasting calories. So, “it will save me the energy, and it won’t bother him.” Because he spits, if you wipe it, you will not satisfy his intention. And once you wipe it, your hand rises, he might think that you’re about to fight him. Fighting is not good. If he insults you, but you don’t hold it against him, you don’t take it to heart, and when you come back from a business trip, you bring him a small gift. Wow, he’ll think, "I treated him so badly before, how come he’s so good to me?" Then his conscience will be awakened. Then he’ll wonder, "Are there still people like this in the world?” When he investigates, he’ll realize that it’s because they are studying *The Four Lessons of Yuan Liaofan* and *Standards for Being a Good Student*. Then he’ll come to study. This is meritorious, and it means that we are giving honor to the teachings of the sages. If we don’t do this and have conflicts, then we are defaming the teachings of the sages. When we truly understand the principles, being debt-free is a relief, and everything becomes a good thing. With even more cultivation, you can treat them even better. So, people now must have an attitude: whoever treats you the worst, you treat them the best. When the people around you see this, they will all be moved. What the world lacks now are role models and generous people.

Let’s look at how the Chinese character for "gratitude" (恩) is written. We often think of "cause" (因) in our hearts. Why are we still alive today? Because of the nurturing kindness of our parents. Why are we able to understand these principles? Because of the teachings of our teachers during our growth. Why are our lives stable and our families happy? Because of the protection of the country, the military, and people of all professions. If not, many countries would be in the middle of war. So, everyone receives kindness, and the most important ones are from parents, teachers, the country, the masses, and people from all walks of life. “For one day’s needs, one hundred trades prepare.” In one day, how many industries have served us? Food, clothing, housing, transportation—every item of food we eat, every dish, someone has to grow it and someone has to cook it. All of the clothes and shoes that we wear, all of the housing we use, turning on the gas, turning on the lights, someone has to provide services for all of it. If we understand these causes, and keep gratitude in our hearts, then we can face everyone with a smile every day. When we see a cleaning worker on the street, we’ll say thank you. When getting out of a car, “thank you very much,” that driver might be happy all day because he saw your bright smile. Everyone should know that cause and effect is continuous. If you thank that driver today and they are happy, even if they have a short temper or were about to have an accident, because you thanked them, their emotions might have become better, and maybe many lives have been saved. Don't underestimate your good intention. This seed will spread.

Okay, let’s start with the greatest kindness, the kindness of our parents, to feel gratitude. We can only be grateful if we are aware of the kindness, and from there, we can learn to repay the kindness. We discussed the ten kindnesses of our parents before; let’s recall them. From the time our mothers were pregnant, our parents worried about us, this is called "the kindness of protecting the fetus." The pain a mother goes through when giving birth is the worst pain in the world, this is called "the kindness of suffering during childbirth." In the delivery room, the steel poles are very thick, but mothers will bend those steel poles during delivery, which shows just how painful it is. Facing so much pain, after mothers give birth, they have “the kindness of forgetting worries for the child.” As soon as the child is born, this pain is completely forgotten. Mothers only think about if the child is healthy and well. This true selflessness, of forgetting worries, cannot be repaid with any material possession. Has our mother ever said, "It hurt so much when I gave birth to you?” No, she hasn't. Mothers truly forget their worries for their children.

As a result, mothers become even more burdened after the child is born. Before the child is three years old, they have to take care of every bowel movement. When the child wets the bed, they have to give the child the dry spot while sleeping in the wet one themselves. This is "the kindness of moving from dry to wet." All of the hardships are endured by the parents; all of the happiness and comfort of life is given to the child. This is "the kindness of swallowing bitterness and spitting sweetness."

Then, there is "the kindness of nursing and nurturing." When mothers breastfeed, over two or three years, it adds up to hundreds of kilograms of milk. This is why women's bones are darker because they are more depleted in the process of nurturing children. "The kindness of washing away the unclean," which is helping us wash diapers, wash all those dirty things. After we grow up, “the kindness of worrying during faraway travel,” when we are far away, our parents often worry about us; "the kindness of being deeply concerned," they are always thinking of us. When we come home from college, the first thing mothers say is, "Oh, you look so thin." And as soon as we come through the door, we’ll see our favorite food and dishes. Mothers always hope to make it up to us in the few days we are home.

Then there is “the final compassion and kindness.” Even when mothers reach one hundred years old, they will still worry about their eighty-year-old children. Even when parents are dying, they will still be thinking of their children.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I have aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow, while also capturing the nuances of the original text.

**Translation:**

I know an elderly woman who had cancer. Her mother, in her eighties and nearing the end of her life, said to her daughter, "I hope that after I pass, I can take your illness with me." The daughter was deeply moved. It was true, the mother’s compassion extended to her daughter even at death's door. Miraculously, after her mother passed, this elderly woman’s health slowly improved. A sincere heart can move the heavens. It's clear that the daughter was constantly thinking of her mother’s love, and her cancer gradually healed. This shows the profound kindness that parents bestow upon us.

If we think about it, as we were growing up, when we were sick, or during our education, our parents even borrowed money for our studies. When we looked for work, they worried about whether we could get along with colleagues, or listen to our superiors, or not cause any trouble for others. Our parents are very considerate, always afraid of inconveniencing people.  Even after we marry, they worry about whether our marriage is harmonious. After we have children, our parents then worry about the lives of their grandchildren. These are all forms of parental kindness towards us. They not only care about us, but also our careers and families. When you calmly reflect on it, the kindness of our parents is immeasurable. Even their daily actions are expressions of their love and care.

We should turn this awareness of kindness into action. We should be grateful and reciprocate. How do we repay? By nurturing our parents’ physical well-being, their hearts, their ambitions, and their wisdom.  “Nurturing their physical well-being” means taking good care of their daily needs: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation.  First, regarding food, we must pay attention to soft, warm, and slow. The elderly’s teeth are not as strong, so food should be cooked until it’s tender and not too hard.

A friend of mine always bought nuts for his parents when he went home.  One day his mother couldn’t take it anymore and said, "Son, those things you buy are so hard, your father can’t even bite them. I think you buy them because you like to eat them yourself!" He was immediately embarrassed. So, the phrase “in winter, keep them warm; in summer, keep them cool,” should be taken to encompass all things. Don’t learn this phrase and think that filial piety is just about noticing whether your parents are cold or hot, and ignore everything else. It's about understanding their needs in terms of food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. And, you need to be meticulous in this. Food should be soft. Furthermore, they shouldn’t eat cold food as it’s not good for their digestive system, so it must be warm. Of course, it shouldn’t be too hot either, this all needs to be done with their health in mind. Additionally, it needs to be slow – they must eat slowly and chew well so they can digest the food. When eating with the elderly, do not eat too quickly. If a child finishes and just watches the elderly person, it puts pressure on them. Telling them to hurry, hurry can even cause stomach prolapse. When people are tense, their stomach doesn’t feel well. I feel that whenever I eat quickly, my stomach feels like it’s tightened. I can immediately sense it, so it’s even more important to understand everyone’s situation, especially the elderly at home. When eating with elderly, deliberately eat slower, slower than they do. This way, they won’t feel any pressure. We should always be considerate in every possible way.

Regarding clothing, in China, we have spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Generally, in spring and autumn, we should add more clothes when the season changes. This also includes buying clothes for our parents. If our parents are frugal, we should be considerate of them. For example, if we buy clothes for 300 yuan, and our mother finds out, she'll feel bad every time she wears them. "300 yuan!" You can tell her, "Mom, I got them for 50 yuan." Your mother will say, "Still a little expensive, but they are very nice." She'll be happy. And then she will say when she puts them on, “Buy me another one!” And you should immediately go and buy her another one. In the old days, when a filial child’s parent said, “This is delicious, is there more?” Even if there wasn't, they would say yes and go find some. Why? Because when people get old, their digestive system is not very good. When they do like something, it makes the child happy.  Zengzi was a model of filial piety. The *Classic of Filial Piety* was passed down from him, and he lived up to its teachings.

Then there is housing. The environment where the elderly live should not be slippery, especially the bathroom. The elderly’s bones aren’t very strong, and they are afraid of falling. Sometimes a fall can make them unable to walk. So, the bathroom should have anti-slip equipment. In mainland China, there are even shoe companies producing shoes called "filial piety shoes." I’ve seen those shoes, the soles are specially designed so that no matter how slippery the ground is, they won't slip. And the insoles are very thick and soft, making them very comfortable for the elderly to wear. You should also pay attention to the location of their dwelling. Do not have them live too high, and if they do live on a higher floor there should be an elevator. Temperature, humidity, and ventilation also need to be considered to avoid impacting their health. This is all about being considerate regarding their daily needs: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation.

Next, we must “nurture our parents’ hearts.” We should not do anything that would worry them. “Injury to the body causes parental grief,” so we must take good care of our health. “A flaw in virtue brings parental shame,” for if we lack morality, we bring shame upon our parents for the rest of their lives. This is a great act of filial impiety. We shouldn’t allow our parents to feel neglected. No matter how busy we are, we must sit with our parents and keep them company when we get home. Even if it’s only ten minutes, our parents will understand our precious filial devotion. We must not allow our parents to feel fear. If there is something that frightens them, we should take care of it immediately so that they no longer feel afraid. Always consider any burdens that may weigh on their minds, and quickly help them to let go of those burdens.

We should do more things that make our parents happy. If we are successful in our studies and careers, if our marriages are harmonious, and if our siblings are united, then our parents will be very at peace. There is a saying, "What our parents desire, we should continue; what our parents value, we should cherish." When parents "desire," it’s often what they long for and is their ambition, we should “continue,” like Mr. Shen Muyu. His father gave him this name, admiring Guan Yu. And Mr. Shen lived up to that by making great contributions to the passing down of national culture. He inherited his father's ambition, which is truly commendable. Some parents leave their hometown but the people there have been good to them, for example, they may have helped look after their ancestral graves. Therefore, every year they would send money back home. This is also what our parents desire. Knowing this, and seeing that their parents are getting old and might be leaving soon, one might reassure them and say, “Mother, don't worry, after you're gone, we'll continue to express our gratitude to the people of our hometown." This falls under the category of "What our parents desire, we should continue." “What our parents value,” our parents not only care about us, but also our siblings, even our nephews and nieces. As people get older, they become more and more compassionate, and they will think of their children and grandchildren. If we can be considerate of our parents' hearts, and care for not only our siblings but also the next generation and guide them towards learning the teachings of our ancestors. Wow! When our parents see that the grandchildren are all sensible, and the family is prosperous, they will be very pleased and satisfied every time they see us. This falls under the category of "What our parents value, we should cherish."

Many of our previous generations were very kind. Some of our nephews and nieces needed to study, and since it was near their homes, they would take them in to live with them for four years and take care of them. The parents would be very happy about this and the siblings would feel very grateful. It's such a blessing when your children are out of town, to know they are being taken care of by family. I also heard a story from an older student. She studied for five years and lived in her teacher's house. This teacher was also very kind. When they went to celebratory banquets, he brought her along with his two sons. So she was completely integrated with their family, like another daughter. It's not just parents who impact a person's character, teachers also have a great influence. She eventually became a university professor and took teaching very seriously. This is nurturing the heart, ambition, and wisdom.

As we get older, it’s important to have fewer worries in order to be truly happy. When worries diminish, wisdom will grow. Why do we have so many worries? Most of our worries come from what? Greed. When you can’t get what you want, it causes suffering. If you are not greedy, then there will be no suffering. “When you know contentment, your troubles are quickly gone.” Contentment brings happiness. If you are not seeking, then what belongs to you will still be yours. If you seek, then what is not yours, you still won't obtain. If there are no desires, then your mind and body will be light and at peace. If you have desires, then you will worry a lot before you achieve them. You have to understand these principles. When you understand them, you’ll see through it, let go, stop torturing yourself, and be free and easy. When everything happens naturally, without forcing it, things will fall into place.

Confucius warned us of three things to guard against: "In youth, when the blood and *qi* are not settled, guard against lust." The issue of lust can destroy a nation's future generations. This problem is very serious now, so parents and teachers must give children proper guidance. "Do not look at inappropriate books, so as not to cloud intelligence and ruin their morals.”  Especially, Dr. Peng Xin of Traditional Chinese Medicine spoke very clearly about how indulgence in desire can damage your character and your health. We must educate our children on this. Otherwise our nation will truly decline. Our ancestors left us with this saying, "Of all good deeds, filial piety comes first. Of all evils, lust is the greatest."

"In adulthood, when the blood and *qi* are vigorous, guard against conflict." When men become adults, they often can't stand seeing others succeed. If you praise another man, he will think "I'm no worse than him.” Such a mindset is not good and will lead to conflict. What should we do? Appreciate others, praise others, and learn from others. That is the right approach. "In old age, when the blood and *qi* are weak, guard against greed." As we get older, we often become fearful of losing things, guard against greed. So we must advise the elderly that worldly possessions are all temporary, they can't take anything with them. Do not be forceful, inner peace is the greatest blessing.

Especially after one is older, don't compare yourself with others. Concentrate on self-cultivation, cultivating a pure heart. This is how you enjoy your later years. Everything is good, everything is pleasing. The most important of the five blessings is "a good end." When you approach the end of life without being sick and your mind is still clear, you know where you are going, isn't that ideal? Do you all want that? Yes. You have to start working on that now. Don't wait until old age to let go of attachment. You have to stop polluting your mind and being greedy now. Young people need to cultivate their character, otherwise their mind and body will be calculating and scheming, and eventually they will have bad health in their old age. The biggest factor affecting a person's health is their emotions. When they are unhealthy and bedridden for a long time, they still can't let go of possessions, their houses, and so on. "What am I going to do?” they keep thinking. They drag it on until the end and lose all awareness. Most people these days die in a delirious state. Muddled and confused. What will happen to them after that? Very dangerous, very, very dangerous.

I'll give you an example of a historical figure who departed very peacefully. The *Three Character Classic* states, "Dou Yanshan had a good method and he taught his five sons and all their names became known.”  He is a famous historical figure. Mr. Fan Zhongyan even taught his children to emulate Dou Yanshan. Dou Yanshan was in his thirties, and was destined not to have children and to die young. His grandfather appeared to him in a dream to remind him, "You must quickly stop doing evil and start cultivating goodness and accumulating merit. Otherwise, your lineage will be cut off and your life will end soon." Fortunately, he listened to his grandfather. When he woke up, he went all out and dedicated himself to doing good. Eventually, his destiny changed. “Five Sons on the List” refers to him. And he lived to be over eighty years old. One day, after taking a bath, he came out and said goodbye to his relatives and friends, “I am leaving. You all take care." After that, he sat down in his chair, closed his eyes, and passed away. A peaceful passing without any illness, his mind clear. Do you admire him? My teacher was eighty-seven years old and had such bright eyes! So wise and intelligent, not confused at all. That definitely comes from spiritual practice.  Our parents cannot give us such wisdom and virtue.  In fact, after forty years of age, our appearance and destiny depend on our own efforts. Okay, this is what I wanted to share regarding the kindness of our parents.

Now let’s talk about the kindness of our teachers. Through their teachings, we are able to distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, correct and incorrect, beneficial and harmful. “One point of sincerity and respect will bring one point of benefit." When we are very respectful to our teachers, we will receive the greatest benefit. I remember when I was in middle school, my science teacher said, “People should not be arrogant, but they must have backbone." Such teachings, heard when you are young, can be very helpful. When we are still young, we don't have advanced degrees, and we haven't achieved anything in our careers, so we are not arrogant yet. The seed of not being arrogant was planted in our hearts. We are impacted by these words of our teacher for the rest of our lives. But we must not lack backbone. We must have ambition and backbone. So this teaching of our teacher makes it easier for us to not give up easily or be depressed, but to lift our spirits. Like the *Doctrine of the Mean* says, “If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times.” If others can do it in one try, it's okay, I'll do it a hundred times, and I will also be able to do it. "There's nothing hard in this world, but one must only be determined." "If others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times.” If others can do it in ten tries, that's okay, I’ll do it a thousand times, and I’ll still be able to do it. If people truly have this kind of attitude, even if they were born more ignorant, they can become wise. Even if they were weak, they can become very strong.

Teachers give us wisdom, parents give us life. These forms of kindness impact us throughout our lives and must not be forgotten. In fact, parents and teachers make sacrifices without asking for anything in return. The most important way we can reciprocate them is to make them feel gratified, to let them know, “Their time wasn’t wasted on this student.” There is no other way to repay the kindness of our teachers other than to put their teachings into practice. To truly become pillars of society and people who will continue our culture, will be the greatest comfort for our teachers. We must never be self-destructive and we must not be two-faced. We cannot just do things on the surface. If our parents and teachers find out about that, it will break their hearts. This is what it means to understand and repay the kindness of our teachers.

Then there is the kindness of our nation. Where can we contribute to our nation? By fulfilling our roles and responsibilities, that is how we can repay the kindness of the nation. If I can maintain harmony in my family, the family is a cell of society. What is the greatest contribution that parents, who form a family, can make to society?  It is to raise their children to be virtuous people, so they will become pillars of society. That's the greatest merit and contribution. What is the biggest transgression for parents?  It is not to raise their children to be virtuous, then their children will lack virtue, which might harm a lot of people. If we do not teach our children properly, then we are contributing to the trend of not educating our children and that is also not good. Therefore, to "fulfill our roles and responsibilities," we must fulfill our obligations and take good care of our family and future generations.

In addition to our family responsibilities, there are also the relationships between ruler and subjects, the relationships between superiors and subordinates in companies, as well as the relationships with our colleagues and friends. We must handle all of these relationships well. Our homes, our communities, and our workplaces can become examples of how to implement ethical morality. That is the greatest contribution we can make to our nation. Because right now, the problems of our country and society lie in people’s hearts. People lack the education of classical texts. However, to have people learn the teachings of the sages, we must first make them believe that those teachings are useful. When we set an example and show them that "learning this can bring family happiness, learning this can bring career success," will they learn? Yes! Our example gives others the confidence to learn. This is how we make a contribution to our nation.

Finally, there is the kindness of the public and the kindness of all professions. If we do our best in our own positions and serve everyone wholeheartedly, this also repays their kindness. And, when we receive services from others, we should hold a respectful and grateful heart. If every profession receives gratitude for their efforts, then I believe everyone in every profession can become an outstanding talent, living out their life's values through their work, and earning the respect of others. Then our society will be very harmonious. There won't be a situation where those with money talk loudly and look down upon others. These kinds of things will disappear.

Alright, that is all that I wanted to share with you today. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and natural English style:

**Lecture 23: The Importance of Leaving Room for Maneuvering**

Respected elders and friends, hello everyone! The last saying we studied was, “Give kindness without thinking, receive grace without forgetting.” In the *Geyan Lianbi* (a collection of moral maxims), it mentions, "All things being one is called benevolence.” When we view all people and all living things as part of ourselves, we will do our best to cherish and help them, without calculation or holding onto the idea that we have helped. It’s like your left hand helping your right hand - when it scratches an itch or applies medicine, the left hand definitely doesn’t keep it in mind or ask for a reward. If it were to think, "Ten dollars for every scratch," the body would become ill. Heaven, Earth, and Humanity are the three powers. Heaven and Earth nurture all things without seeking anything in return. Humans, being one of the three powers, should also use a selfless heart to cherish and help all people and all living things. We should be too busy helping to even consider causing harm.

"Receive grace without forgetting." In reality, knowing gratitude and repaying kindness is the driving force of life. Living each day in the process of repaying kindness is the happiest way to live, feeling grounded and never letting those who love and nurture us down. The ancients reminded us of a precious life attitude, "Repay a single drop of kindness received with a gushing spring."

How do we practice "receive grace without forgetting?” Write down each day who has been kind to you that day. People are often forgetful in their busy lives. Writing it down each day will bring joy, and if you reflect each night on the acts of kindness you received, you're guaranteed to sleep soundly and peacefully, and even have beautiful dreams. Normally, after being busy all day, our minds are restless, with many unpleasant things weighing on our hearts, causing us to toss and turn in bed, unable to sleep. Cultivating this habit means you won't need sleeping pills. As you reflect on who was kind to you that day with a joyful heart, thinking “Ah, I am truly the happiest person in the world,” you will fall asleep. You might even dream that Confucius is touching your head, saying, “This child can be taught!”

Also, during holidays, when you can truly quiet your heart, take the time to reflect on your parents' kindness over the past decades. This will be a cleansing of your soul. Many forgotten memories will surface, and you will realize, "Ah, my mother had it so hard, my father worked so hard." The lyrics of the "Kneeling Lamb" picture say, "The father's body is ill, the child’s labor made him so." Why is the father sick? From overworking for the entire family. "The mother's heart is worried, it is worried that the child will not become successful." Why is the mother worried? Because we still have many bad habits and bad tempers that we haven't changed. When we go to work or travel away from home, mothers are often anxious. What if their child gets into another conflict? Therefore, those who truly want to repay their parents' kindness should thoroughly change their bad habits. Otherwise, reciting kindness is just lip service. Truly, our parents are heaven and earth to us.

My mother, in my memory, only seemed to have been sick once, lying in bed with an IV drip. At that moment, I felt like the sky was falling. Therefore, parents are so tall and great in our growing process. When my mother was sick, I felt as though the world had turned dark. If it was my father who was sick, I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep. My father has never been bedridden in his life. We have to thank the ancestors' blessings. My father pays attention to his health and even now, in his seventies, is very careful about diet, exercise, and sleep. Therefore, when we quiet our hearts and reflect on the many things that have happened during our growth, we can understand that our parents’ kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea.

Next, let’s reflect on all the teachers who cherished and taught us throughout our growth. I hope everyone this Chinese New Year will think of all the elders who have cared for you. Perhaps you lived together in childhood but do not anymore. However, that kindness, their having held you and lifted you up - we must go to visit them this new year. When they are touched, you can also introduce them to *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims*, *Standards for Students*, and *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*. This is called "explaining the truth to others," truly expressing knowledge of kindness and repayment of grace. People will feel confident and think, "Indeed, the teachings of our ancestors are great. This person used to be so heartless, but now they value kindness and old relationships."

Also, go visit the teachers who once taught us. This is something concrete that can be done, to reflect on the kindness of everyone, and it can start with the New Year visits. In addition, remember to reflect on kindness before sleeping. "Daily, know what you lack, and monthly, don’t forget what you’re capable of." What we have learned should be reviewed often. The next sentence speaks about:

**[Leave Room for Maneuvering in All Matters.]**

These are all important points of discretion when handling matters, the cultivation needed for advance and retreat. People who do not know how to advance and retreat will conflict with others and experience disasters. When dealing with matters, you should leave room for maneuvering and maintain the proper balance. Therefore, *Geyan Bielu* (Another collection of maxims) tells us, "Do not do things to the extreme, and do not express words to their full extent." These two sentences are very meaningful. Things should not be done to the point of no return. There is an idiom called, “Do not pursue a desperate foe.” If the enemy has already been defeated, don't kill them all. They may retaliate, possibly bringing disaster. So, things should not be done to the point of bullying others.

We can see that people who leave room for maneuvering will not make others feel embarrassed, will leave them a way to save face. This is being kind and generous. Kind people will certainly have future blessings, while callous people will diminish their blessings. What kind of people are increasing their blessings daily? Those whose hearts align with Heaven’s heart, these are the people who will have blessings. Heaven is selfless, and selfless people are blessed. What Heaven abhors the most is “what the Creator detests, is callousness and craftiness.” Being too callous goes against Heaven's heart, and “craftiness” means selfishness. To use cunning methods to seek personal gain, and even potentially frame others – such people will bring disaster upon themselves. We must not be callous. We should be kind and generous, and be considerate of other people’s positions and feelings at all times. If they are in great distress, you must comfort them. If they are in great distress, and you still make fun of them and humiliate them, that is too excessive.

During the Han Dynasty, there was a man named Liu Kuan. His name was well chosen, representing his father’s hope that he would be forgiving and generous. He strove to embody this attitude and virtue since childhood. Liu Kuan truly did not let his father's expectations for him down.

Liu Kuan was an official. One day he was riding in his ox cart when a farmer came up to him suddenly, saying, “This ox is mine. How can you steal my ox? You need to return it to me.” Liu Kuan was suddenly questioned and said, "I am so sorry. Please take it, please take it." And indeed, he let the person take his ox, and he walked on foot. Later, the farmer returned home and realized that his ox had returned. He was very embarrassed, and even more ashamed when he learned the man was an official. He hurried to take the ox back to Liu Kuan.

When he got there, he naturally knelt down and begged for forgiveness, "Sir, I am so sorry. I was wrong." He was already so flustered and humiliated. What should one do? If you were to say, "Kneel and don’t get up!", then you are using the situation to take advantage. But a kind person thinks of others at all times, and will not hold onto grievances. He immediately said, "Hurry up and get up. Oxen do look very similar. It's normal for you to mistake it. Oh, thank you, and thank you for bringing it back for me." How kind and generous! He left the man with a way to save face. Think about it, upon hearing that, that farmer must have cried with emotion. When this farmer returned home, he probably told everyone he met, “Liu Kuan is a good man! A good man!” and spread the official’s kindness everywhere. Liu Kuan's generous and exemplary actions taught the people, moving many in the area.

Let’s look at another example. King Zhuang of Chu was one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period and a very accomplished ruler. He was patient, able to yield and persevere, and the history books say, he was silent for three years, but when he spoke, he was astonishing, and when he took flight, he soared to the sky. He remained dormant for a long time before emerging and making his mark. Therefore, we must understand the importance of accumulating strength. Do not always seek to achieve fame and fortune at a young age. It's like a tree; the deeper its roots, the taller and more lush it grows. Small grass grows quickly, but its roots are shallow and it is easily uprooted.

King Zhuang of Chu’s success was due to the fact that he left room for maneuvering in all matters. As the ruler of a kingdom, he was respectful to his subordinates. I have told you this story before: King Zhuang was hosting a banquet for his officials, when the lights went out, and in the dark, a concubine was sexually harassed. She tore the other person's hat string. She then asked the king to light a torch to find the offender.

Sometimes when people do things, they need to think not only of the person in front of them, but even further ahead. If the torch had been lit immediately, how would that person have been able to live among people afterwards? Everyone would know that he had dared to harass even the king's concubine. He would not have had any other way to live. It would be like forcing that person to die. So, one should refrain from speaking ill of others and instead leave people with an opportunity to correct their mistakes. "Everything that concerns a person's whole life," even though you have witnessed or heard about it, do not speak of it all the time. If you constantly say "he used to be unfilial to his parents" or "he was once divorced," you will cause them to lose face and have no way of living among others. You have to look at the latter part of the story; a prodigal son who returns is more precious than gold. Moreover, ethical moralities, and Chinese culture have been somewhat neglected in the last two or three generations. People have not learned and do not know right from wrong. You have to be able to forgive and tolerate the mistakes people made. Actually, not only others, we have all made mistakes over the decades, and do you hope that others will spread the words about your mistakes? “What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others”. You should leave people with a way to change.

Luckily, King Zhuang was not influenced by the concubine. He told all the officials, "Today we will not stop until we have all had a great time, and everyone must remove their hat strings before returning.” Everyone upon hearing this tore their hat strings. When everyone removed theirs, no one knew who the culprit was, and that was how he kept others from losing face. Later, in the battle between the Kingdom of Chu and Jin, the very same person charged into battle to rescue King Zhuang.

The story is now complete. The conclusion is: Leaving room for maneuvering for others saves your own life. Does this make sense? This is a calculation you need to know how to do. From another perspective, not leaving room for maneuvering for others is equivalent to killing yourself. Maybe it's not just yourself that will die, if you do things to the extreme, "what goes around comes around", and you will eventually get "the household that accumulates evil will be left with endless disasters," maybe even to the point of not having descendants.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, in a place called Gaoyou in Jiangsu, there was an official surnamed Xu who was very harsh. He did not forgive people. Whenever his subordinates made mistakes, they were punished severely. In his department, the rules were that anyone who was one day late in completing his work would receive five lashes with a large rod. This man’s subordinate was six days late, and was given thirty lashes. The subordinate was certain he would die from that kind of beating. He pleaded with the officer, and asked if the lashes could be administered in parts, but the officer would not agree. There was no room for maneuvering, and the punishment had to be completed in one session. Before the lashes were finished, the man was beaten to death. When his family received the news, his son was so frightened that he died as well. His wife, having watched her husband and child die in one day, hung herself, and the family of three died.

Later, the official with the surname Xu took his only son home. He doted on this only child of his. After a short while, his son became sick. When he was sick, he constantly cried out in alarm, "Do not chase me, do not chase me," and he died. Xu also died not long afterwards. This is why "things should not be done to the extreme" is very reasonable.

Also, in ancient times, there was an official named Xi Xiandu. He was in charge of some of the national construction projects, and many people were sent to perform labor. He was very harsh. In order to curry favor with the emperor, he rushed the projects, not allowing the people to rest. He did not allow them to rest during the hot summers, or during the freezing cold winters. Many people were so exhausted that they were forced to end their lives. Later, he was also convicted of his crimes and executed. Therefore, one cannot not leave room for others. Gradually, such evil actions will accumulate, and finally, disaster will descend. "Good deeds not accumulated are not enough to achieve fame, and evil not accumulated is not enough to destroy oneself.” When evil is constantly accumulated, disaster will eventually descend.

Therefore, we should cherish and respect those under our care, and others, and “cherish the mind of respect and love.” Respected elders and friends, we must remember these four words when studying *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*. If you remember these four words, you have grasped the whole book of *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*. All good deeds are inseparable from a heart of love and respect, treating people, things, and objects with a heart of love and respect.

During the Ming Dynasty, Yang Wanli’s wife, in her seventies, would get up early in the morning in the cold Northern weather to cook warm porridge for her servants to eat. Her children could not bear to watch their mother toil like this. She told her children, "If they have an empty stomach when they go to work in the early morning during the winter, it will really harm their bodies. To let them have some hot air in their stomachs will be better for them.” Other people are also the children of parents. How can we be so harsh? Therefore, this is “benevolent leadership.” A leader should be benevolent. Later, she had four sons who were very blessed, and three of them passed the imperial examinations. *Standards for Students* says, “Treat servants with a dignified attitude, and while one must be dignified, one must also be kind and tolerant”. Where does a person's nobility lie? It lies in benevolence and tolerance. A person's nobility does not lie in status, but in actions that are in accordance with morality. If a person's position is high, but his actions are not in accordance with morality, he will be looked down on. How can he be considered noble? While he was in office, many may curse him, much less after he is dead, when he will leave a bad name in history.

Some families may have servants and maids. The classics tell us, how should we treat them?

First, we must always be considerate of their hunger, thirst, cold and heat. If they are thirsty, hungry, cold, or hot, we must be considerate, and then ask them to work. We also have to assess how much they can withstand. Therefore, the leaders of the past cherished their subordinates just like parents cherish their children and elder brothers cherish their younger brothers. They empathized with them.

Second, when they are sick, you must take them to the doctor and make sure they are cured.

Third, do not be quick to blame or punish them. You still have to ask clearly about what happened. If the mistake was small, you should be tolerant, and for bigger mistakes, you have to properly admonish them, so they understand and do not make the same mistake again. Why do we need to ask clearly? Sometimes, when we see an action, we immediately make judgements and may misunderstand the people below us. If this happens, they will feel very wronged. Resentment will eventually form. Therefore, "to subdue people by power, their hearts will still not submit, but to convince them with reason, then they will have nothing to say".

Fourth, if they have some personal belongings, you should not use your position to seize those belongings.

Fifth, be fair when giving gifts to your subordinates, and do not be partial. This makes perfect sense. If those who work very hard are given less while those who only know how to flatter you are given much more, how can anyone feel that this is fair?

This is speaking about how to treat those below us, and our servants. If we do not have this mind of love and respect, we will commit limitless evil acts if we have wealth and status. We should not be so harsh to others even without such high positions. So, it is important to understand the truth.

Now we see children who hit and kick their nannies. Such children will have problems in the future. Even though a family may have money, one must know how to respect elders, and respect those who have been kind to them. Not only should we leave room for maneuvering for other people, we should also leave room for maneuvering for living things.

*Qun Shu Zhi Yao 360*, sentence 314, mentions, “A bird cornered in a difficult situation will use its beak to peck. A wild beast driven into a dead end will retaliate with its claws. A human being driven into a dead end will use fraudulent methods. A horse driven into a difficult situation will run away.” This means, even if these horses and cattle are serving us, we must treat them well, and treat living things well. The key point here is that from ancient times, there has never been a ruler who was harsh to his subjects, but himself was not in danger. "Water can carry a boat, it can also capsize it." Those who do not treat their citizens well will surely be overthrown. Those who do not care for their employees will see their businesses go bankrupt sooner or later. The ancients knew how to empathize with all living things. They remembered the kindness and were very generous.

Looking at Buddhist history, Buddhism was introduced to China in the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Yongping of the Eastern Han Dynasty, and the first Buddhist temple was called the “White Horse Temple”, which was specifically for promoting Buddha's teachings. The term "temple" refers to a unit directly built and managed by the emperor. There is a story behind all of this. The first temple was called "White Horse Temple," because it was a white horse that carried the sutras back. Because of the long journey, it died of exhaustion. The emperor was able to remember its kindness, because the sutras that were carried in would unlock our wisdom. The things the ancients did gave the future generations great inspiration and guidance for life.

Therefore, during the agricultural era, cows were highly respected because they plowed the fields, which allowed us to have food. “Dogs guard the night,” which protect our safety. Animals that are kind to humans must be cared for, and must not be harmed, much less killed. Thus, the ancients said, "Heaven loves life, and all beings love their lives." All living beings love their bodies. They do not want to die, even down to the smallest ant.

In ancient Hangzhou, there was a woman who had a very bad temper. When she saw ants, she would burn them all to death. When she saw an earthworm hole, she would fill it with lime powder. Lime powder heats up when it comes into contact with water, so when it rained, the lime powder would flow into the hole and burn the earthworms to death. Because she hurt living things in this way, "what goes around comes around.” One day she walked into her child’s room and saw that the baby, who was only a few months old, was covered in black from a distance. She was terrified and rushed over to see that the child was being eaten alive by ants. He was already dead. She only had this one child, so she was very sad. She also died violently.

Everyone has to understand that like causes lead to like effects. “If you plant melons, you will reap melons; if you plant beans, you will reap beans.” Nothing in this world is a coincidence. They are all causes and effects that are connected. Giving the gift of wealth leads to receiving wealth. People who are happy to help others naturally receive great blessings. Giving the gift of the Dharma leads to receiving wisdom. When people are always giving wisdom to others, they will naturally become smarter. The gift of fearlessness, which means cherishing life, not causing fear to others, and not harming life, leads to health and long life. Ms. Xu Zhe had been a vegetarian since she was in the womb, and she lived to be 114 years old, and this is proof. How can a person who harms so many lives every day hope to live long? How can her children not face disasters? Therefore, we must abstain from killing and we must not hurt lives. Things should not be done to the extreme, and we should not go to extremes with other living things.

Furthermore, “do not express words to their full extent”. When speaking, you should be restrained, should speak implicitly, and should stop at the point of understanding. Do not speak until the point where you humiliate people and cause them to be unable to live among others. Therefore, when speaking in a crowd, you must leave room for maneuvering if you are aware of the background of those people. For instance, if you know they are poor, you must be careful and considerate of their feelings and taboos. Also, during a conversation, if someone has a congenital disability, you should not talk about the topic, or it may cause them great suffering. We must always be considerate and meticulous. When people become emotional, they easily speak to extremes. Therefore, "do not promise people gifts when overly happy and do not reply to a letter when angry.” When you are very happy, do not easily promise others things. When you are too happy, you may say "Come, let's have a drink, I will take care of everything!” But it might not be within your authority, and this will be very embarrassing. You may make a fool out of yourself.

When very angry, do not write a letter or a text message to others. When you calm down, you may realize that you were too emotional. Before you speak, write a letter, or write a text message, calm your heart. Otherwise, you may send a text message and regret it later. We have to control our temper. "When a single thought of anger arises, millions of obstacles open." It is very difficult to clean up the mess after having a temper. "Three years of friendship, one word that cools the heart." One single harsh sentence can cause two people to not see each other the next day, and that is because one was unable to control their temper.

How can we overcome that? We have talked about the six types of patience before, let’s review: first, to bear it with force, "Do not be angry, do not be angry, do not be angry...." bear with it. Second, to forget it, “Ah, forget it.” a prime minister's belly can support a boat. Third, to reflect, "When you have conflicts with others, how do you know it is not your fault? You must reflect calmly in silence.” Anger will slowly dissipate. The fourth is to contemplate, the fifth is to rejoice, and the sixth is to be kind. "Contemplate" means not focusing on the behavior of the person who is yelling at you, and instead considering the history of the situation, that there must be some reason for this person to act this way. There is something pitiful behind every hateful person. Perhaps their mother passed away when they were young, or perhaps other reasons, and therefore do not understand common sense. Do not dwell on the issue with this person.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, striving for accuracy and a natural English flow, while maintaining the tone of the original speaker:

**Why We Suffer: Learning Forgiveness, Compassion, and Joyful Acceptance**

The reason we can’t endure things often boils down to the thought, “How can he do this? How can he scold me?”  We get stuck in that constant mental loop. But, forgiving others is actually freeing yourself. Otherwise, you'll find yourself waking up angry every day. To be honest, if you can’t forgive others, you’re truly not forgiving yourself.  So, people are often the source of their own suffering.

*Ci Ren* (compassionate tolerance) means thinking from the other person’s perspective. He’s acting foolishly, which is pitiful. So, not only do we not argue with him, but even if he’s rude to you, you should put yourself in his shoes and do your best to help him. Later, when he understands, he'll be overcome with remorse.  *Xi Ren* (joyful tolerance) means when someone scolds me, he's testing my cultivation. If I don’t get angry, he's actually helping me improve. Everyone is here to help me. So, I joyfully accept each person's challenge. This is *Xi Ren*. Everyone is a teacher in my life, so who is there to be angry with? “Everyone is a good person, and everything is a good thing."  Every event is an opportunity to improve myself. If we think this way, then peace will naturally come.  Don't make things difficult for yourself; you must understand these principles clearly. Moreover, if I've done nothing wrong and am still being criticized, it’s said, “Those who are unjustly slandered will often see their descendants suddenly flourish.” Therefore, not only do you not get angry with him, but when he scolds you, you should thank him. “Thank you for sending good fortune, not only to me but also to my descendants.”

A person's fortune comes from cultivating a heart of blessings. When learning traditional culture, the first thing is to not haggle with people. Open your heart and mind; the more generous you are, the more blessings you'll receive. It’s like the Buddhist temples. As soon as you enter the main gate, the first hall you see has the Laughing Buddha in the center. What is this teaching us? To learn the teachings of the sages, we must first have a big belly – a large capacity to embrace, and a smiling face. Only then can we enter the door. “Have a heart of equality and present a joyful countenance.” Treat everyone with equal respect and love; be happy to see everyone. Fated encounters bring people together, even from thousands of miles away, so cherish every connection. If someone treats me poorly, I use *Xi Ren*, recognizing he's helping me grow. Then, I use *Ci Ren*. He's a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, yet he doesn't understand how to behave and continues to create negative karma. It’s very pitiful. I should help him. Through interacting with me, he might recognize and embrace Chinese culture.  He will then learn. Wouldn't that change that person's fate, even the fate of his entire family?

In this era, we must recognize that there aren’t many people who understand the principles of ethics and morality. Therefore, it’s common for others to make mistakes. It’s difficult to find filial sons and loyal ministers these days. But in ancient times, those who were not filial couldn’t stand among the people. This has been broken across generations, and the societal atmosphere and people's hearts are severely deteriorated. From another perspective, instead of getting angry, we should be saddened. Think of our ancestors in heaven.  They bestowed upon us five thousand years of wisdom, yet we've managed to live like this – experiencing mental and physical pain, constant family conflicts, and feeling so wronged. It’s truly regrettable. So, we should hurry and study well, leading the whole society and the entire Chinese nation to delve deeply into the teachings of our ancestors. Once we realize this point, and the reality of our times, we should have pity on those who make mistakes and not blame them, otherwise we’re the ones who don’t understand. If he hasn’t learned and you're criticizing him, isn't that harsh? Therefore, “Leave room in everything.”

Confucius said, “To kill without teaching is called cruelty.” To punish someone without teaching them is called abuse.  So, we must be tolerant towards those who haven’t learned, even our closest relatives. If a child, being immature, does something very rebellious, it's because he hasn't learned properly. And, “If a father doesn’t teach, it is his fault. If a teacher is not strict, it’s his negligence.”  If a child, only thirteen or fourteen years old, does something so defiant, that's the *result*. What is the *cause*? The cause is that we didn’t teach him properly.  As a former elementary school teacher, when I read about negative behaviors in the newspaper, I repent. If I forgot to teach my students, and they end up making such mistakes, I bear a significant responsibility.

Now, on one hand, young people haven't learned. And, even if they have learned, they can’t possibly understand deeply right away. We ourselves, in learning, will often go back and forth, fluctuating between progress and regression. Maybe today you don't lose your temper, but tomorrow you can't control it again. We're inconsistent ourselves, so how much more so will young people and children be? Their self-control is likely weaker than ours. So, others may not fully understand yet, and sometimes they will repeat mistakes. Don't be angry. It's normal to see them progress and regress. Especially in this era, not just young people, but I feel that even our generations have a tendency to hear some important principles and think, "Hmm, that's good, really?" Then, we have to fall on our faces: "Ouch! I’m bleeding!  It’s true that doing it that way leads to trouble.” Only then will they turn around. People nowadays are often slow to realize things. If you calmly observe, those who finally learn traditional culture have often already made a complete mess of their lives, hitting rock bottom, harming their bodies, and destroying their families. Only then will they say, “It's true! We can’t do it that way. Traditional culture was right.” So, when you see others knowingly doing wrong, don't be saddened; lead by example. That's most important. "When one has faults, if they are changed, one becomes like new" – don't hide your mistakes.

When our children are truly disobedient, don't speak to them in absolute terms. Leave them a way back, so that when they stumble, they still have a place to come home and have their wounds tended. And when tending to their wounds, don’t say, "See, I told you so!" He'll be crying from the pain already, and next time he won't let you help him.  If he does stumble and come home, say, “Oh, child, are you hungry? Mom will make you some noodles. You must have been working so hard and are exhausted. Go to sleep first and rest well, we can talk about it tomorrow.” Once he calms down, the feeling of "Mom is the best in the world" will arise. And then it will be easier to talk to him. Nowadays, adults also have a lot of anger, and they might say things like, “You dare! You try doing that! I’ll disown you!” Once you say something like that, even if he wants to turn around, he can't save face. If he doesn't come back, he might continue to wander outside, and it’s possible that major disaster is waiting, because there are many polluted situations outside. One wrong step can lead to eternal regret. So, don't speak in absolutes; leave room, and he'll feel his parents' warmth and that they’re always thinking of him. When he makes a mistake, he'll realize that he should have listened to his parents, and he'll quickly be able to return.

Therefore, this phrase “Leave room in everything” is a very important cultivation for family, for dealing with matters, and for interactions with others. If we can put ourselves in others' shoes in every situation, and respond with a gentle heart, we won't create major regrets and sorrows in our lives.

This is all I wanted to share with you today. Thank you, everyone!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, striving to maintain accuracy, natural flow, and cultural context, keeping in mind the tone of a lecture.

**Lecture 24: Maintaining a Humble Heart, Guarding Against the Growth of Arrogance**

Respected elders and friends, good morning! A few days ago, on October 31st, I went to Sungai Petani to share a lesson with the public called "Happiness in a Single Thought." More than two thousand people attended. What was truly precious was seeing families, some with seven or eight members, three generations coming to the class together. Three generations participating together shows that each generation values the learning and transmission of traditional culture. Several years ago, when I was in Lujiang, we often saw this scene in our green classroom – three generations sitting together on small chairs to attend the courses. I think this is the joy of family, with several generations basking in the teachings of the sages.

Moreover, having three generations together has another advantage, because education is a collaborative effort. Parents, grandparents, and maternal grandparents must align on the correct concepts for educating children. What is the correct approach? It’s based on the classics and the standards of family precepts that have been passed down for thousands and hundreds of years. It shouldn't be, "Now I'm a grandfather/grandmother, I'm the oldest in the family, so everyone has to listen to me about educating the children." That is not appropriate.

As elders, especially as we grow older, we must set an example with our own virtuous conduct. We should always use the classics to guide our family towards a righteous family ethos. After all, the older generation truly wants what's best for the children. However, wanting what’s best shouldn’t mean indulging or spoiling them. It’s necessary to apply reason. When both generations attend the lectures together, it's easier to build consensus.

Of course, if a daughter-in-law brings her mother-in-law to a lecture, when the daughter-in-law hears an important point, she shouldn’t look at her mother-in-law. People are sensitive. You shouldn’t look at her or say, "The teacher is talking about you!" That daughter-in-law would also be quite oblivious. We need to leave people room. As the previous phrase mentioned, “In all matters, leave room for maneuver.” And in this era, sometimes the mother-in-law understands education, but the daughter-in-law does not, and this situation does occur. The previous generation still has the transmission of culture, but the next generation is all about utilitarianism. Sometimes, they don't have a clear understanding of the principles of educating children. However, as long as family members can skillfully guide their loved ones to the gates of the sages, I believe that “At the beginning of man, his nature is good.” These teachings benefit them and their descendants; no one will not accept them.

I once heard a lady say, "I feel like my family can't cooperate with me at all. When I ask them to study *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child), they don't. When I ask them to let the children study *Di Zi Gui*, they refuse." So, I asked her, "Would your husband object to teaching your children about filial piety?" She said, "No." "Would your husband object to teaching your children about love and respect for their siblings?" She said, "Of course not." "Would your husband object to teaching your children to be careful in their actions and trustworthy in their words?" "No." "Would your husband object to teaching them how to love others and get along with people?" She said, "No." "Then does your husband object to your children studying *Di Zi Gui*?" "Yes!"

So, I tell everyone, no one objects to learning traditional culture and *Di Zi Gui*; they simply don't understand it. Why don't they understand? Because we haven't behaved well enough. When they see, "Those who are learning it are like this, I certainly won't learn, and I certainly won't let my children learn," then there's the problem.  "When you act but do not achieve the desired results, turn inward and examine yourself.” The problem lies with us. Those principles align with everyone's innate conscience and good nature; no one will object to them. However, most people haven't deeply studied the teachings of the sages. They'll first observe those who are learning them to see if the teachings are good or bad. This is human nature. So, at any time, you have to look back at your own heart, because the root of all problems lies in a problem with the heart.  This is why the *Great Learning* says, "Cultivate the person, and then the family will be in order." When one cultivates oneself, does good, and becomes upright, one will transform others, and the family will be in order.

Seeing how actively our fellow Malaysians are learning traditional culture makes me very moved.  And happiness is in one’s own thought, in one's mind. Happiness and auspiciousness are determined by the heart. There's a saying, "Use a mirror to see your appearance; use your heart to see your fortune." When you look in a mirror, you can clearly see your appearance and clothing. But when you look at your own heart, you can judge the good and bad fortune in your life. Whether you are happy or not depends on your own heart. Those who blame others, even if they are rich and powerful, will eventually squander their good fortune because of this mindset. A person who is poor now, yet is always mindful of the kindness of others, and tries their best to help them, and loves doing good, will have a day when they become successful.

If you truly use your heart to comprehend the verses in *Di Zi Gui* and *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts*, you can even predict your own fortune. As the previous sentence said, "In all matters, leave room for maneuver." A person who leaves no room for maneuver in their actions and words is destined to bring humiliation upon themselves. If their words are too harsh, eventually others will become angry, and of course, they will be scolded. “Use your heart to see your fortune.” There are also signs of an argument. For example, if we are already getting heated and we don't suppress it, and then someone says something we don't like, "bang" we lash out. Therefore, a truly perceptive person will, when they see themselves getting angry, immediately try to calm themselves down. Quickly, pick up *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts* and read it once, then read *Di Zi Gui*. "Forbear in speech, and anger will naturally disappear," and "Love all people in the world." When you read these, you can calm your heart. “When the heart is peaceful and harmonious, myriad blessings gather; when the will is crude and the nature is impatient,” always being restless and careless, “nothing will be accomplished.”

In fact, every verse is related to our good and bad fortune. Let's look at today, continuing with the next phrase:

**“When you are successful, you shouldn’t push it further.”**

When you are successful, you should be content, know how to advance and retreat, and should not be greedy. There's an idiom called "carried away by success." The flip side of being carried away by success is knowing when to stop, understanding how to advance and retreat, knowing when to retire gracefully once you have achieved success. From this, we can understand why success can make people lose themselves. Why do truly wise people understand how to retire after achieving success? People who don't know when to advance or retreat can easily suffer humiliation. If you are carried away by success and don’t know when to stop, it is still because there is a problem with your mindset. For example, when someone becomes successful, they will take all the credit. "This matter wouldn't have worked without me, it's all my achievement." When so many people have helped, hearing these words, they will feel wronged, and criticisms and slander will come. "How arrogant! So many people contributed effort and money, and he still pats his chest, saying it's all his work." This is being carried away by success. Therefore, we should know how to be humble and give credit to others.

Doing good is our duty. Doing good and then boasting is seeking fame and praise. It’s driven by a desire for fame and fortune. When the heart is off balance, this kind of behavior arises. If you fulfill your duty and there's no trace of it left in your mind, it's called "bestowing kindness without thought." You feel that you should do it. But, when you see many others helping, you feel joy for their contribution and are even grateful for their assistance. This is a very good state of mind.

Therefore, greed will lead to being carried away by success. Furthermore, arrogance, feeling that one is doing well, will slowly inflate. Therefore, if you don't guard your heart, disasters will come. In the corporate world, according to figures I saw several years ago, the average lifespan of small and medium-sized enterprises is 2.9 years, and the average lifespan of large enterprises is 7 to 8 years. A large corporation sustains the livelihoods of hundreds or thousands of people, so a leader needs to think: "If this business is to be stable, or else hundreds or thousands of people will have nothing to eat."

Therefore, *The Classic of Filial Piety* in the chapter on "Feudal Lords" states that a ruler of a country, what should his mindset be? It's "not arrogant when in a high position." Being in the position of a ruler, he must not be arrogant. If he is, it will be dangerous. If he is arrogant, he won't listen to advice, and making a wrong decision could bring disaster to millions of people, and he may even lose his life. "Control his desires and be measured." His lifestyle should be very measured, not extravagant. "Be full but not overflowing," Having a great deal of wealth but not losing it. Some rulers squander their money and end up impoverishing their people, and then they themselves lose their wealth.

Therefore, it's not easy to hold onto wealth and status. It requires being cautious and measured, like standing at the edge of an abyss or walking on thin ice. When one becomes wealthy, they face even more temptations. A man without money or status might face few temptations, but if he becomes a manager, earning a good income, temptations like wealth and women will appear. So, misfortune and fortune are intertwined.

As parents, we all hope our children will achieve great things in the future. But great achievements bring great tests, because temptations and trials will increase. First, we must teach our children to control their greed and eliminate arrogance. Otherwise, misfortune and fortune are intertwined. "How many have returned from the ancient battlefields?” In one's life, being able to retreat unscathed from all temptations is not easy, because the temptations of this era are much greater than those of a hundred years ago. Therefore, the foundation of virtue for people today needs to be even stronger than that of the ancients. Misfortune and fortune are intertwined. We need to understand this. We must build a solid foundation of virtue in ourselves and in our children. Otherwise, every family will have its own difficulties, and elders will constantly be putting out fires. Today this one has a problem, tomorrow that nephew has a problem.

The *Great Learning* says, "Virtue is the root, wealth is the branch.”  We must grasp the root. Talent and money are only branches. In fact, if you have talent and money but no virtue, problems will constantly arise. A talented person, with a good education, but lacking virtue will often be arrogant, causing conflicts with people, and generating a lot of trouble every day.

Earlier, we discussed the quality of enterprises. Why is the lifespan of companies so short? It's mainly because those in charge cannot resist temptation. There's a saying, "Early success is the greatest misfortune." If a young person becomes wealthy at a young age, and no one offers a calm analysis, "This is because your ancestors and elders have accumulated good deeds. 'A family that accumulates good deeds is certain to have surplus blessings.' Don't think you are so capable." Without such words of reminder from an elder, they'll easily become very conceited, feeling that they can do anything. For example, if their business is doing well, they think they can do well in other businesses, so they invest even more money in unfamiliar fields and eventually fail.

This "arrogance," becoming successful in business or becoming famous, in many situations will unconsciously inflate one's ego.  Let's think calmly: are we more humble than we were ten years ago? For example, we have studied traditional culture for so many years, are we more frugal, humble, and gentle than before? Or have we, after several years of study, become even more critical of others, and more assertive in our speech? If so, then we have taken the wrong path.

I was very fortunate. When the time was right, I went to Haikou. Ten years ago, I began sharing *Di Zi Gui* with the public. Thankfully, I had worked at a school for several years, so I had a lot of experience communicating with students and parents. When I went to Haikou, I talked to people about family education, about educating their children. At that time, no one in Haikou knew what *Di Zi Gui* was. And, I went to teach the children. After I taught the children, I communicated with their parents. And so, I gradually accumulated some experience to share with everyone.

China is so big, why did I happen to go to Haikou? It was all because my ancestors were protecting and arranging things. Then a year later, I had the opportunity to go to the coastal areas to share with the public. The public was very receptive. Why? Because the teachings of our ancestors are rooted in human nature. "At the beginning of man, his nature is good."  No one can refuse it. We have conducted so many courses, and no one has refused them, no one has come to hit me after listening. We have encountered many touching scenes, and they are all educating us.  A person in their seventies said, "I am in my seventies, and I am just beginning to be a student.” It's so touching to see that attitude of learning.  There were also big men in their forties and fifties who were crying loudly, "I was wrong!" Some in their forties were jumping around after hearing the lesson, saying, "Great! Great!"  Like children, people still have a pure heart. Why do they have those bad behaviors? They've been tainted. "If not taught, nature will change." But their original goodness is still there. As long as they learn, they can remove the bad habits and gradually return to their true nature.

As I shared with the public, their praise was also intense. There is a saying, "The eight winds cannot move." And we move even without the wind! Some people easily get excited, "You are truly a sage!" This kind of excessive praise. The first time I heard it, I would tremble, feeling extremely apprehensive. After hearing it five, six, or seven or eight times, you start to feel good. So, people are unconsciously selling themselves out, being held back by themselves. You have to be careful! I was very fortunate. The elders around me were especially wise. It's not because we are truly virtuous, but because we have the protection of these elders and teachers.

Once, when my grandmother passed away, many people came to our house to offer their condolences. Some elders in their seventies, when they came to our house for the first time, would say to my father, "Your son is so (this, that, etc.)..." They would start to praise me. Before they could say two sentences, my father immediately stopped the elders’ praise. "My son is so young. His virtue is far from being sufficient. Don't praise him, tell him about his faults.” I was standing nearby at the time and was very moved. Even now, when I talk about it, my eyes get a little wet. My father truly loved and protected me. When faced with praise, he felt apprehensive, and he was very protective of his son. How could someone so young withstand such praise? I remember when I went to share my insights in Tainan, my father drove me there, dropped me off, and then quickly drove away. He was afraid of inconveniencing others and afraid of being praised. So, he drove away quickly.

So, in those crucial situations, my father reminded me to stay calm. I remember after I finished sharing in Hong Kong, I became more well-known. As the saying goes, "People fear fame as pigs fear fattening." After becoming famous, going anywhere, even on trains, I couldn't relax because people would often ask, "Aren't you that...?" I would say, "You've mistaken me." At that time, in every move, I had to be very proper. I couldn’t bring shame to traditional culture.

At that time, I had a bit of a reputation in Taiwan. It was right after I had become famous, that I met Uncle Lu for the first time. I had known Uncle Lu for two years before I became famous. He was very fond of me. Truly, there are affinities between people. Walking with this elder felt like being with my own father. It truly felt that way. I remember walking with him in a park in Australia. I thought to myself, "He is truly like my father." He turned and said to me, "You are very much like my son." Later, I had the opportunity to go to mainland China and became famous. The first time I met Uncle Lu was in Maokong in Taipei. I remember it very clearly. He saw me from afar, "Oh, you're very popular, you’re a hot commodity." I have a deep impression of this, why? After not seeing him for so long, I was very excited to see this dear elder. Seeing him from far away brought me great joy. But then, he gave me a reality check, to make sure I would not forget myself and be vigilant.

After becoming famous, it's important to know your own true worth.  It’s just a matter of timing, and not because you truly have such great abilities. It’s because of the good teachings of the sages and ancestors. After speaking on stage, compare it to what you have accomplished yourself, then go to work and make changes.  These reminders are very important.  You have to constantly spur yourself on. Otherwise, when facing so much wealth, beauty, fame, and profit, you can easily be carried away by success.

Therefore, the ancients were compassionate. In the Thirteen Classics, the first chapter of *The Book of Rites*, "Quli," says, "Arrogance should not be increased; desires should not be indulged; ambition should not be fully satisfied; pleasure should not be pursued to excess." When a person is successful, their arrogance grows. For example, after earning some money, they speak loudly to their parents. After reading some books, they look down on their parents.

I remember when I first went to the mainland, the first week I went to Qufu, Shandong, to worship Confucius. Because we wanted to promote traditional culture, we went to pay our respects to Confucius and ask him to protect us. We happened to meet a very kind elder, with a face like the smiling Maitreya Bodhisattva. We ate with him. He ate vegetarian food, and the people next to him ate meat. He was not bothered by it at all. He said, “They eat meat and their mouths are full of fragrant food; I eat vegetables and face the Western Paradise." Then he shared that, since he had become older, he had many disciples, saying, "Before they went to college, they called me so lovingly, 'Master, Master.' But after studying at college for several years, when they returned, they don’t even call me 'Master' anymore.”

So, when people gain some knowledge, after being successful, “arrogance” will arise, and people change. They cannot have real learning. Why? If you have gained real learning, you should be even more grateful and repay the kindness of others. If a master has cultivated you for so many years, and you have gained real knowledge, why wouldn’t you call your master even more affectionately? If your current wisdom and abilities surpass that of your master, then you should help your master more. How can you have such a reaction? That attitude doesn’t correspond to the classics at all. Therefore, when a person's external conditions increase, if they don’t think about how much they owe to the help of others, if they start to feel they are amazing, then “arrogance” will grow.

"Desires should not be indulged." Desires are a deep abyss and must be controlled. When you enjoy pleasures and become very happy, you will sink deeper and deeper. Therefore, pleasure should not be pursued to excess. Extreme happiness will result in sadness. Bad habits and desires must be cut off immediately. The average desires in life should be met with contentment. You must not indulge them. Indulging them is bad for yourself and for future generations. For example, why are there so many modern diseases? Because everyone loves enjoying fine foods, and when pleasure is taken to an extreme, it will result in sadness. When you suffer from modern diseases, they might stay with you for many years or even decades.  Illness enters through the mouth. "The diseases of old age are the result of the health abuses of youth, and the sins of old age are the result of the wrongdoing in one's prime." Diseases in old age are the roots of illnesses from when one’s body was healthy and strong.  The sins in old age come from the bad causes one planted when they were in power and had all their energy. When you’re in power and boast and show off, when you lose your position, people will seek revenge. So, when you understand this, you won't do foolish things. Therefore, desires should not be indulged. The proper needs of life require moderation, and incorrect desires should be cut off. Bad habits and desires only cause parents to constantly worry. Gambling, drinking alcohol, these are all bad.

Furthermore, “ambition should not be fully satisfied.” You must not be overly pleased with yourself. You must be able to be happy without becoming arrogant. When cultivating a child's psychological well-being, they first need to be self-aware, to assess their own abilities, and not overreach. Second, they must be humble, content, give credit to others, and be grateful for the kindness of others. “This is due to so and so's kindness, the credit goes to them, not me.” That way, arrogance and a conceited self-satisfaction will not grow. It's all the work of the heart.

Many of the decorations in our ancestral homes have educational significance. For example, in most ancient buildings and houses, on both sides of the hall, they would place vases and mirrors. When you enter the house, you must be "calm," and you shouldn’t bring your unhappiness from outside into the house. Many parents don't understand this principle. When they come home, they throw their tantrums. In the end, children are often very afraid and their psychological state becomes unstable. This is not healthy for a child's physical and mental development.

The women of the previous generation truly had virtue. I've met many classmates' mothers, including my own mother, I have never seen my mother lose her temper, nor have I ever seen her scold anyone. Often, in such a cultivated atmosphere, your heart will slowly become calm, and you will not be restless. If a mother is very impatient and volatile, speaking like thunder, how can a child be calm?  So, in ancient times, they used decorations to remind everyone.

A common decoration found in families is the "ruyi" (scepter). In Taoist temples, you also often see the three gods of happiness, prosperity, and longevity, and the God of Prosperity holds a "ruyi". It reminds us to "turn back and have ‘as you wish’.” Its shape is bent back. What does that bend remind us? It means knowing when to stop. When you are successful, you must return early. "When you are successful, you shouldn’t push it further." Turning back will bring you "as you wish." This “turning back” means reflecting on yourself, calming yourself down, and being self-aware. That way, you won't allow arrogance to grow, your desires to be indulged, your ambition to be fully satisfied, or your pleasure to be excessive. You won't commit these mistakes.

There are also many idioms, such as "When the moon is full, it wanes." Nature is teaching us. It's not just the decorations in the home that teach us. Nature is also showing us: when the moon is full, it’s like a person who is not humble. When wealth and status are at their peak, when arrogance grows, decline begins. "When water is full, it overflows." When water is full, it spills over. There's also the saying, "Wealth doesn’t last three generations."  But, now it’s “wealth doesn't last ten years.” Why is the time of wealth and status becoming shorter and shorter? It's because the foundation of people's virtue is becoming more and more unstable.

The Duke of Zhou was a sage, and Confucius used the Duke of Zhou as an analogy to warn people against arrogance. The analogy has reached its pinnacle because the Duke of Zhou was whom Confucius admired the most. Confucius said, "If one has the talent and beauty of the Duke of Zhou, but is arrogant and stingy, then there is nothing else worth noting."


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a natural tone:

**Translation:**

"Even if a person possesses the talent and capabilities of the Duke of Zhou, if they are arrogant and miserly, unwilling to share with others, they are destined to achieve nothing.

Everyone must understand that the more a person shares their wealth and helps others, the more wealth they will gain. Giving in the form of material wealth brings wealth, while miserliness prevents wealth from arriving. Why is this? Money, like water, needs to flow. It's a currency, a circulating medium. If money stagnates, hoarding it goes against the Way, undermining one’s own benevolence. It shows a lack of compassion when one doesn’t help those in need, and one’s conscience becomes increasingly depraved. Therefore, one must practice giving. The more one gives, the more seeds of future prosperity are sown. Many families enjoy generations of wealth because they have a tradition of generosity and charitable giving. Similarly, if one understands many principles and has a wealth of experience but doesn't share it with others, their wisdom will diminish and they will become foolish. If one frequently shares good principles and experiences, then this giving of knowledge will bring intelligence and wisdom. Therefore, arrogance creates a bottleneck for one's learning and abilities, demonstrating how detrimental arrogance truly is. An arrogant person will find themselves losing the support of others wherever they go. Their arrogance may even lead them to suppress or belittle others, thus creating chaos. Because the time of heaven is not as important as the advantages of the earth, and the advantages of the earth are not as important as the harmony of people. An arrogant person will inevitably disrupt the harmony of others.

Therefore, everyone must know how to employ people wisely. A good character is more valuable than outstanding talent. A person with a good character will be affirming and appreciative of others. As a result, everyone will get along and cooperate smoothly with them. However, those who are intolerant and look down on others, no matter how talented they are, will only create chaos and unrest. But people today are shortsighted; they only look at what’s in front of them. "This person's abilities and experience are most important to my company right now." As a result, after three months, they're in trouble, things are a mess. One cannot be shortsighted. One must have a long-term vision, especially when employing executives because their influence has a wide reach.

Xunzi said, "The success of all things lies in respect; their failure in negligence." If a matter is to be achieved, it must be because the person in charge is respectful in their approach and their treatment of others. Yet why do those who once succeeded later fail? It is because, over time, they are unable to maintain that respect, they become arrogant, and signs of failure begin to appear. Truly discerning individuals can see the signs of good or ill fortune in a person's eyes and attitude. There are countless examples of this throughout history. We don't have to wait for others to judge us; we can examine ourselves. Every day when we look in the mirror, do we see kind and benevolent eyes? Do we have the capacity to embrace and forgive? This is an important reminder from Confucius to his contemporaries and future generations: never be arrogant.

There's a passage in *Zizhi Tongjian* (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Governance) that has always resonated with me: "The greater one’s virtue, the more humble one’s heart; the broader one’s achievements, the more modest one’s attitude; although one might be free from worry in the present, one still regards oneself as someone deserving of Heaven’s wrath and people's resentment.” The greater one's virtue, the more one humbles oneself; the greater one’s success, the more humble one's attitude; even if one is at peace now, without any worries, one should still see oneself as though one is worthy of Heaven's anger and people's disdain.

It is very easy for someone in a position of power to become conceited and lose their perspective. How then do we remind ourselves? For example, the emperor is the Son of Heaven, the leader of the entire nation. No one is higher than him. Is it easy for him to become arrogant? Very easy. "What I say goes.” But the sage-kings of the past were often aware of the danger, recognizing that "I am the Son of Heaven, but who oversees me? Heaven oversees me." In relation to Heaven, they were also subjects, the sons of Heaven. They had to act on behalf of Heaven, taking care of their people, and implementing heavenly principles. If they deviated from the Way of Heaven, Heaven would be angered. So, in the past, wise emperors, upon seeing a natural disaster, would think, "Heaven is punishing me, I must repent, I must go to the Temple of Heaven and reflect upon myself." They understood “Heaven's wrath and people’s resentment.” The people are like water; they can support a boat, but they can also capsize it. They were always on guard and dared not indulge their habits.

“When one has achieved success, it is not appropriate to move further ahead” This is a very important principle of character that we must teach our children. Upon seeing this point, Mr. Liao Fan, in his four-chapter *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, made “The Effect of Humility” the major theme of one chapter. The first chapter deals with understanding the nature of fate, "The Study of Establishing Destiny"; the second with methods for correcting faults, "The Method of Correcting Faults"; the third with "Ways to Accumulate Good Deeds"; and the fourth with "The Effect of Humility".

Of so many virtues, why did *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* only highlight humility? It is because humility prevents one from becoming conceited, and it is humility that preserves wealth and prosperity. In the *I Ching*, there are 64 hexagrams. 63 of them are a mix of good and bad fortune, only one hexagram is completely auspicious in all its six lines, and that is the hexagram of "Humility." If one is humble, one can turn any misfortune into good fortune. If one is fortunate, one can maintain that good fortune.

In fact, in "The Study of Establishing Destiny," Mr. Liao Fan had already used “humility” to remind his child. He said, "Even if fate decrees that you will be honored, always think of being in a state of decline; even if all goes well, always anticipate adversity; even if you have enough to eat, always think of being impoverished; even if people love and respect you, always feel a sense of fear; even if your family has high status, always think of yourself as insignificant; even if your learning is considerable, always think of yourself as ignorant.” People refine their character in all kinds of situations.

It's easiest for people to fall when things are going well. When good fortune and wealth come, people start to indulge themselves, start to take things for granted, and that leads to their downfall. “Prosperity eliminates people, adversity refines people.” In adversity, one must have an open mind, see the bigger picture, and not dwell on petty issues. In prosperity, one must rein themselves in. Otherwise, things get easier and easier, and they begin to lose perspective. The verses we just read address times of success. “When fate decrees that you will be honored,” when prosperity comes, then “always think of being in a state of decline.” Think of being secure while anticipating danger. “Now I am prosperous, but if there were a change, could I still survive?” Many people are very wealthy, but then their business fails, and they are unable to live in poverty. Some even commit suicide. Far-sighted parents, even when wealthy, still have their children live frugally.

There was a chancellor in the Song Dynasty whose house wasn't large. Someone asked him, “You’re a chancellor, why is your house so small?” He replied, “I may be a chancellor, but my children may not be. If they get used to this high standard of living now, then my children's wealth may be lower than mine in the future, am I not harming them by setting this standard?" This father had wisdom. “Hiding wealth to educate his children.” Don't let children know the family’s financial situation. Often consider how the ancients taught their children and how they dealt with people. You’ll expand your mind and broaden your vision. Therefore, reading history will give you more experience and insight.

“Even if all goes well, always anticipate adversity,” so that you won’t become arrogant. Although things are going smoothly now, you must keep a good mindset. You cannot be casual or disrespectful towards others, so that you don't unintentionally offend or antagonize them. Maintain vigilance and caution.

“Even if you have enough to eat, always think of being impoverished.” Think to yourself: "It's not always a given that I will be able to enjoy such a good life, it's better to be frugal." Even with countless riches, one still eats just three meals a day. Our daily consumption is limited. We should use the money we save to help those in need, and in doing so, our virtue will increase. Moreover, “frugality nurtures integrity.” If our material desires increase unchecked, it will be very dangerous. The more we spend, the higher our greed becomes. Will we then steal public funds or unjust wealth? It’s very likely, so frugality cultivates integrity.

"Even if people love and respect you, always feel a sense of fear.” When people love and respect us, we must be filled with trepidation. Firstly, we must be grateful that we are benefiting from the virtue of our ancestors and parents, and not take it for granted. When people love and respect us, we must be mindful of their kindness, which should cause us to feel fear. Furthermore, in general, we know our faults and impure thoughts and intentions, but others may not. But because others have a good connection with us, they love, respect, and praise us, we should feel apprehensive. "I don't have such high virtue, yet they still love and respect me, I must not betray their cultivation of me." We must be cautious and not disappoint them. In this way, we repay the love and respect they have given to us by "feeling fear." Otherwise, those who love us most will often see us failing to uphold our virtue and committing significant errors, which will lead to life-long regrets for both ourselves and them.

“Even if your family has high status, always think of yourself as insignificant.” Although one’s family may be prominent, one must not be boastful, one must be humble. “Even if your learning is considerable, always think of yourself as ignorant." Otherwise one will become arrogant and proud. One must truly think of oneself as ignorant. Why? Because there are always people greater than ourselves, and there is always something beyond our comprehension. If we compare ourselves to Confucius, Mencius, and the 72 Sages, we are far behind, so what is there to be arrogant about?

We must not only be humble and introspective, but also, as Mr. Liao Fan urged his child, "think of enhancing the virtues of your ancestors, and making up for the faults of your parents." Instead of becoming conceited and indulging our desires, we must always carry the burden of our responsibilities. People with a sense of responsibility are more cautious and careful in their actions, daring not to cause trouble or bring dishonor to their families or organizations. "Think of enhancing the virtues of your ancestors, and making up for the faults of your parents; above, think of repaying the nation’s kindness, below, think of creating blessings for the family; outwardly, think of helping those in distress, inwardly, think of curbing your evil." These are all important reminders for children. Inwardly, curb your desires and evil thoughts, outwardly, help those in distress, above, think of repaying the nation's kindness, below, think of creating blessings for the family. Always remember these acts of kindness.

Remembering kindness is very important. Remember kindness, forget resentment. This is a very important family teaching. Mr. Liao Fan constantly reminded his children to remember these kindnesses. *Disciple’s Rules* says, “Kindness should be repaid, resentment should be forgotten.” In fact, happiness often lies in a single thought. Those who feel unhappy now, will become happy as long as this statement enters their heart. "Kindness should be repaid.” If your heart is filled with the kindness of your parents, the nation, teachers, and all kinds of people, you’ll be very happy, thinking, "How lucky I am! They love me so much. I cannot disappoint them." “Be sure to provide what your parents like.” “Establish yourself, follow the Way, and make a name for yourself, so that you can bring glory to your parents.” You’ll then have the motivation. Know kindness, be grateful, and repay kindness. Resentment will be forgotten, and you’ll no longer feel suffering. But people today are the opposite. They forget kindness and remember all resentments, even trivial matters. They often bring up old grievances, forgetting kindness and remembering resentment.

I remember a colleague’s child. We were just talking to him and he was still quite young. I asked him, "Do you ever feel down?" He replied, "Yes, I get upset about little things." I feel that he used the phrase very well, "little trivial things." People get upset over such minor things. Their hearts become narrower and narrower, intolerant of others. If you expand your heart, what is there to argue about? And truly, people don’t love themselves. They cause trouble for themselves. Forgiving others is liberating oneself and giving oneself a chance. If you don’t forgive others, you’ll be in anguish and pain even in your dreams. Are you not tormenting yourself? Forgiving others is treating oneself with kindness, giving oneself a chance to cultivate virtue, and also giving oneself blessings. Forgiving others, opening your heart, will lead to blessings. Not forgiving others, is a high-risk factor for cancer. If you feel unhappy every day, the water crystals in your body will look ugly, and your cells will easily become diseased.

Furthermore, where do people often lack composure? When they constantly complain and cultivate resentment, not only do they cause themselves suffering, but they also relentlessly tell the next generation of the past generation’s grievances. Aren’t they harming their children? For example, if their son-in-law is useless, and the child is brought up by the grandmother, the grandmother would say, “Your father is really...” criticizing him harshly, causing the child to develop a hatred towards his father. Is this grandmother wise? A person who hates their father is destined to be unhappy in this life. Without their father, how would they exist? No matter how wrong the father is, he still has his positive aspects. One must affirm him. One must let their child be tolerant of the father’s faults. Therefore, the grievances of the previous generation must not be passed on to the next. One must be wise and calm. If you control your emotions, you can control your and your children’s future.

If people owe you, Heaven will repay you. If this son-in-law is not good, or the husband is not good, still respect him. If you treat him with courtesy, your child will develop a very high level of virtue, because they will admire their mother’s cultivation. “My mother is so tolerant, I must achieve success quickly, so that my mother can enjoy comfort and happiness.” I have met such classmates. His father was unfair to his mother, but his mother did not complain. She raised them through hardship. It’s impossible for a person to have a perfect life. The game itself might be difficult to play, but as long as they make every move with empathy and integrity, that is the wisdom of playing the game, a manifestation of great self-cultivation. This kind of life will see a reversal of fortune.

Next, let us look at the next statement. Each of these sentences allows one to "examine one's own heart to foresee good or ill":

[When others have joyous occasions, do not feel jealous. When others encounter misfortune, do not feel happy.]

If someone experiences a disaster, and we rejoice in their misfortune, we are sure to encounter misfortune ourselves. These statements are related to the good and bad fortune of individuals and their families. What constitutes joyous occasions? For example, an individual might have handsome features, good morals, knowledge, achievement, and a good education. If someone's son graduates with a master's degree, and they celebrate it, if you think to yourself, “What's so great about that? Many people with master's degrees are unemployed!", and don’t give them your blessing, but rather curse them, then that's not good. If someone's family is very harmonious, and you see it and feel jealous, then that’s also not good. If someone has a skill or talent, we must offer our blessing, and rejoice along with them. “When we see people doing good, we should think to emulate them.”

How do we overcome jealousy? When jealousy arises in our hearts, when we feel envious, then we should observe our hearts. This state of mind is not correct. How can we change it? For the person whom you are most jealous of, go find them tomorrow and tell them what you admire most about them. Tell them their merits. I guarantee that you'll get goosebumps. You'll feel very unnatural, and the words will be forced. When a person corrects a bad habit, it doesn’t happen just once or twice, there is a process. But the more difficult it is, the more you should say it. “At first, it will be forced, but in the end, you will feel at ease.” This is a statement from *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. At the start, you won't be able to relax or be natural, but after two or three times, that jealousy will really transform into admiration of others. You have to make the effort to do it. “When praising others, you are doing good; if others are aware of it, you should be even more diligent.”

Let me share a story with you so you can understand just how powerful jealousy can be. There was a high official named Jiang Yuan during the Song Dynasty. He had ten sons. One was a hunchback, one had a limp, one had withered limbs, one was crippled, one was mad, one was an imbecile, one was deaf, one was blind, one was mute, and one died in prison. Tragic, right? Nine of his sons were ill, and one died. Gongming Zigao saw this situation and, being compassionate, asked, "Sir, you hold such a high office, how do you usually act towards others, that you have such retribution and misfortune?" Jiang Yuan said, "No, I have not done anything wrong. It's just that I like to be jealous. When I see someone better than me, I am jealous of them, and I hate them. If someone flatters me, I am very happy. When I hear of someone's good deeds, I suspect it is fake. That it is a performance. When I hear of someone's misdeeds, I'll say that it must be true. When I see someone gain something, it's as if I have lost something myself. When I see someone lose something, I'm very happy.” Therefore, a person’s wrong thoughts can diminish their blessings and create misfortune. His thinking was upside down. “I was only thinking these things, I did not commit any bad acts.” It all comes down to intentions. So, a single wrong thought can lead to evil deeds. Gongming Zigao then sighed and said, “Sir, with this kind of attitude, you are going to bring annihilation upon your whole family! Yet you say it doesn't matter? You are not alert to the danger at all! Your retribution will not stop there.”

When Jiang Yuan heard this, he was terrified. Zigao was very wise, compassionate, and skilled at guiding others. Seeing that Jiang Yuan was terrified, he encouraged him, “Although Heaven is high and distant, it sees everything with clarity, if you do any good deed, Heaven will see it. If you can repent and change your ways, you will certainly be able to transform misfortune into blessing. It's not too late to correct yourself now.” As a result, Jiang Yuan became vigilant, completely corrected his faults, and got rid of all of his old habits. In just a few years, all nine of his son’s illnesses were cured. This is all recorded in history. That will be all for today. Thank you, everyone!"

**Lecture 25: Envy, Jealousy, and Hatred Lead to Hell; Emulating Learning Leads to Heaven**

Respected elders and friends, greetings! The core teaching of our Chinese nation's 5,000-year-old sages and ancestors is the single word "love." They taught us how to love ourselves, love our parents, love our families, and to extend that love, "Love all people." Mencius further said, "Be loving to your kin, and extend that to the people," "Being loving to your kin" means loving one's own parents and family, and extending that to love all people. Because everyone is born of parents, we know that when we are hurt, our parents are most distressed. "Do not do to others what you do not wish to be done to you." Therefore, we shouldn't hurt others because their parents would also be distressed. So, from loving our own family, we learn to love all people. “Being loving to your kin and then loving all people, and loving all people and then loving all things." Not only should we love people, but all living creatures also have their place in relationships, they have parents and offspring.

There's a story recorded that a butcher was about to slaughter a mother cow. Perhaps, like human mothers and children, the calf and mother were connected. The calf took the butcher's knife and hid it, but the owner found it. Seeing the owner was determined to kill its mother, the calf finally swallowed the knife itself. To save its mother, the calf didn't even care for its own life. The butcher was deeply moved and did not kill the mother cow. This is why Mencius said, “Love the people and then love all things.” Protect all living creatures, because they also feel pain, and they also have parents and loved ones. This is why we must nurture kindness in children from a young age, this is their innate nature.

A four-year-old girl was given a large, live fish by a neighbor. Because the basin was too small, the fish's tail stuck out, and her grandfather immediately cut it off with a knife, making blood flow. The four-year-old girl immediately cried, "It hurts! It hurts!" Did anyone teach her that fish feel pain? Not necessarily, but she immediately felt it. Our ancestors were deeply insightful about human nature, guiding us to keep our inherent nature throughout our lives, to maintain the filial piety of parent-child love, and then to extend it to love all people and all living things.

The origin of love is filial piety. If filial piety isn't taught, then it cannot be called education. Confucius said, "Filial piety is the root of virtue." Filial piety is the very foundation of virtuous conduct and love, "From which education arises," education should begin here. We know our ancestors taught "love," they taught love for others, but what else? They also taught love for oneself. If we don't even love ourselves and are always destroying ourselves, how can we truly love others? With what attitude in life can we love? If we ourselves have a lot of bad habits, like drinking to the point of damaging our liver, how can we love our children? Therefore, "Those who wish to love others must first love themselves; those who wish to save others must first save themselves." Now, if we want to love our children, to nurture their success, to save our children, where should we begin? With loving ourselves, with correcting our own bad habits. If we don't correct our bad habits, we will be giving our children negative influences every day.

One day, a four-year-old girl's father took her to a friend's house. As soon as the door opened, this four-year-old child went in first, jumped on their sofa, and started to take off her socks, a very practiced movement. She then placed the socks on the sofa. Her father was dumbfounded, because the action was too familiar. Her father did this every day when he got home. As a result, his own daughter did the same at someone else’s house.

We have discussed the character "教" (jiào, to teach) many times. Our ancestors, when they created this character, encapsulated the wisdom of life within it. The seal script of "教" shows a principle of influence from the top down on the left side, demonstrating teaching by example. The right side is a hand holding a branch, indicating patient and tireless instruction, repeatedly emphasizing the points. This is teaching. When we look at how the character "怒" (nù, anger) is written, it has “slave” on top and “heart” below. When a person loses their temper, they become a slave to bad habits, dragged around by them, no longer in control. Isn't that a slave? These characters our ancestors created remind us how to conduct ourselves, reminding us to love ourselves first, so we can love others.

"When superiors like something, inferiors will do it even more." Whatever parents and elders like, the next generation will be even more extreme, they will be even better. Fan Gong did good deeds, and in the end, all his four children followed his example. However, if it is a bad habit, it might become even worse as it's passed down. That is why "wealth doesn't last three generations.” If the values of diligence and thrift aren't passed down, the next generation will be even more extravagant, and that is how the family will be destroyed.

Let's review the saying from our last lecture: "Use a mirror to see your appearance." We look at our faces to see if they are dirty, or if our hair is falling out, and we should tidy our appearance. Do you all tidy your appearance before going out? Otherwise, if you go to a banquet with a crucial button undone, won't people laugh at you? We should be dignified and cautious. If you are often this cautious, your magnetic field and aura will definitely be different. People will feel that you are well-behaved and will respect you. If your clothes are often unbuttoned, revealing something, or wrinkled and messy, people will start laughing at you even before you walk over. If you don't respect yourself, you will naturally attract disrespect from others. If you respect yourself, others will respect you. If you abandon yourself, how can others help you?

Therefore, life is in our own hands. "Use a mirror to see your appearance, and use your heart to see good or bad fortune." All blessings and fields of merit are inseparable from our own minds. All good and bad fortune are inseparable from our heart. When a person clearly understands: Are my thoughts good or bad, beneficial or detrimental? Then they will love themselves. They won't even dare to have evil thoughts. If they pass this life attitude to their children, and their children have deep roots in this from an early age, and they don't even have bad thoughts, they will definitely achieve greatness.

Each line in the *Zhu Family Maxims* teaches us self-love. If we pass on these teachings, they become the family way. It's loving our future descendants. Therefore, every sentence is a good family rule. Last time we discussed:

【When others have good fortune, do not feel envious or jealous.】

I ask everyone, when people see others' good fortune, and they harbor envy and jealousy, their hearts and conscience will deteriorate. Is this self-love? There's a saying: “One thought that incurs the wrath of the gods; one word that injures the harmony of heaven and earth; one action that brings disaster upon descendants.” We must be extremely cautious. We should consider: why should we not be envious when others have good fortune? Think about it, if we experience something wonderful, achieve wealth and status, get a good job, or have a healthy son, which are all very happy events in life, and then others criticize and are jealous, how would we feel? It wouldn't be good. Therefore, when we see such a situation, we generally find it terrible. Why should we be jealous when people have good fortune, and even try to ruin it? Isn't that inviting people's anger?

"The anger of heaven and the resentment of men." People will get angry, and heaven will also severely condemn such behavior. It completely goes against kindness. When we see something good, we should help others accomplish it. “Speak of others' good deeds, and that is good; When people know it, they will strive to do better.” If more people follow his example after hearing you speak, isn't that wonderful? Guan Gong (Lord Guan) said, "May heaven always produce good people, may people always do good deeds, and may mouths always speak good words." This is in alignment with the will of heaven and the people, speaking good words to create a positive atmosphere in society. Everyone should understand, do our thoughts and words have an impact? They do! Are they first pulling ourselves down or lifting us up? When others have good fortune, blessing them and praising them, your virtue will increase. But if you are jealous and slander, your virtue will decline, and you will bring misfortune upon yourself. We will discuss historical examples of envy and framing later, which are very tragic, examples of heaven's anger and people’s resentment. Don’t underestimate a thought, a word. Their magnetic field is very strong.

“One word that injures the harmony of heaven and earth.” We should follow the "Great Harmony Qi" of heaven and earth. We should always think about the big picture, about the whole family. Don't be jealous or make sarcastic remarks. Do not deny and criticize others when they have done good deeds. This is not good. To say, “He isn't really doing good. He probably used underhanded methods to do it,” will cause people who were originally happy to follow the example to start doubting the act of doing good. It will not only corrupt your own heart, but also corrupt other people's hearts. Everyone should calmly consider, what is our first thought when we see someone do good? If it is doubt, then we are also affected by negative influences. People should be calm. Learn the good, and don't learn the bad. I ask you all, do we learn more good or bad things from TV dramas?

There seems to be a line that says "admire, envy, and hate." Admiration chemically changes to envy, and then envy becomes hatred for others. When people see others living long lives, they're unhappy. When they see others have a harmonious marriage, they are unhappy. Why are people's thoughts all wrong? It is because they don't understand the principles. It is pitiful when a person doesn't understand the principles. Every day they are diminishing their own blessings with wrong thinking, and they're misleading their children and people around them.

I once saw a mother riding a motorcycle with a fourth-grade child. The child was sitting behind the mother, and the mother's face looked like someone owed her a lot of money. I was standing at the school gate picking up my child and was a bit startled when I saw her face. However, I didn't let her affect me. If people don't smile at us, we will smile at them. If people don't try to be peaceful with us, we will try to be peaceful with them. If people are not friendly to us, we will be friendly to them, and we will slowly change things. I smiled at this mother for many days, not just smiling, but when she stopped her motorcycle, I would pick up her son's backpack from the basket, put it on his back, and pat his head. After a few days, she became happy. The next time she saw me, she smiled at me first.

I saw his mother first, then I saw her son. They were from the same company, and they were exactly the same, both with sour faces. Wrong thinking can also unconsciously affect children. Therefore, our thoughts, words, and actions should all be cautious. Cautiousness is the foundation for preserving the family. Can we maintain good family values? We need to put a great deal of effort into it.

When people understand the principles, if they see good fortune today, good moral character, good learning, a good family, or good ability, this is the result. What is the cause? They cultivated it themselves, so what is there to be jealous of? When people have such good results, it should inspire us to learn from them. So “admire, learn, and emulate,” and you too will become a sage. Isn't it so? "When you see someone good, think of becoming like them." We should truly put this sentence in our hearts. I ask everyone, how many people did we meet today? Were there thirty people? If we learn the good points from thirty people, that's extraordinary! How much will we have grown today? Therefore, whether your attitude is right or wrong, it makes a world of difference. When we write books or make advertisements about this idea, we should also add, "Envy, jealousy, and hatred lead to hell." If everyone treats this as a casual saying, and it becomes normal, that's the end of it, the next generation will be ruined. We should instead “admire, learn, and emulate” and become sages, because “Sages and worthies can be achieved through cultivation.” This is why the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* is so important, and it leads “to heaven.”

Therefore, the difference in one thought is so great, understanding the principles is essential. People gained their results through hard work. There is no free lunch in the world. "A family that accumulates good deeds is bound to have abundant blessings.” There is always a cause. Therefore, when people understand the principles, their hearts are peaceful. They often “seek methods for success.” They recognize the good causes others have cultivated, and they quickly try to follow and put in the effort. "Destiny is created by myself, blessings are sought by myself."

When people experience good fortune, it is because they have cultivated it. We absolutely should not be jealous. What if we are? Last time we talked about the example of Jiang Yuan, who didn’t think having a jealous thought was a big deal. As a result, ten of his sons became sick, and one died in prison, while the other nine suffered from severe illness. Later, he became close to virtuous people (which is why "be close to the benevolent" in the *Standards* is so important), and he completely corrected his wrongdoings. In the end, all nine of his sickly sons recovered. From this story we understand that it's never too late to correct your mistakes, but we cannot procrastinate. If you wait until tomorrow, perhaps a disaster will strike today, and you won’t have the chance tomorrow. You have to bravely correct your mistakes.

As we just mentioned, “One action that brings disaster upon descendants,” we must not do it. Being jealous of others brings disaster upon descendants. Han Fei was a very virtuous and learned man. His elder classmate, Li Si, who was the prime minister of the Qin state, was jealous of his younger classmate, Han Fei, and plotted to kill him. Continuing to develop jealousy is terrifying; it can cause people to hurt others. Have you heard of the palace women of past emperors being jealous of each other? When an opportunity came, their jealousy would become terrible. They would cut off people's hands and gouge out their eyes. There's a saying, "The most venomous thing is a woman's heart.” This is not written in the classics, but it’s commonly said, meaning that when a woman's motherly love is unleashed, she can nurture many sages. The three Mothers of the Zhou Dynasty were great examples. They cultivated many talented individuals for the nation. If a woman develops in the direction of great compassion and kindness, that’s amazing; but if she doesn’t, and her heart gradually becomes small and jealous, she can become very ruthless.

*The Book of Liao Fan* tells us that if we want to improve our virtue and knowledge, we must overcome the most difficult of our bad habits. Confucius said, “Start with the most difficult." Which is most difficult? Jealousy. When a person's heart is not open, they will definitely be jealous of others. When our heart is vast, our blessings will be vast. Therefore, we must let go of jealousy. The method to overcome it is that when you see the person that you're the most jealous of, go praise him, speak of his good. Although your whole body will feel like you have goosebumps because you are not used to praising others, and it will be painful and your head might feel like it's going to explode. But after two or three times, you will have broken through the habit and won’t be controlled by it. "Begin by forcing yourself, and in the end, you will be comfortable."

We can gain insights about life from history, and we won't be shortsighted. We won't follow our bad habits. Because history is like a mirror. Li Si, who was jealous and harmed his fellow student Han Fei, not only corrupted his own nature, but also caused a very serious problem. A virtuous person can benefit millions of people, and by killing them, isn't one destroying the well-being of millions of people? Our ancestors told us, “Promote the virtuous and receive the greatest rewards; hide the virtuous and suffer obvious punishment.” Everything is decided by one thought, and there is a huge difference between good fortune and disaster. If you recommend virtuous people to the nation or organization, you will receive the greatest rewards, because such people will definitely benefit the people and the group.

During the Spring and Autumn period, Bao Shuya recommended Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong became a good prime minister. "He united the lords many times and restored order to the nation." Not only did the state of Qi benefit, but the entire Chinese nation was united. Otherwise, perhaps we would not be of Han Chinese descent today. Confucius said that we might be "wearing our hair loose and wearing our clothes reversed like the barbarians," and we would have been wiped out. Therefore, Guan Zhong's contribution was significant. However, there was someone whose contribution was even greater, Bao Shuya, because he was the one who recommended Guan Zhong. Bao Shuya's descendants were all high officials for more than ten generations. "A family that accumulates good deeds is bound to have abundant blessings." *The Book of Liao Fan* tells us, "Observe the families who are loyal and filial. The descendants are always long-lasting and prosperous." Why are the descendants of loyal families so prosperous? Because they always think of the nation and bring benefits to the people. The blessings from benefiting so many people are huge. Therefore, everyone should think of the group, and recommend talented people. These actions will bring blessings to descendants.

"Hide the virtuous and suffer obvious punishment." Li Si harmed a virtuous person, Han Fei, and in the end, he and his son were cut in half at the waist and had no descendants. The descendants of loyal people will be long-lasting and prosperous. Those who harm virtuous people and harm the group will likely have no descendants. Therefore, we cannot be jealous. The evil acts caused by jealousy are extremely serious. These teachings should make us very aware. There is one more saying that I would like to explain: "One word that injures the harmony of heaven and earth." Why? They can't stand to see others doing well, so they slander and criticize those who do good deeds. Think about it, when other people have good fortune and do good deeds, if we criticize them, we corrupt our own hearts. Also, people who do good deeds are attacked by us, and this creates negative karma. Thirdly, if we criticize, those who hear it will not see the good qualities of that person, and will also develop prejudices. Not only have we not encouraged them to follow their example, but we have also caused them to become biased, and the harmony of the group will be destroyed by our mouths. This is disloyalty and unrighteousness! In the end, this will shake the people's hearts, "If that's the result of doing good, then don't do it! What's the point?" We will have blocked people's hearts. Therefore, don't underestimate one sentence. It can cause a group to have a good or bad atmosphere. Therefore, who is responsible for a harmonious society and a harmonious group? We are, it must begin with us. We cannot have feelings of jealousy.

We just talked about how destructive criticism is. Now, traditional culture is being rapidly promoted and developed throughout mainland China. Why? Because the national leaders are taking the lead. I remember when I gave a lecture not long ago, there were about 500 people. Everyone had a "Clean Plate Campaign" badge on their chest. We were very happy to see that. The Clean Plate Campaign means that everyone cleans their plates completely and doesn't waste food or act extravagantly. This is what our Chinese President Xi Jinping has been promoting. It is not only influencing the Chinese people, but also influencing the global Chinese community to follow his example. Therefore, an intelligent and virtuous leader is the blessing of the whole nation, and it is a trend that China will lead the world. Therefore, when Chinese leaders are virtuous, it is also a blessing for the entire world. The country is taking the lead, and now many places are very active. "A kind and gentle leader is like the parents of the people." When there are such leaders and sages, it's truly a blessing for the people.

There are also many people lecturing and spreading traditional culture in various places. In the coastal cities of China, the populations exceed five million. If there is a good teacher spreading Chinese culture in such a place, there will be many beneficiaries, possibly tens or even hundreds of thousands. Forty to fifty years ago, Teacher Li Bingnan taught in Taichung, Taiwan for thirty-eight years and had over 500,000 students. If we feel jealous, or criticize, someone who is highly respected by the people and is dedicated to spreading the Way, after we criticize them, the people of the area may lose confidence in them and will stop listening to their lectures, which will sever the Dharma connection with tens of thousands of people. People have two kinds of lives, physical life and wisdom life. Therefore, although it was only one sentence of criticism, it cut off the Dharma connection and the affinity of a large group of people. The karmic debt created is huge.

Therefore, in Buddhism, a very serious offense is called "The Four Grave Precepts." What is the first precept? “Do not slander the ruler of the nation." We cannot slander national leaders or the leaders of a group. If we slander them, the entire nation and the group will lose faith in the leaders, and the nation or group will be in great danger. Therefore, the karmic debt created by criticism is related to the number of people affected. We must be very careful.

For example, we cannot randomly criticize other people's parents. How important is the trust that children have for their parents for their own healthy personality development? If we make them doubt or distrust their parents, this is also creating grave karmic debt. Don’t harm other's parent-child or sibling relationships because of your own likes, dislikes, or even small personal gains. This will greatly diminish your blessings, as the Taiwanese would say, it's "going to be short-lived," it's terrible to destroy the natural bond between people. Don't break up other people's marriages, "Better to destroy ten bridges, than to break up one marriage." This is a metaphor for the severity of destroying someone's marriage. Of course, we should protect public property. We should not damage even the smallest and cheapest public property. Why? Because it’s the public's property. If we damage a public item worth only a dollar, for example in Malaysia, we would owe over 20 million people. Therefore, people who understand the principles will not do stupid things, because that's the taxpayers' money, and you would owe the whole nation. What's even worse is in China, you would not be able to repay such a debt even if you worked like an ox or a horse. If people don't understand the principles, they will unknowingly create huge karmic debt.

When we understand the principles, we won’t be jealous, criticize, or slander. Instead, we will accumulate great merit. What do we transform jealousy into? Confirmation, blessings, praise, emulation, and learning. Everyone will follow your example, and people will have even more faith in good people. All the people have faith in them, and you helped establish that trust. Their accomplishments are created through your own joy and praise.

In Chan Buddhism, the famous quote of the Sixth Patriarch Huineng is: "Originally, there is nothing. Where can dust settle?" We came into the world pure and clean. Why are we staining ourselves with so many bad habits and then not being able to return home, not being able to return to our original nature?

The Sixth Patriarch hid in the hunter's group for fifteen years. Therefore, these enlightened sages understand that everything has its own timing and conditions. We should wait for the right time and let things mature, not be impatient, and let it come naturally.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and natural English flow as a professional book translator would approach it:

**The Turning Point: When the Heart Moves**

Later, when the time was right, he emerged. It so happened that a group of monks were engaged in a debate about the Dao. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, and the temple flag fluttered. The first person said, “The flag is moving.” The second person said, “It’s not the flag moving; it’s the wind that’s moving.” The two argued incessantly. Finally, the Sixth Patriarch said, “It’s neither the wind nor the flag that’s moving; it’s the hearts of you gentlemen that are moving.” Notice his respect; he referred to them as ‘gentlemen’ whose hearts were moved. If you can grasp this story, then you will no longer make excuses in life or shift responsibility onto others.

“It’s not that I can’t do the job, it’s that my luck is terrible.” “It’s not that I can’t do the job, it’s that person who ruined it for me.” “It’s not that I can’t shoot arrows, it’s that these arrows are made by such-and-such company, and the quality is terrible.” “It’s not that I can’t have children, it’s because of bad feng shui.” It’s not the wind moving, not the flag moving; all excuses are blamed on others. Even the sun is at fault; even the God of Thunder is at fault. So if it's not their fault, whose fault is it? It’s that your own heart is moved.

“It’s because of him that I get angry.” You cannot learn the teachings of the sages with this kind of attitude. What are the teachings of the sages? They emphasize "inner learning." Don't push the blame outwards. "If you do not find progress in your actions, seek the fault within yourself." Therefore, the Sixth Patriarch said, “It’s neither the wind nor the flag that’s moving; it’s the hearts of you gentlemen that are moving.” At the time, the master of the monks was Dharma Master Yin Zong. He was a highly enlightened person. Upon hearing this, he immediately invited the Sixth Patriarch inside, “I’ve heard that the robe and bowl of the Chan lineage have been passed on. May I ask if you are the one who has received them?” Upon this question, the Sixth Patriarch revealed the robe and bowl.

Master Huineng had hidden among hunters for fifteen years, and had not yet been tonsured. Therefore, Dharma Master Yin Zong became his tonsure master. The Sixth Patriarch paid his respects to him as his master, and after that, Dharma Master Yin Zong tonsured him. After completing the tonsure for the Sixth Patriarch, Dharma Master Yin Zong, in turn, paid respects to the Sixth Patriarch as his master. Why would a master bow to his disciple as master? Because the Sixth Patriarch had already attained wisdom, and wisdom is the greatest teacher. Even though Dharma Master Yin Zong was his master in terms of seniority, this gesture of respect made all of his disciples have complete trust in Master Huineng. With this trust, when Master Huineng spoke, his students were likely to achieve enlightenment. They treasured his words, listened and acted immediately, gaining immense benefit. I ask you all, how great was the merit of Dharma Master Yin Zong’s act of reverence? He connected the karmic affinity of everyone present to an enlightened sage.

Therefore, “praising the good in others is goodness itself.” The accumulated merit is exceedingly profound. Especially in our current era, good news doesn’t travel far, but bad news… Open a newspaper, and what you read can be quite dizzying. However, we can’t blame them. Why? Because all media professionals should learn one lesson in university: the most crucial principle of journalism: “conceal evil, promote good.” Reporting all the bad things makes people who wouldn’t have known them in the first place learn them. Then the readers see such horrible things every day, and they all become afraid. The number of people with depression is increasing, and isn't this linked to the news? The media should think deeply about this. Every profession has its most important tasks and responsibilities. The media's role is to promote good customs in society. We have to admire the leaders in mainland China for this. Since 2007, every two years, they hold an election for moral role models. Over 100 million people participate in each selection, choosing hundreds of moral models, from those who demonstrate filial piety to those who show courage and acts of charity. There was one Ms. Xu Yuehua, who had her feet amputated when she was twelve years old, and who later took care of one hundred and thirty-eight orphans. When watching the program about these role models, no one can hold back their tears.

There was also a young girl whose father passed away when she was eight years old, and her mother was disabled, and there was an elderly grandmother. This eight year old girl was responsible for earning money. At age twelve she graduated top of her class, with a perfect score in all four subjects. When seeing her story, people could not help but cry, and feel that they could never be as good as this child. She helped her mother with her business, and even though she cooked delicious food, she had never eaten a single piece of it. Each item sold for a profit of 30 cents, and she couldn’t bear to eat any of it. When she showed her mother her perfect graduation results, her mother said that night when they were doing business, "You absolutely have to eat this today as a reward." Only then, reluctantly, did she eat something that she herself had sold for so many years. How considerate she was of her mother!

Seeing children like these, I feel that there is great hope for our nation. She was truly touching. As a result, the government organized an event called "Searching Among You - Seeking the Most Beautiful Filial Children," and selected the exemplary acts of filial piety demonstrated by children across China. Tens of millions of people participated, and who could participate without shedding tears and being moved? If our children see these examples from a young age, they would feel ashamed of themselves. Someone of that age is already carrying the responsibilities of their whole family, while I, who am several years older, am still behaving irresponsibly and squandering my parents' money. People have a conscience; their virtuous acts will awaken the good within a child.

I feel that a single phrase from Confucius can turn things around. What the Chinese leaders are doing embodies Confucius' teachings. Confucius said, "If teaching by example of good is ineffective, then use encouragement." Recognize all examples of goodness, especially in children. We, adults, after seeing their acts, feel like we want to hide ourselves. Seeing these children, we feel ashamed. This is 'promoting good.' For those who "cannot," do your best to support them and teach them, like the progressive policies in many countries that educate and provide skills to the disabled and unemployed so that they can make a living. For those truly without the ability to act for themselves, use the collective welfare of society to support them. This aligns with the next sentence: “When others face misfortune, do not rejoice at their suffering,” rather, have pity on them and help them. If you understand the implications of these two sentences, self-cultivation, family harmony, governing the state, and pacifying the world, are all contained within.

With China taking the lead, we hope the entire world will follow suit. Just by promoting these most filial children, we can educate everyone; it is certain. Why? Because everyone possesses filial piety. "At birth, man is inherently good." When the right conditions arise, it will surely be awakened. Everyone should go online and watch "Searching for the Most Beautiful Filial Children." You should watch it yourself first, don’t show it to your children without watching it yourself. First, move yourself to tears. Then, as you recount the stories of these exemplary children, the children will be deeply moved. They will proactively want to watch them, without being forced. People in the family naturally embrace the teachings of the sages. Why? Because when we are sincere, they will see it, they will be moved, they will have faith, and they will voluntarily study. “Speak for others.” It’s even okay to not let your children see it first. Instead, after watching it yourself, you should model the behavior. The children will notice, “My father has changed lately; he's so good to Grandpa and Grandma now.” The children will be curious, and when you tell them, “I was moved by these children,” they will go and watch the programs themselves.

When parents are constantly emulating the virtuous, this attitude becomes our family tradition. If a leader of a group constantly “praises the good in others, [and sees it as] goodness itself,” our group will learn to appreciate and learn from one another. This atmosphere will bring immense benefits to the group. It’s the same in a class. The teacher should lead by example. When seeing the good in others, they should not be jealous; instead, they should rejoice, praise, and emulate.

In the past, government officials had a profound sense of responsibility. They felt that their primary duty was to educate the people. The official’s hat had a particular significance. It was high at the back and low in the front. It was called the “Advancing the Worthy” hat. Its purpose was to encourage the recommendation of people with more virtue than oneself, and to praise the virtuous and encourage the state to utilize their talents. Wearing this hat, one would be constantly on the lookout for talent. Don’t look to the distant past; Lin Zexu of the Qing Dynasty would always carry a list of talented individuals. Wherever he went, he would make notes about them, in order to recommend them to the country.

Mr. Ouyang Xiu would always carry blank name cards. Upon hearing or observing that someone was discussing a person of virtuous character, praising that person's goodness, he would write that person’s name down, send the name card to their home, and then go visit them. After confirming that the person was as described, he would extensively praise that person. Ouyang Xiu promoted this practice of speaking well of others and spreading their good. The social atmosphere in the Song Dynasty was truly excellent because these great scholars and officials took the lead.

Du Yan, the prime minister of the Northern Song Dynasty, “when he heard of good in others, he rejoiced as if it were his own.” Liu Jixian Gong, “when he heard of good in others, praised it incessantly.” There was also the prime minister Han Qi, with whom we are all familiar, who "when he heard of the slightest good," would sigh and say, “I, Han Qi, am not as good as him,” “Qi suo bu ji.” Han Qi was highly virtuous. When he saw the good in others, he would immediately praise them, which would inspire others to emulate them.

Speaking of this, in the “Liao Fan’s Four Lessons” there is a passage, “We, living in a degenerate age, should not use our own strengths to suppress others; nor our own goodness to belittle others; nor our own abilities to corner others. Gather in your intelligence and wisdom, appear as though you have none. Be humble. When you see others’ faults, contain and cover them up.” Don't “spread other’s evils, which is evil itself.” It's not good to be “too harsh in criticism, for misfortune will arise.” One should “contain and cover others’ faults” so that “on one hand, they may be more willing to change, and on the other hand, they will feel restraint and not dare to indulge.” When others realize they are not being criticized, they will not dare to be reckless. “When you see others who have even a minor strength worth learning, or small act of good worth recording, immediately cast aside your own ways and follow them.” Why? Similar to Pang Tong in the Three Kingdoms period, his praise of others' virtues was sometimes exaggerated. When people asked him why, he replied, “There are few people who do good nowadays and many who do evil. We must help to change the customs and increase the good intentions of others. If I praise someone for ten things, maybe only five are accurate. Then others can emulate those five things. And the person being praised will realize they're not as great as I made them out to be, and will push themselves harder.”

Therefore, family scandals should not be made public. When family members have shortcomings, do not discuss them outside. Instead, praise the good qualities of family members. When these words reach the ears of the family members, they will think, “I’m not that good. I have so many bad habits, yet my wife is still so forgiving and praises me in public. I cannot let her down. I must live up to her trust.” Won't they be inspired? Pang Tong’s words are very important in today's world. We should often speak kind words, rejoice in others' merits, praise others' good deeds, and drive the good customs in our group, family, and society. Of course, praise must come from the heart, and we must truly see and understand others’ strengths in order to praise them.

Next, let us examine the next sentence:

**When others face misfortune, do not rejoice at their suffering.**

*‘Misfortune’* refers to disaster, and *‘suffering’* refers to distress. This could include falling ill, losing one's job, losing a loved one, natural disasters or personal misfortunes. This is what we mean by *‘misfortune and suffering.’* Let us calmly consider why we should not rejoice in the suffering of others. It is because everyone experiences good and bad fortune at unpredictable times. Is there anyone who goes through life without facing any misfortune? It is impossible. Some may experience more good fortune than bad, while others may experience more bad fortune than good, but no one's life is consistently smooth. We understand that everyone experiences good and bad fortune at any moment, and this is something we ourselves could experience. If others face misfortune and we rejoice in their suffering and kick them when they are down, we are creating negative karma. We must deeply believe in the principle of cause and effect: "You reap what you sow." When others experience misfortune, and we rejoice at it, what will happen when we encounter misfortune ourselves? People will say, "Heaven has eyes, he finally got what he deserved." So, believe deeply in cause and effect; even thoughts have their own cause and effect. As we have just emphasized, we must love ourselves. If we kick others when they are down, we injure our own capacity for benevolence. It is too harsh and cruel, without compassion and empathy.

There is a book called *Geyan Lianbi* (A Collection of Maxims), which is a very insightful classic. During the Republic of China period, a sage named Mr. Li Shutong became a monk, and was known as Master Hongyi. He was especially compassionate, and he selected the most essential maxims and compiled them into *Geyan Bielu* (Selected Maxims). In *Geyan Bielu,* there is a saying, "What Creation abhors: Harshness and Cunning." *‘Creation’* refers to the natural world, it refers to God. What is the most detested? Those who are harsh and cruel are the most likely to lose their blessings. This goes against the benevolent nature of Heaven. To act against Heaven is to be “harsh.” Kicking someone when they are down is an example of this. *“Cunning”* refers to being sly or having little cleverness. What is being cunning for? To benefit oneself at the expense of others because of selfishness and self-interest. Cleverness can become self-defeating. Harming others is never to one’s benefit. Harming others is harming yourself and reducing your own blessings.

Confucius spoke of "Five Unpropitious Signs": The first unpropitious sign is “benefiting oneself at the expense of others, which is an unpropitious sign for oneself.” Second, “abandoning the elderly and favoring the young,” showing no concern for the elderly, and spoiling the children is “an unpropitious sign for the family.” Third, “abandoning the virtuous and employing the unworthy, which is an unpropitious sign for the state.” Fourth, “the elderly not teaching and the young not learning, which is an unpropitious sign for society.” Fifth, "the wise are in hiding, and the foolish seize power, which is an unpropitious sign for the world." Are these signs of good fortune or disorder? These are all key. This applies to both families and states.

In ancient times, there was an official named Li Shiheng, who was sent as an envoy to Goryeo (present-day Korea). His deputy was named Yu Ying. Later, when the envoys returned, both had received some gifts. Yu Ying thought to himself that because the sea air was damp, he would put all the things belonging to his superior Li Shiheng at the bottom, which would be most damp, and his own things on top. This was an act of sly cleverness; not respecting his leader. He allowed his leader's things to be placed at the bottom, while placing his own things on top, hoping to benefit himself through small gains. As they returned, there was a maritime disaster. The ship was about to capsize. In order to reduce the ship’s weight, they had to throw items overboard. Obviously, lives are more important than gifts. They started throwing all of the items on top into the sea. Yu Ying’s face turned pale. He originally used his petty cleverness, but in the end, all of his own items were thrown overboard. If you act against the intention of Heaven, you are bound to attract misfortune. “See the gains of others as if they were your own, and see the losses of others as if they were your own.” This is the proper intention. Having this intention, when others experience misfortune, you would have empathy and compassion; you would naturally have the loving heart that thinks, “When others are hungry, I am hungry; when others are drowning, I am drowning.” As a national leader, one would provide for “the elderly, the widowed, the orphaned, the destitute, and the disabled,” ensuring that they are all taken care of.

Our CEO, Mr. Wu, is an entrepreneur. I feel that entrepreneurs have a very high standing in modern society, because they have a strong sense of national mission. As I mentioned earlier, the “Searching for the Most Beautiful Filial Children” program was supported by the state, and entrepreneurs donated money to help families facing difficult circumstances. The state organized this, the officials helped out, and the entrepreneurs offered their help, so everyone joined forces to do good deeds.

Our CEO, Mr. Wu, discovered that in China there are 85,000 children left behind while their parents work away from home. These children are unable to receive sufficient love from their parents. He felt heartache, and so he established a foundation to help the children left behind. He then led a group of other entrepreneurs to care for and love these children, allowing their parents to take time off from work, while still receiving their pay, in order to spend time with their children. This demonstrates an ability to see the hardships and sufferings in others' lives, and to use their resources to help them. This way, we can ensure that “the elderly can be cared for until their end, the able-bodied are put to work, the young grow up healthily, and the widowed, orphaned, destitute, and disabled are all provided for.” Next time I’ll share with you how entrepreneurs help people with disabilities.

Okay, that’s all for this lesson. Thank you all.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a natural reading experience:

**Lecture 26: Helping in Times of Trouble: Starting with Those Around You; Letting Go of Greed: Beginning with Fame and Fortune**

Esteemed elders and friends, good day to you all! The verse we shared last time was: 

【人有禍患。不可生喜幸心。】
*“When others encounter misfortune, one must not feel joy or a sense of schadenfreude.”*

When people experience disasters or hardships, not only should we not take pleasure in their misfortune, but we should also cultivate feelings of compassion and sympathy. Especially given recent world events where some disasters have occurred, such as the serious typhoon in the Philippines, we should do what we can to provide support, both financially and materially.  Today, the Earth is like a village, a “global village,” and all of its inhabitants should help and love one another.

Modern physicists, especially quantum physicists, have discovered that the power of human thought is tremendous.  The power of thought can even change the trajectory of planets. These scientists, therefore, emphasize the concept of “mind over matter,” using the power of thought to change the environment and physical reality.  In fact, this concept aligns very well with the teachings of our ancestors.  Our ancestors in the “Book of Documents” (尚書) told us, “Doing good will bring a hundred blessings; doing evil will bring a hundred calamities.” If we, the vast population of humanity, can generate compassion and sympathy, these disasters will dissolve into nothingness. As citizens of Earth, we each must have a sense of responsibility. Since the power of thought is so strong, we should nurture good thoughts every day and bless the world.

The ancients had excellent role models, such as the great scholar Shao Yong of the Song Dynasty. Every morning after washing, he would respectfully light incense and recite a prayer. This prayer is very moving, and it inspires us to emulate his actions. He would say: “Every morning, I light a stick of incense, giving thanks to Heaven, Earth, and my ruler. I only ask that the crops in every field ripen, and that everyone may live a long life. May our country have wise ministers to secure the nation, and may families have no rebellious children to trouble their parents. May peace reign in all directions and weapons be laid down. If I am poor, I will not mind it.” Master Shao Yong lit incense every morning, and the magnitude of his intention accumulated a great amount of blessings. When we study the “Zhu Zi’s Family Management Maxims”, we should, as parents and elders, create blessings for our descendants.  It is said that “a family that accumulates good deeds will surely have abundant blessings.” Accumulating virtue and practicing good deeds must begin from the roots – working on one's heart and mind, as the field of blessings is cultivated by the heart.

We have previously studied “Liao Fan’s Four Lessons.” You all surely remember the story of Mr. Wei Zhongda.  The sins he committed by the time he was in his forties were so numerous, they could hardly fit in a whole house. However, his records of good deeds amounted to only one scroll, yet the power of that one scroll surpassed all his evil deeds. This revealed a principle to him: his one act of good was for the sake of all the people under heaven, “A thought from the ruler is for the sake of all the people.”  Now as we learn from Shao Yong, “a thought from the ruler” is for all under heaven, for the entire world. How can we benefit from our study of classical texts?  Simply reading is knowledge; applying it immediately to our daily lives is practice, and through practice, we will receive blessings and benefits.

Firstly, if we recite this passage every day, our mood will be cheerful and pleasant all day, and our hearts will expand.  “Giving thanks to Heaven, Earth, and my ruler,” can also be expressed as “giving thanks to the three luminaries”: the sun, the moon, and the stars. Without the sun and the moon, how could all things grow?  We also need to be grateful to our rulers and our nation. There are still many places experiencing war, so we are very fortunate and blessed. We should be grateful for this good fortune and not take it for granted.

There was a scholar who also lit incense every morning between three and five o’clock, and then began giving thanks, “Thank you, Heaven, for bestowing another day of leisure upon me.” After his wife heard him saying this for some time, one day she laughed, “We eat only vegetables and tofu every day. How can you say you are enjoying a life of leisure?” The scholar replied, “Firstly, there is no war in our country, which is a great blessing, or we would be homeless. We must be grateful for our country.  Secondly, we are not hungry and not cold, which is the second blessing.  There are no sick people in bed, and no one in our family is imprisoned, which is the third blessing. How can we not have peace and leisure? How can we not be grateful? So, we thank Heaven and Earth for nourishing us."

In fact, if humans do not thank Heaven and Earth, our sense of gratitude will continually decline. Heaven and Earth nurture us. When people forget their parents, those who have been kind to them, and the grace of Heaven and Earth, they will take all acts of kindness for granted.  When we recite this passage, we should ask ourselves, “Why are the children of today not grateful?” We need to reflect: how many acts of gratitude have we shown them for them to experience, emulate, and learn?

I have two younger cousins who have been very well-behaved since childhood. They are religious, so every time they eat, they express gratitude to Heaven for its blessings. Because their hearts are so pure from a young age, this kind of attitude has already taken root. Therefore, they do not demand things from others, but always know to be grateful and make contributions.  "A habit formed in childhood becomes one's nature." After listening to Shao Yong’s words, let's see how many people will get up tomorrow to light incense. This will become a family tradition. Do not underestimate one single action; if you do it for three or five years, the attitude alone will touch those around you.

“I only ask that the crops in every field ripen” means that all grains can be abundant, and no one will starve. There are many people who die of starvation every day on Earth, especially in Africa. We should use our good thoughts to bless, “May crops in every field ripen,” and “May everyone live a long life.”  "May our country have wise ministers to secure the nation" refers to the country, hoping that every nation will have virtuous leaders and officials who will govern well. “And may families have no rebellious children to trouble their parents” means, may each family have filial children and virtuous grandchildren and that they not disobey their parents.  “Parents” sounds very warm and familiar. Nowadays, people mostly say “Dad and Mom.” Take note of the Chinese character “娘” (niáng - mother); on the left is the character for “woman” (女), and on the right is the character for “good” (良). So, only a kind woman can be a mother.  These two words “爹” (diē - father) and “娘” (niáng - mother) sound especially warm, why? Because my mother referred to my maternal grandfather and grandmother as "Ah Die" and "Ah Niang". Thus, these two words feel particularly affectionate. "May peace reign in all directions and weapons be laid down," means that there should be no more wars and that the world should be peaceful and stable.  "If I am poor, I will not mind it,” implies, what does it matter if I am a bit poor?

When we see the verse that “when others encounter misfortune,” we should cultivate kind thoughts and sincerely bless them. Master Shao Yong is a good role model. We should cultivate a blessing heart and the sense of “if others are hungry, it is as if I am hungry; if others drown, it is as if I am drowning.” Where do we begin? We begin with our closest friends, relatives, and colleagues.  In traditional culture, self-cultivation, family management, national governance, and world peace are to be attained by beginning with those closest to us. Therefore, if our relatives and friends are experiencing hardships, we should fulfil our sense of morality, the “morality of sharing wealth.” We must be able to let go of what is difficult to let go of, do what is difficult to do. We must emphasize morality, our sense of loyalty and duty; and we should place less importance on profit and money.

In “Liao Fan’s Four Lessons,”  Shu Weng of Jiangxi served as a private tutor for two years. When he encountered those in trouble, he gave all of his two years’ worth of tuition fees to help them pay their debts, lest they be separated from their families.  As a result, he had no savings for the two years and went hungry on the journey home. This is truly a hard thing to let go of.  When he returned home, he said, "Please quickly prepare a meal for me."  His wife replied, "We have run out of rice.  We’ve already borrowed many times from the neighbors. They are all waiting for you to return the money." Then he told his wife about using all his two years of salary to help others pay their debts. What is truly praiseworthy is that his wife immediately said, "Oh, I see."  She didn't scold him. She thought her husband’s action was also a good deed, and it was admirable. “It's okay, I have a way." She then went into the mountains to dig for wild vegetables to make sure he was well-fed. That very night, the couple heard a voice outside the window: “Tonight, you eat wild vegetables; next year, you will produce a top scholar.” The couple had no children yet, so they quickly got up to bow down to heaven in gratitude. Sure enough, she became pregnant the following year. At the age of seventeen, their son became a top scholar. 

Therefore, “you have to be able to let go of what is difficult to let go of.”  Our ancestors told us, “Let go and you will gain.” The more difficult it is to let go, the greater the merit. "The morality of sharing wealth."

"Not slighting the poor and lowly." Even after we become rich and powerful, we must remember the kindness and loyalty of our relatives and friends, and we should never slight them. We should help them whenever they are in need. "Not abandoning them in hardship." We should start these actions within ourselves.

Wang Fengyi of Northeast China not only showed filial piety towards his parents but also to his grandparents. Furthermore, he took care of the next generation of all his siblings, being especially loyal and righteous. We are all deeply touched by his actions. Now is the time we must have unwavering faith in “At the beginning, people are naturally good.”  However, why has this innate goodness not been manifested?  It is because they have not encountered a good environment, good influences, and role models that can awaken the goodness within them.  My friends, who will be the role models?  We should remember Mencius’ words, “In this day and age, if not me, then who will?”  We must have this sense of responsibility.

During the Tang Dynasty, there was a famous minister named Di Renjie. When Di Renjie was young, he was not yet a high-ranking official. He was a legal clerk in Bingzhou. One of his colleagues, whose surname was Zheng, had a very elderly and ill mother. He was assigned to a distant post in a remote area with poor transportation, probably over a thousand miles away.  When Di Renjie learned of this, he thought, "His mother is so old and ill.  If her son is transferred so far away, the mother will be so worried, she may not be able to survive it.”  “See the loss of others as your own loss”.  Seeing others in this difficult situation was as if it were his own. So, he took the initiative to see his superior, Master Lin Renji, saying, "Our colleague Mr. Zheng’s mother is in such a state, can I be assigned to that location instead?" When we often read the “Twenty-Five Histories,” we see these saints and sages who are recorded in history. Their filial piety, loyalty, trustworthiness, righteousness, morality and sense of honor broaden our horizons, allowing us to appreciate the preciousness of their intentions.

Master Lin Renji was deeply moved by his words. He immediately thought of the conflict and opposition he was having with another colleague. The entire group was aware of their disagreement. Here was Di Renjie, willing to travel thousands of miles for a colleague, yet he was still having conflict with his colleague.  He immediately felt ashamed and took the initiative to apologize to Li Sima. Both of them apologized, and they reconciled.

That is the end of the story. Esteemed elders and friends, are there people in our workplace we find unpleasant? From where does traditional culture begin? It begins with expanding our minds, being more inclusive, and accepting those we find unpleasant. This is true self-cultivation – having empathy for our colleagues. Furthermore, we should “universally love all.” “All people are to be loved.” The most important thing our society is missing is love. Love can resolve all conflicts and disputes. In the previous lecture, I mentioned how entrepreneurs practice the “Great Harmony” in the “Book of Rites.” Under the leadership of CEO Wu Nianbo, his organization cares for the left-behind children in China. These children lack the love and companionship of their parents, so they initiated a foundation to care for left-behind children. They encouraged more businesses to give employees time to return home to spend time with their children. Their employees can take two or three days of leave per year to spend time with their children because these children are our country and nation’s future.  This love is also a form of empathy for the needs of these left-behind children.

We once invited Chairman Hao Tielong to share his experiences at the center. When I was listening to his lecture, I saw that he was indeed practicing every sentence of the “Great Harmony” in his company.  "When the Great Way prevails, all under Heaven will belong to everyone."  His company continuously holds lectures on traditional culture. People from all walks of life come to his company for training, and even local party schools train their officials there. He is thinking of the greater good and for the sake of all. “Choosing the virtuous and capable and promoting mutual trust and harmony.” Helping to train officials is beneficial. Perhaps many of them can enhance their love for their country through these courses. By taking care of so many people from all walks of life, “Promoting mutual trust and harmony. Therefore, people do not care only for their own parents, and they do not treat only their own children as children. That the elderly may have support in their old age, the strong their place, and the young be properly raised.”  The most important part of “The elderly having support in their old age” is to ensure that the younger generation understands to be grateful and to repay kindness. All of this must be done through education in traditional culture. His company also selects employees’ children, and those with filial actions are selected to be “filial children.”  “The young to be properly raised,” of the many virtues, filial piety is the first. The company encourages children to practice filial piety from a young age.

"The widowed, the orphaned, the lonely, the disabled are all provided for."  About 30% of his company’s employees are disabled. Of course, first, we must thank the national policy that allows companies to care for those who are unfortunate or disadvantaged.  Second, we must thank the entrepreneurs themselves for their proactive efforts.  He also said that the disabled employees are more diligent than normal employees.  “Those who love others will always be loved; those who respect others will always be respected.” When we cultivate love and compassion for these disadvantaged and unfortunate people, we will receive the benefit of even more diligent employees. Therefore, “What you give is what you get in return.”  When we think about how those around us, our relatives and friends, should treat us, that is the result, and the reason is how we treat them.

One’s self-cultivation must continuously improve, and we should care for not only our relatives and friends but all those who we have a connection with.  There are several passages in Islamic teachings that are very impressive.  One is: "Speak justly in times of hate and joy." When we have emotions, whether of hate or joy, we still have to be fair in our speech. This is self-cultivation. Normally, if we dislike someone, we cannot see their good points. We may even hold our grudges in our hearts and find an opportunity to take our frustrations out on them.  However, this passage tells us, though there might have been a disagreement, our hearts must still be peaceful, and our speech must still be fair.  When people are very happy or excited, wanting to give gifts or rewards, it is easy to be unfair. Whether we are feeling hate or joy, these are tests of our self-cultivation. We must remain unbiased and fair in our actions.

"Give support to those who have cut ties with you, take care of those who have abandoned you, and forgive those who have been unjust to you.” Lao Tzu said, “repay resentment with virtue.” Because if revenge is repaid with revenge, it will never end.  Therefore, people should be rational and not hold grudges against others. We should form many positive relationships. We must think of ways to resolve any past unpleasantries, turning major issues into minor ones, and minor issues into nothing.  “To be tolerant is to be great,” The ability to be tolerant of others is a blessing.

In fact, forgiving others is also giving yourself an opportunity for growth and a blessing. When we forgive others, our hearts expand; our self-cultivation improves. Therefore, loving others is loving ourselves, and we will certainly receive benefits. When you are filled with hate and rage, it will not do them any harm, but you will have nightmares. Right? Does the person we hate the most appear in our dreams? Aren’t we making things difficult for ourselves?  Therefore, our ancestors remind us, do not bring trouble on ourselves; do not cause suffering for ourselves; do not dig your own grave; and seek blessings for ourselves. Good and bad fortune may be the result of a single thought. Therefore, “When others encounter misfortune, one must not feel joy or a sense of schadenfreude.” With this, misfortune will not come to pass. Furthermore, what will happen? Misfortune can be turned into good fortune. When we generate love, empathy, and compassion, we cultivate the heart to care for others.

Let’s move on to the next line:

【善欲人見。不是真善。】
*"Good done for the sake of being seen is not true good."*

If our good deeds are done for the sake of being known by others, or if we boast about our good deeds in front of others, perhaps with ulterior motives, then it is not true good. There’s an idiom that says “to seek fame and fish for reputation.” What then is true good? “Liao Fan’s Four Lessons” tells us, “To benefit others is public; what is public is true.”  When all of our actions are for the benefit of others, with a public-minded heart, then that is true good.  "To benefit oneself is private." If our actions have ulterior motives, whether it is for fame or profit, then it is selfish and self-serving. "To benefit oneself is private; what is private is false,” and this is not true good, but false good.

In fact, doing good should be our duty as humans. Humans, positioned between Heaven and Earth, are a trinity with the two, are the most intelligent of all beings. We are capable of being like Heaven and Earth, nurturing and caring for all things.  Therefore, service and helping others should be the natural flow of our inherent goodness, and we should feel that doing good is our duty, the morality that we must fulfill. If we receive praise for our good deeds, we will feel a little embarrassed. Not only do we not seek fame, but we also feel that we are not worthy of it.

I have previously mentioned Mr. Wang Xihai of Dalian, Northeast China, who is a filial son.  When I first learned about Mr. Wang Xihai, it was through a program called “Parents of the World.” His father had a stroke and was immobile. He took care of his father, taking care of him until his father turned eighty. He had been bedridden for more than twenty years, yet his skin was still very elastic. Although he took care of his father day and night, we could see that he was very robust. He had forgotten about himself. After his father passed away, Mr. Wang Xihai began doing volunteer work to repay those who had been kind to him. He had cared for over a hundred elderly people. When he meets an elderly person at the hospital, he treats them as if they were his own father. It is true that, “Those who love their parents dare not dislike others.” The filial piety in his heart manifests, and seeing every elderly person evokes in him the natural flow of goodness and filial piety.

Mr. Wang Xihai mentioned that in the hospital, just by observing a single action from the elderly, he could understand their feelings, for a true heart can communicate with everything.  Some nurses pull up the bedsheets of the elderly people because they are afraid of them getting dirty. They simply want to reduce their workload and do not take into consideration the elderly’s dignity.  When they do that action, the elderly may slightly pull their legs up. Mr. Wang Xihai can understand the elderly’s feelings.  The elderly have their dignity as well. When they are pulled up like that, and they are not wearing pants, it is very uncomfortable.

Mr. Wang said that where do illnesses of the elderly come from? Many illnesses are the result of them working too hard for the sake of their children. So the “Kneeling Sheep” song says, “When father is sick, it’s because he has labored too much for his son; when mother is worried, it’s because her son has not yet achieved.” When our job is not stable, there is discord between husband and wife, and we cannot change our bad habits, such as drinking alcohol which damages our body, then our parents are constantly worried.

Mr. Wang also mentioned that when the elderly become ill, they are afraid that they will become a burden to their children. Even after falling ill, they are still thinking of their children. When their children come to visit, the elderly will say, "You should go back. You have many things to take care of at home; hurry back.”  All they are thinking about is their children. Some children may be a bit impatient after taking care of them for a few days, complaining in the hallways outside the hospital room. But the elderly can hear everything, and it breaks their hearts.

In July, I went to Nanjing to attend a training course for principals. Over a hundred principals and kindergarten directors attended the course. I was also fortunate that Mr. Wang Xihai’s class was scheduled for those days. He gave one lecture, and we were truly moved to tears. There was a teacher, who was likely a principal, who after listening to the lecture for over an hour, in front of more than a hundred people, and probably in front of her colleagues, immediately raised her hand and said to Mr. Wang, “Mr. Wang, I am sorry to my mother-in-law. I have been a wolf in human’s clothing. I am so unfilial.” She was so moved by Mr. Wang Xihai’s filial piety that her conscience was awakened. People have a conscience; when they encounter a person of utmost filial piety, their goodness will be awakened.

I remember when Mr. Wang Xihai was praised for being filial on “Parents of the World,” he was always humbled and fearful, saying, “I have not done enough.” In 2011, Moral Model Xu Yuehua had both of her legs completely amputated at the age of twelve. She was sent to a welfare center when she was seventeen. Half a month later, she volunteered to take care of the children. The director of the welfare center was surprised and asked, “We are not good enough at taking care of you, and you want to take care of the children?” But she did, for 37 years, raising 138 orphans. She walks with a wooden stool, which is several centimeters thick. She has gone through several tens of those stools in over 30 years. How far has she walked? Her heart is so soft, many of the children have pre-existing conditions, and sometimes, their saliva might unintentionally drool onto her hand or face. She said that she never dares to wipe it off. Truly loving and filial people have very soft hearts, like Mr. Wang Xihai, who can immediately sense the feelings of the elderly. Xu Yuehua can immediately sense the feelings of the children, “They already have pre-existing conditions. They also have their self-esteem, so if their saliva gets on you, and you immediately wipe it off, it might hurt their feelings.” So Ms. Xu said, she absolutely will not wipe off the saliva.

Let me know if you have more to translate.


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and fluency while maintaining the tone and spirit of the original:

**Title: (Implied: Reflections on True Virtue and Self-Cultivation)**

I once took my students to visit children with brain disabilities. Seeing them, I truly felt they were very pitiable. They lacked the ability to control their actions, and their saliva would just drool out. When I brought my students there, they were afraid to approach, seeing the children’s drool. So, the most important thing we can teach our children is to be proactive. I took the initiative to spend time with these children, talking to them, and hugging them. It’s true, there was a lot of drool, and it got all over my clothes and body. My students watched for a while, and slowly they began to approach as well, no longer minding the mess.

True kindness and filial piety come from the heart. They seek absolutely no reward, have no ulterior motive, and are not mixed with selfishness. That’s why they are true goodness. The *Liaofan’s Four Lessons* says, “What is rooted in the heart is real; what is imitated is false.” When you act from the heart, it is genuine. When you just put on a show, your heart does not hold true kindness or love. The text also says, “Acting without attachment is true.” “Without attachment” means you act without holding onto the deed afterward. “Acting with attachment is false.” If you do something and then dwell on it, or have an ulterior motive, that’s "acting with attachment," which is not genuine goodness. This is how to discern the real from the false.

“Goodness that desires to be seen” refers to good deeds that we publicly announce and show off, so that everyone knows about them. This is called “yang” (exposed) good. There is also “yin” (hidden) virtue. “Yin” virtue refers to good deeds that we do without publicizing them, so that others are unaware. This is called accumulating hidden virtue. *Liaofan’s Four Lessons* discusses “yin and yang” in detail, saying, “All good that is done and known by others, even desired to be known, is yang good. Good that is done without others knowing is yin virtue.” “Yin virtue is rewarded by Heaven.” When we accumulate hidden virtue, Heaven bestows blessings. “Yang good yields worldly fame.” Fame is also a kind of blessing. If what we do must be known by others, that blessing has already been used, and there is no hidden virtue. Therefore, “fame is what the Creator abhors.” What is abhorred? Fame that exceeds reality, and virtue that does not match one's position—these things diminish our blessings. Pay close attention, especially to public figures with great fame. If their private conduct is terrible, the loss of blessings is severe. Many public figures have short lives, perhaps because they enjoyed great fame while their virtue could not keep up. What’s worse, they might even have influenced society badly, corrupting the next generation of teenagers and children. Such public figures have their lifespans drastically reduced.

The true principles of life are right before our eyes. If we pay attention, we can see them clearly. Every title carries a responsibility; it’s not meant for showing off, or flexing your muscles. So, officials who act like bureaucrats are wrong. “If an official doesn’t govern for the people, he might as well go home and sell sweet potatoes.” When you take office, you should bring benefit to the local people, to be worthy of the title of “local official.” Being called “manager” should not make you too happy; a manager should take good care of those under their charge. Everyone, when our children first say “Papa” with their little voices, aren’t we happy? Don’t be too happy; every title comes with a responsibility. “To raise without teaching is a father’s fault; to teach without rigor is a teacher’s laziness.” So, when we go to school and are called “teacher,” we can’t let ourselves become overweight. Why? As a teacher, our duty is “to transmit the Way, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts.” If I’m called a teacher and haven’t done these things, then I don’t live up to the name. Do you understand why I’m so slender? People with blessings are usually not this thin. My fame is too high, but my virtue is too low. Raising my virtue will also take time. That’s why I feel particularly touched when I read this passage: “People fear fame as pigs fear fat.” “Those whose fame is great but their virtue is not equal to it often suffer unusual calamities.” After I read this sentence, I walk very carefully on the streets. Of course, self-reliance and courageous progress are always the right course.

The next sentence is also very important: “Those who have no faults but are wrongly given a bad name often see their descendants rapidly prosper.” If you have done nothing wrong, but you are misunderstood, slandered, or insulted, harming your reputation, your descendants will often flourish. This tells us that if people owe you, Heaven will repay you. So, the affairs of the world are actually quite fair; don’t feel resentment. When you’re cursed, your descendants can suddenly rise. I’ve seen this myself. When we were young, there was an illiterate couple in our neighborhood. Many people made fun of them, calling them “stupid,” “fools,” and “oxen.” They were always being scolded, but they just laughed and never retorted. Later, their children all became quite successful. It corresponds to the saying that “their descendants often rapidly prosper.”

Dear friends, does everyone want to have peaceful days? What are peaceful days? “Every day is a good day, every moment is a good moment; everyone is a good person, and every event is a good event.” Do you want to live like this? Yes. When do we start? Right now. If we understand this sentence, we can live those kinds of days. When people insult us, they are sending us blessings because our descendants will suddenly rise. Then, I ask you, is there really anything bad in the world? There is truly nothing bad. Change your perspective, and everything becomes a good thing. It’s called turning afflictions into enlightenment, turning crises into opportunities, turning grief and anger into strength. Heaven and hell are not outside; they are right here, within one thought. With such a shift in thinking, everyone becomes a good person; those who curse me are actually sending me blessings. Starting tomorrow, when someone curses you, just say, “Thank you for sending me blessings.” They won’t be able to keep cursing you. When people curse each other, it just shows they are on the same level. If one person is cursing and the other says, “Thank you,” the cursing can’t continue.

These scriptures actually give us great insights into life. Everyone should practice turning from hell to heaven. Dear friends, do you have any worries or troubles in your heart? Yes. Then why do you continue to be bothered by them? How foolish! Turn them around immediately! Are there some that you can't turn? Yes. Then ask others for help. “When there are doubts in your heart, record them immediately.” Life is precious. We should use our time to be filial to our parents and accumulate merit and virtue. Why waste it being worried and troubled? You need to learn to change. If you can do that, your child will surely be an optimistic person, and no event in their life will be a bad one. This is really how it is; good or bad depends on your thoughts.

There is something we should reflect on when we do good. Many people like to donate money but won't actively help their own siblings in need. This is improper. Some people do volunteer work but leave their mother-in-law without food to eat. This is a big flaw. I’ve heard of such real cases myself. There is something even worse. A mother complained, "My child goes out to talk about filial piety, but is not filial to me!" *Liaofan's Four Lessons* should give us another reminder. "We should consider the overall effect rather than the immediate action, the long-term rather than the short-term, and the impact on society rather than on ourselves." If that mother’s complaint spreads, people in the community will not believe in traditional culture. They’ll think, “If the lecturer doesn't even respect their own mother, we shouldn’t listen to their lectures. We shouldn’t learn this traditional culture.” That person would then be committing a great sin, smearing the name of traditional culture.

If you cannot move those closest to you, the most intimate people, how can you move those who are farther away? It’s putting the cart before the horse. Why this reversal? It's because they’re doing it all for others’ praise, seeking vanity and not true goodness. A businessman often donated money, but when his brother had financial difficulties, he remembered exactly how much money he lent him. After taking a class, he reflected, “I’m just seeking fame and praise. I’m so calculating with my own brother, yet I donate money to show others.” Afterward, he went back and told his brother, “You don't need to repay that money.” He also found a very nice house for his brother, settling his family. His brother wept tears of gratitude, and his mother was the happiest of all. This is “goodness that desires to be seen; it is not true goodness.”

The next sentence says:

**“Evil that fears to be known is great evil.”**

If we do bad things but try to hide them, so that others will not know, then "if a fault can be corrected, it will disappear; if it is covered up, one will incur another fault.” And if you cover it up, the evil will gradually get bigger. "Do not fail to do good because it is small, and do not do evil because it is small." If evil is not stopped, it will grow larger. As the saying goes, “Steal a needle when you’re young, and steal gold when you’re grown.” When we speak of this, a child’s education becomes important. When they make a mistake, they should have the courage to admit it, and not cover it up.

We know the familiar story of George Washington cutting down the cherry tree. He had the courage to admit it to his father. So, evil must be able to be corrected. You must be willing to admit it and correct it, and you need three kinds of heart. *Liaofan's Four Lessons* says you must cultivate a “heart of shame.” Have a sense of shame, feeling that you've done wrong and let your parents down. “If virtue is damaged, one brings shame to their parents.” This is where shame comes from. Also, have a heart of reverence: I’ve done wrong, there are gods above, and I must not repeat the mistake. Have a “heart of courage,” the courage to admit your wrongs, and the courage to correct them.

Okay, since we want to teach children to have courage, actions speak louder than words. Everyone, have we ever done something wrong at work? Have we ever had arguments or disputes with others? Perhaps. Did we apologize? “If we cover up our faults, we add another fault. If we correct them, they disappear.” If the bad action is to be disrespectful towards our parents, then we should even have more courage to apologize. We’ve also heard of cases where, after a tantrum against their mother, a person knows it was wrong, but doesn't want to lose face. So, people who are overly concerned with their image create great obstacles for themselves. “If we cover up our faults, we add another fault,” which is a sin on top of a sin. As we were saying, the person who threw a tantrum at his mother, his mother died the next day. Life is impermanent, and he lived with regret for his entire life, never getting a chance to apologize to his mother. Therefore, people must immediately face their mistakes, and have the courage to apologize and correct them.

*Standards for Being a Good Student* also tells us: “When praised, be fearful (lest the praise is undeserved); when criticized, be pleased.” “When criticized, be pleased” is the cause, and “straightforward and honest friends will gradually grow close” is the good effect. We plant a cause and reap an effect. When we have the generosity to accept the advice of others, we attract many honest and kind friends to help us on the path of spiritual and virtuous development. So, we should not only not fear people knowing our evils, but when people point them out, we should have the courage to say, “Thank you for reminding me, I will correct myself for you to see.” What is this? It’s knowing and cherishing the connections we have with others. When someone is so honest, and they are doing it for our benefit, how can we treasure their goodwill? Cherish the connection, and change for them to see, so that their efforts will not have been in vain.

Everyone, who is most clear about our mistakes? The one in the midst of it is confused; the one on the sidelines sees clearly. The person closest to us, our spouse, sees most clearly. Has everyone remembered something that their spouse has reminded them of? “It seems like they just reminded me a few days ago, and we’ve already been in a cold war for five days.” It’s often true that people don’t know how fortunate they are. The people closest to us see us most clearly. If we are willing to listen, we will receive the greatest benefit. And also, if a person’s cultivation cannot move even the person closest to them, and they still claim to have learned so much, then "I can not believe," and I also don’t believe it. Moreover, what does that become? Self-deception.

If the people around us don't recognize us, and we go out often to give talks, in the end, we'll feel guilty or else become arrogant, and we'll be unable to see our problems. So, on the path of self-cultivation, don't deceive yourself. This is the most tragic thing in life. We must first have the magnanimity to listen to the advice of those closest to us, and think about what they’ve advised us about. Have we corrected those things? Then we must put in great effort to change for them to see. If you truly make changes, your whole family will have a completely new perspective on traditional culture. Many people think, “I’ve studied so hard, but why does my family seem to lack the good seeds?” They don't study. You’re mistaken, it’s all reversed. It may not be that they lack good roots, but that *we* lack good roots. We’re not doing well enough, so it's hard for them to believe.

What are good roots? “When you act, and you can’t succeed, look within yourself,” that’s what is called good roots. Because we are the first to learn, the entire family’s faith in traditional culture is established upon the first learner. Has anyone thought when hearing this, “How awful, why do I have to be the first?” That kind of thinking is wrong. The first to learn must take on the responsibility. Isn't that right? Let me tell you, we have the same fate. What fate? There's no way back. We can only move forward, just like the saying about burning the boats. When people have a way back, they absolutely cannot breakthrough or improve. Why? "I’ll do it tomorrow, I’ll do it tomorrow," they will be negligent and never change. “There is no shortage of intelligent and outstanding people, so the reason they do not cultivate their virtue or broaden their abilities is due to the word ‘procrastination,’ which delays their entire lives.”

We’ve studied for two or three years. Which of our most serious habits have we changed? If we've changed them, it's called true learning and true practice. If you haven’t changed them, then “no one is perfect, who is without fault? If you can correct them, no goodness is greater.” If you really haven't changed, then we must truly repent. When you go back today, you should light a stick of incense, and then find an auspicious day to publicly confess to your friends and family. Does everyone dare to do it? You must have the courage. First, everyone knows I’m going to change, and that I have no way back. And then, I won’t repeat the mistakes. Second, everyone who hears me will be watching me, and I won't be able to let myself off the hook. I offer this for everyone’s reference.

And if you truly do this confession with a sincere heart, it can move your family. If you truly change, you will be your family's expert in changing. Does everyone have that aspiration? I’m going to become the expert in changing. In fact, becoming a sage or a worthy person is nothing more than having the courage to correct our faults; then we will be in alignment with the sages and worthy people. So, “do not abuse yourself, do not give up on yourself; with practice, you can become a sage or a worthy person.” Today when you go back, light a stick of incense, and then write down three of your most serious habits, things that you most need to change, and make a vow to the ancient sages, the ancestors of all times, to change these mistakes. That would be the greatest good.

That’s all I want to share with everyone today. Thank you. May you all have peace!


Okay, here's the translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, while maintaining the tone of the original speech:

**Lecture 27: Courageously Facing Yourself; Guarding Against the Consequences of Evil Thoughts**

Respected elders and friends, good day to you all! In our last lecture, we discussed that "true goodness is not done for show." Therefore, when we do good deeds, it should stem from a genuine and righteous heart, without seeking any reward, ideally with a mind free from the three concepts. When performing good deeds, the mind should be clear and pure, without a sense of self as the doer, without a focus on the recipient of the good deed, and without dwelling on the things given. With a mind as vast as the universe, one can cultivate great blessings and wisdom. If we perform good deeds with the expectation of recognition or habitually showing off, we deplete the merit of those good deeds. “Good done in public brings worldly fame; hidden virtue is rewarded by heaven.”

Now, let’s move on to:

【**Evil Fears Being Known. This is the Greatest Evil.**】

We must understand that covering up our mistakes allows the evil to grow larger. Think of a levee breaking; it might start with a tiny ant hole, which gradually expands until the entire levee collapses. Great evil often stems from a single misguided thought. Failing to correct ourselves, the evil slowly grows until it is irreversible, and a colossal sin is committed. That's why "he who steals a needle when young will steal gold when grown.” Parents who understand this principle will realize that a child’s first lie or wrong action is a critical moment. “Be cautious at the beginning,” we must be very vigilant.

Mr. Sima Guang, a paragon of virtue, had a life in which nothing he did was concealed. This was due to his early home education. Once, he was peeling walnut skins with his older sister. They were having trouble peeling them, and his sister briefly stepped away. At that moment, a servant passed by, noticed his difficulty, and suggested using hot water, which made peeling much easier. When his sister returned, she asked, "How did you peel them so quickly? That’s a great method, how did you know?" He replied, "I figured it out myself." Thinking back now, I realize that when I was young, I often liked to show off, pretending to have abilities I didn’t possess. But Sima Guang’s father overheard him and reprimanded him, saying, “How can you tell a lie at such a young age?” After that incident, Sima Guang never lied again in his life and dared to be accountable to heaven and earth in all his actions. This shows how parents immediately corrected even a minor error or a wrong thought in their child.

After taking good care of your children, who else should you be taking care of? Yourself. When you can accept the advice of others, they will be more willing to remind you of your mistakes. Recently, a colleague reminded me that when I eat, I sometimes talk to those at the same table. He said that speaking while eating, with food still in your mouth, is not very refined. If you need to respond to someone, it is best to swallow your food, then take a sip of water, otherwise, if you just ate a sesame breadstick, for example, and open your mouth, you might have black flecks all around, which would be quite startling for the others. All this shows consideration for others. We must respect ourselves so that others will respect us. Every action and movement should be dignified. I found his advice very helpful. He reminded me a couple of weeks ago. When he did, I thanked him and said that to repay his care and reminder, I would not repeat that mistake again. If I did, I would accept any punishment he felt was appropriate. This is the spirit of repaying kindness – a small favor is returned with a great one. Someone caring for us, reminding us, goes beyond the grace of a single drop of water, right? How do we repay that? By not allowing their efforts to be wasted. I ask you all, how many people have advised us in our lives? Have we changed? The advice of our parents, teachers, and those who love us, how much have we amended? We cannot not change, otherwise, that would be callous and unrighteous. People who value righteousness cherish the sincerity of others, turning it into a motivating force for themselves.

Why did our teachers achieve such great accomplishments? They never dared forget the teachings of their three teachers. They immediately began practicing as soon as they heard their advice and continued throughout their lives. Master Zhangjia taught him about giving, and so he gave continuously throughout his entire life, receiving extraordinary blessings. He gained wealth by giving; he attained complete wealth. What is complete wealth? It’s not needing money, but having none in your pockets when not needed. Why? Because having a lot of money is heavy, it sways when you walk, and it creates stress. People worry that others will see it, which is uncomfortable. Therefore, a person with complete wealth through giving has no money when it’s not needed. But when money is needed, millions or billions of dollars will come as soon as the thought arises.

Truth can manifest in every person’s life; that’s what makes it truth. Truth that manifests only in some is not true; it is accidental. Therefore, the teachings of the sages are always responsive. If we practice according to these principles, we will surely attract extraordinary opportunities. Mr. Liaofan had no children by fate, but later, his descendants flourished. He transformed his destiny. Moreover, he left us “Liaofan’s Four Lessons,” which have benefitted people for centuries, not just the Chinese, but also the Japanese and Koreans who highly regard this book. Kazuo Inamori, a leading figure in business, recommends “Liaofan’s Four Lessons” as the number one book for young people worldwide.

How do we transform our fate? We should not be afraid to let others know about our wrongdoings; instead, we should openly repent and commit to not making the same mistakes again. The ancients did not cover up their faults; instead, they felt ashamed, strived to improve, and corrected their mistakes. This attitude brought them blessings from heaven. Those who do not change their faults, and are lazy, negligent, and careless will bring misfortune upon themselves. Fortune and misfortune lie in a single thought. Moreover, the ancients were not only cautious when they were among others but also guarded against evil thoughts even when alone. The ancients placed special importance on self-discipline when alone. Just as the classics state, when alone, we should feel that "ten eyes are watching, ten hands are pointing." Even without others present, we should feel as though we are being watched and judged and not give in to our impulses. They would remain cautious and disciplined. How did the ancients live? Every night before going to bed, covered with their blankets, they would reflect on whether they had done anything wrong that day. If they had, they would feel ashamed, even towards their blankets. That was the state of mind of the ancients.

To what extent did the ancients prevent wrongs and stop evil? Even if they had bad dreams, they would repent. During the Ming Dynasty, there was a scholar named Yang Zhu who dreamed he walked into an orchard and picked two plums to eat. The next day, he reflected on his actions and did not eat for several days. If I followed his standard, I might starve to death. My scholarship is far behind his. How did Yang Zhu reflect on his actions? In his dream, he picked two plums without the owner's permission. This showed that he did not distinguish clearly between righteousness and self-interest and had acted unjustly. So, we should not only not be afraid to let others know about our wrongdoings but also deeply repent even for misdeeds only known to ourselves, such as bad dreams. Because we tend to dream what we think about during the day, having bad dreams suggests that our minds are full of chaotic thoughts.

The attitude of the ancients commands our respect. Uncorrected evils, particularly when committed by people in high positions, can cause great harm. From a family perspective, when parents fail to correct their faults, the next generation will suffer and learn bad habits. When a nation's leader fails to correct their wrongdoings, the whole nation's morality deteriorates. “What those above cherish, those below will pursue with more vigor.”

Zeng Gong of the Song Dynasty and Wang Anshi were good friends. Emperor Shenzong asked Zeng Gong for his opinion of Wang Anshi. Zeng Gong replied that Wang Anshi’s writings and character were comparable to those of Yang Xiong of the Han Dynasty, but that he was rather stingy. The Emperor said, “Wang Anshi does not value wealth or status, how can you say that he is stingy?” Zeng Gong clarified, “The ‘stinginess’ I am referring to is that Wang Anshi is very courageous in taking responsibility and working for the country, but he is reluctant to correct his own faults. He does not want to correct his most serious shortcomings.” In truth, it was his pride that held him back.

When an important official is proud and unwilling to correct their faults, they will not listen to the advice of loyal officials. If they don’t listen to loyal officials, who will they listen to? Those who flatter them. As a result, the nation ultimately suffers a great calamity because of him. When Emperor Shenzong heard this, he nodded in agreement. Wang Anshi had the talent to be a prime minister, but because he could not correct his faults, he brought harm to the entire nation, and his reforms have received much criticism in later times. If someone with the talent of a prime minister can have such a negative impact, just because he couldn't change his faults, then how much more likely is it that we, without his talent, and self-righteous to boot, are living in error and wasting our lives away.

Now, let’s look at the next line of scripture. As we discuss these scriptures, we can sense that each line is teaching us to love ourselves and others. To not do good deeds or correct our faults is not self-love. Furthermore, it will bring misfortune upon our descendants. How can a person who does not love themselves love their descendants? “A family that accumulates good will surely have an abundance of blessings; a family that accumulates evil will surely have an abundance of misfortunes.” These scriptures give us a great sense of awareness.

The next line says:

【**Seeing a woman and arousing lustful desires; the retribution comes to your wife and daughters.**】

When we see a woman and have lustful thoughts, we must be aware that just the lustful thought itself, without any action, already diminishes our blessings greatly. Why? Because lust is the root of all evil, and once lustful thoughts arise, all kinds of bad ideas follow. We will look at what kind of thoughts these might be in a moment.

This scripture should shock us, that just a lustful thought can bring harm to our wives and daughters. What if there are inappropriate actions? It would be even more disastrous. Therefore, this “retribution” reminds us that there are consequences for evil actions. We must have a sense of reverence for our words, deeds, and even our thoughts. Why did the ancients say that lust is the root of all evil? Because as soon as lustful thoughts arise, even before the evil circumstances cause evil actions, various fantasies already begin, leading to crafty thoughts about ways to achieve the bad intention, thus setting about to scheme against others. Once a lustful thought arises, other thoughts follow. For example, to reach one’s goal, resentment arises when met with obstacles. When passion is unleashed, attachment grows, and a person becomes obsessed and unable to do anything else but strive to achieve that goal. Then, when they see that another man’s wife is beautiful, they become envious, and then jealous. Throughout history, people have poisoned others out of jealousy. This jealousy leads to attempts to take what belongs to others, and homicidal thoughts arise, along with a complete loss of shame.

This is why the ancients said that lust is the root of all evil. This serves as a kind and compassionate reminder that once we lose our sense of morality, all sorts of evil thoughts and actions will arise, while all good thoughts vanish. So, just the act of having lustful thoughts, even without any physical action, is already accumulating great evil, let alone when actual misdeeds occur.

Let’s look at some concrete examples. A scholar was going to take an exam. He stayed at an inn. The owner of the inn had dreamt the previous night that someone had told him that a scholar would come to his inn and would pass the imperial exam this year, and so he should treat him well. Thus, the destiny to become an official is a great blessing, and it’s the ancestors and many other people protecting you. So, the innkeeper was particularly warm and welcoming to this scholar the next day. The scholar was both anxious and touched. "Why are you treating me so well?" he asked. The innkeeper replied, "I dreamt someone told me that you will pass the exam this year." The scholar, whose family name was Li, was happy. That night, he started to think, "After I pass the exam, I will become a high-ranking official, my wife isn't pretty enough; I should find a new wife." Once this thought entered his head, he became lustful, forgot his duties, and forgot everything for his lust. The next day, he went to take the exam, and the innkeeper had another dream. The person in his dream said, "This scholar is already planning to replace his wife before even passing the exam. This single thought has diminished his good fortune, he will not pass.” And indeed, he failed the exam and returned. The innkeeper told him about the dream, and the scholar was embarrassed that his thoughts had been revealed. He hurriedly left. It is praiseworthy that he still had a sense of shame. A single lustful thought destroyed his entire career.

In Guixi, Jiangxi province, there was another scholar who was highly learned but repeatedly failed his exams. He sought help from a wise master to find the cause of the issue. The master told him that he had been inappropriate toward his aunt. In the past, families were large, and sometimes an aunt was not much older than one’s own age. He said, "No, I have not done anything inappropriate." The master then probed further, asking, "Have you ever even *thought* inappropriate thoughts?” The scholar shamefully admitted, "My aunt is very beautiful; I did have such evil thoughts.” This caused him to lose his chance of success. Therefore, a lustful thought diminishes great blessings and brings retribution upon one’s own career and descendants.

Our next generation suffers greatly in body and mind because of lust, and their future characters are severely affected. With the infiltration of Western culture, the relationship between men and women has become too chaotic. It is essential to instill correct values in our children from a young age. Confucius said, "A gentleman has three things to guard against: in youth, when one's blood and energy have not yet settled, guard against lust." The books and television programs we have at home should all be righteous, with a positive influence, not perverse. The "Standards for Being a Good Student and Child" state, "If it is not a sage's book, put it away; it obscures one's mind and corrupts one's intentions." We didn’t understand these things before and were influenced by movies and books, which were great obstacles to our own learning. Now we are happy to see children studying the classics from a young age, so they don't have to go down the same detours as we did.

Looking at the way the ancients created the character for "lust" 色 (sè), they put "a knife" 刀 (dāo) above it. This creation is very wise. A knife can kill someone, and adultery is very close to murder, even more so in some ways. There is no adultery without murder. For instance, if a woman's husband finds out, he might take his knife and try to kill someone. We have seen reports where husbands became so angry that they not only killed their wives but also killed their wives' parents. This was due to an uncontrollable rage. “How did you raise such a daughter?” And this is the rage against the woman's family. Even jealousy leads two men to fight over a woman, resulting in their deaths. There are many such examples.

When we look at the line "seeing a woman and arousing lustful desires," we are reminded that what is even more frightening in this age is that it’s not just the men who have these issues. Please, women, don't be offended, I am just stating the facts. I read many news reports at one point about women being tricked by men. Why? These men were six foot two or three, often of Western origin, and handsome. These women, maybe they watched too many Hollywood movies, were drawn to the men's good looks. These were managers, and accountants, very successful people from all walks of life. Ultimately, because of lust, they ruined themselves and were defrauded of large sums of money. Later, when the truth came to light, the police discovered that the same man had defrauded multiple women. One woman was summoned to the police station, and when she arrived, she was heavily pregnant, and yet, she was still unaware that the man was a con artist. Therefore, this scripture is a great reminder for people of our times.

Furthermore, adultery turns into murder, and ultimately the law punishes the murderer with death. Even if someone escapes the law, first and foremost, they will suffer from a lifetime of guilt, and they will ruin their health. People who are obsessed with lust always have short lives. They dissipate their vital energy, leading to premature death, and they ultimately destroy themselves. This era is polluted by killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. It's rare to see men die peacefully in their beds. How many people do we hear today who can say "I am going now," and then they are gone? Dying without illness is difficult to find these days. After indulgence, one destroys their own health.

Not only that, but sexual misconduct can lead to deaths and harms to more than just the involved parties. How so? First, it ruins the honor and reputation of one of the people involved, harming them for a lifetime. Second, her in-laws, parents, husband, and children are in deep anguish and will live in shame for their whole lives, as she has brought shame upon the whole family! Some even commit suicide out of shame. Some husbands can't bear it and kill their wives. Some fathers can't bear it and say, "This daughter has brought shame on our entire family," and kill their daughters. Some sons disown their mothers and can't lift their heads among relatives. Good families will never marry into their family. Due to a moment of pleasure, they commit tremendous evils. This eventually results in retribution upon their wives and daughters, and many who commit sexual misconduct will lose their own progeny.

Lust is the root of all evil, and we must be vigilant against it. "No one is a saint or sage; who can be without faults? But to correct one’s mistakes is a great virtue." We didn't understand many of these principles before studying traditional culture. Now that we understand, “The past is as though it died yesterday; the future is as though it is born today." And we must make a vow: not only will we not repeat the mistakes of the past, but we will also do our utmost to advise others not to commit them. With this kind of repentance and a magnanimous attitude, we can quickly cleanse ourselves of our sins. Also, we can use our own past mistakes to guide many others away from making the same errors. This will transform our pain into strength and our troubles into enlightenment. So when we repent and transform our sins, they become virtues.

Alright, we will conclude our discussion here today. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Lecture 28: The Bitter Pain of Indulging in Lust; The Supreme Coolness of Subduing Evil Thoughts**

Respected elders and friends, greetings to you all! As we continue to study the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, we increasingly realize that the fact that the Chinese nation has been able to endure for five thousand years is not accidental. Of all the ancient civilizations in the world, only Chinese civilization has continued to this day. Westerners, very curious about this, conducted a research study before World War II and concluded that it was "possibly because the Chinese emphasize family education." As we study the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, and *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, we are deeply moved. If such excellent teachings could be deeply rooted in our hearts and those of the next generation, many of the chaotic situations in families and society would not exist.

My teacher said, “The root of disaster lies in the problems of the human heart, and the human heart needs to be educated. The East has neglected sage education, and the West has neglected religious education. This is the root cause of unrest.” Therefore, it is impossible to improve things without addressing the problems of the human heart. "Establishing a nation and guiding the people, education is the first priority."

For example, the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* begin with, "Rise at dawn, sweep and clean the courtyard, keeping both inside and outside neat and tidy." This teaches children to be diligent and responsible. What is the problem with children now? They lack responsibility and are lazy. Once a person is lazy, all sorts of evil thoughts will arise. They are ungrateful and take everything for granted. As we delve deeper into these precious family instructions, we can more deeply appreciate that the Chinese nation has five thousand years of educational philosophy, wisdom, experience, and methods, as well as five thousand years of effectiveness, with sages appearing in each generation. Unfortunately, we have neglected this in recent generations, and now it’s difficult to find a filial child. So, what is the biggest crisis? It's the loss of national self-confidence, with the feeling that the moon is brighter in foreign lands. As a result, the chaos that plagues foreign societies is now also found in the Chinese world. Therefore, we must have wisdom and reason to judge what is right and wrong, true and false, and not blindly follow trends.

We are delighted that in mainland China, we now have a wise leader like President Xi who is restoring traditional culture. The entire nation feels that the improvement in the social atmosphere is very rapid. Therefore, what the *Classic of Filial Piety* speaks of is true: “When one person is blessed,” meaning when the national leader has virtue, "the common people rely on him.” Billions of people look up to him and emulate him. Just as grass bends in the wind, those below follow the example of those above. This all gives us confidence. Returning to our own families, when parents take the lead, children will follow suit.

The *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* also mention, “When eating a bowl of porridge or a meal, one should think of how difficult it was to obtain it; when using half a strand of silk or thread, one should always remember how difficult it was to produce.” Many of the current chaotic situations come from extravagance. If children establish this foundation from a young age, they will not be swayed or polluted by society. As we discussed in the previous lesson, "Those who have lustful thoughts upon seeing beauty will receive retribution in their wives and daughters." If children read these scriptures from a young age, and if their parents or elders in the family often tell them stories, these principles and stories about the law of cause and effect, and that good is rewarded and evil is punished, will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When they encounter temptations, their righteous energy will easily arise. If we have not had this kind of influence since childhood, and have even often been exposed to pollution, how can we have self-control when encountering situations? Therefore, a person's self-control and power of observation must be rooted from childhood. From this, we also realize that every sentence in the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* is actually the key to a person's success or failure in life.

Why did Mr. Zhu Bailu write this article? He loved his descendants. Why are we studying this classic now? Is anyone saying that it's just for entertainment? The attitude of learning affects the results of learning. Some people follow trends, thinking, "Everyone is studying classics now, so I'll study them too." When learning, we must know our goals, and we must also make vows. When learning family precepts, we must have ambition, to establish a family tradition that lasts for a thousand years. There is nothing difficult in the world for those who put their heart to it. The descendants of Mr. Zhu Bailu have been passing down these teachings for so long, as have the descendants of Mr. Liao Fan. Their families are still doing well, and Confucius is also our role model.

The more we learn these family instructions, the more we realize what our teachers have been saying: that one word represents Chinese culture—"filial piety." When we come here to learn today, are we practicing filial piety? First, we understand the principles. Not wasting ourselves and not worrying our parents is filial piety. Furthermore, if we educate our children and grandchildren well, and pass down good teachings and the wisdom of life for the benefit of future generations, we will be worthy of our ancestors. When children practice these teachings, they also think of their parents and ancestors. As a saying goes, "When one person achieves the Way, nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven." Future generations are also thinking of their ancestors.

In history, many scholars who made great contributions to the nation were posthumously honored by the emperor, including their parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Some might ask, "The people are already dead, what's the point of honoring them?" Does it have any meaning? It tells the world, how was this pillar of society created? It was through the cultivation of their ancestors that they achieved greatness, and these acts of kindness are not forgotten. Therefore, ancient leaders, when honoring those who had made contributions, also taught people to be grateful and to repay kindness. This also includes honoring whoever had recommended the person in the first place, remembering the source of the water when drinking. Therefore, we understand that filial piety is the core, and when we understand that parents and ancestors love their descendants, reading these scriptures takes on a different meaning.

We, the children of the Chinese nation, are very fortunate. We have not only received the teachings of our own ancestors, but also the teachings of the ancestors of various surnames, generously offered to everyone. Has everyone read the articles by Mr. Fan Zhongyan? They are not only for the descendants of Fan. Everyone has also read the articles by Zeng Guofan. They didn't have "All Rights Reserved" printed on them. Today’s social climate is that of "All Rights Reserved". The ancients would not have done this. First, they had the magnanimity to benefit others. Second, as Confucius said, “I transmit but do not create; I believe in and love the ancients.” These teachings were passed down by sages of all ages, such as Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, King Wen, and the Duke of Zhou. Therefore, not only would they not claim these teachings as their own, but they would feel a sense of mission that as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, they had a responsibility to pass them on.

Let's continue from where we left off in the previous lesson:

**"When seeing beauty, if one gives rise to lustful thoughts, the retribution will fall upon one's wife and daughters."**

This is a profound reminder. Just a single thought can bring disaster upon one's descendants. Once you understand this, you know you can't even allow the thought to arise. How can you allow yourself to have the words and actions? This sentence also has a deeper meaning, telling us that the harm of thoughts is very great. If thoughts are not controlled, they will continue to develop, and that kind of longing, greed, control, and possession will begin to occur continuously. Then, if you don’t get what you want, hatred and jealousy will arise, and may even lead to murder. So many love murders happen now, what is the root cause? It’s that an evil thought was not controlled. Therefore, the ancients emphasized preventing problems before they arise. In a single thought, there is good fortune or disaster. In a single thought, there is the possibility of being a divine being, a human being, or an animal. Therefore, the ancients emphasized controlling thoughts. "Conquering thoughts creates a sage." Wrong thoughts must be cut off decisively, without hesitation, and righteous thoughts must immediately arise so that evil thoughts cannot pollute them.

From this, we are reminded of a very important saying from the ancients: "Of all evils, lust is the greatest; of all virtues, filial piety is the first." This is familiar to everyone. However, many modern films seem to be promoting romantic love and even things that violate ethics and morals. If we are not taught from childhood that these things are wrong, then we see them as correct. Therefore, looking at modern society, the ancient saying "Of all evils, lust is the greatest," shows profound insight, because lust is even more harmful than murder. Lust is close to murder.

First, from oneself, it harms one's own body, which is a form of suicide. Look calmly at the physical condition of our next generation. They have been misguided by too much extravagance and indulgence in killing, stealing, and lust. By indulging in lust, their bodies are ruined. Mr. Lu Dongbin said, “A beautiful maiden of sixteen, her body like butter, wields a sword at her waist, cutting down foolish men. Though no heads are seen to fall, in the darkness, it exhausts one’s bone marrow.” A sixteen-year-old girl has skin like butter, yet she is like a sword hanging at the waist of a foolish man. Although no heads may fall, due to lust, their bone marrow is exhausted. Confucius said, “When young, one’s blood and qi are unstable, and one must be cautious of lust.” Therefore, if a nation's next generation does not refrain from lustful desires, that nation is bound to decline.

Why is lust more dangerous than murder? First, it harms one's own body. Dr. Peng Xin once gave an example of a forty-year-old man whose pulse indicated that his indulgence in lust was too severe. He advised him to abstain from sexual activity for a year. But he didn’t listen, and after six months, his health deteriorated. A year later, he was paralyzed. Traditional Chinese Medicine is very powerful; it looks at the signs and can foresee problems before they arise. Traditional Chinese Medicine has at least five thousand years of experience in healing, so we should listen! “If you don’t heed the advice of elders, you will suffer losses before your eyes.” Traditional Chinese Medicine is also an elder, with five thousand years of history. And the strongest emphasis of Traditional Chinese Medicine is on treating diseases before they arise, not after they have already manifested. This is its great brilliance.

Besides harming oneself, if a woman's husband finds out about her adultery, he may become furious and violent, which can lead to death. He may even hate the wife's parents.

Therefore, adultery can cause suffering for three generations. Because of this lust, we may cause suffering for three generations of another person and their family. This sin is more serious than murder. Her parents are unable to face others, and her children cannot hold their heads high. It's like killing three generations.

During the Ming Dynasty, there was a scholar who went to take the imperial examinations. It so happened that in the inn where he was staying, there was an official's daughter who took a liking to him and showed him great favor. This scholar was very upright and, because it was not proper according to the rites, he refused. But the woman didn’t give up and sent a maid to find him in the middle of the night. This scholar, of course, held onto his righteous thoughts. Another scholar, who was staying in the same inn, became lustful and pretended to be him to meet with this woman. As a result, the next morning, the woman's father returned and, seeing the door open, became furious. The ancients were very intolerant of anything that went against morality. He was also furious at his daughter for doing such a wrong thing. Therefore, when he went inside and saw his daughter with a man, he immediately drew his sword and killed both of them. Therefore, they both went to the capital to take the exams, but one scholar had righteous energy, and later successfully earned a title, while the other couldn’t hold onto the teachings of the sages and was killed. Therefore, the difference between a single thought makes a world of difference. This shows the severity of damaging morality.

Furthermore, adultery can also bring misfortune to one’s descendants. We talked about the twin brothers from Yuzhang. Their voices and appearances were so similar that no one could tell them apart. Their accomplishments, marriages, and births of children all occurred at almost the same time. Relatives and friends all said that their fates were the same. Later, when they went to the capital to take the exams, a woman took a liking to the elder brother. The elder brother turned her down but, knowing that his younger brother looked exactly like him, he advised his brother not to do anything that would go against his conscience, or his future would be in peril. Later, the younger brother couldn't hold on and committed a mistake. Pretending to be his brother, he deceived the woman. As a result, the elder brother passed the exam and was going to advance to the next exam to become a Jinshi. The younger brother was still deceiving the woman and even took a lot of money from her. Later, this woman waited and waited, and finally died of depression. Before her death, she wrote a letter and sent it to the elder brother. When he received it, he realized that his brother had made a terrible mistake. As a result, the elder brother passed the Jinshi exam, and later achieved fame and fortune, and his descendants prospered. The younger brother, not long after, lost his son. Overwhelmed with grief at the loss of his son, he went blind with crying, and he too died soon after. Adultery will lead to the retribution of having no descendants.

From this story, we can understand the principles of nature. A saying advises us, "Do not borrow debts of romance, for you will have to repay them quickly. Your family will have people to repay those debts for you, and they will not let you get away with it." Therefore, “what goes around, comes around.” If you take ill-gotten gains, in the end it will still be lost. If you harm other people’s wives and daughters today, ultimately what comes back is that your own wives and daughters will be harmed. The way of heaven is like a cycle: "Good is rewarded, and evil is punished." And monetary debts are easier to repay, but romantic debts are difficult. This is our reflection on how adultery is close to murder, and how it can bring disaster on one’s descendants.

Furthermore, a serious problem in society today is abortion. Many abortions are related to adultery. There are fifty million abortions in the world each year. Humans, the most intelligent of all living beings, are now killing their own children. Therefore, the teaching that "Of all evils, lust is the greatest," is extremely important for this era. And abortion not only means the death of the child in the womb, but the women herself is in danger of death. Many young women who go for abortions later suffer from excessive blood loss, which is very dangerous. The scriptures also teach us that giving fearless support leads to health and longevity, and that killing one's own children goes against giving fearless support. How can one's health be good if that is the case? Therefore, abortion can lead to one’s own death.

Furthermore, it can lead to infertility. According to scientific statistics, one abortion can severely damage the uterus that nurtures a child, and it reduces fertility by 25 percent. Therefore, the phenomenon we see now is very sad: there are long queues of underage girls waiting for abortions, and on the other side, there are married women seeking medical attention because they can’t conceive. This is a very sad phenomenon. The problem still lies in education, that we don’t know how to love ourselves, to cherish our reputations, and we indulge in desires.

Not only can it lead to death and infertility, but it can also leave behind illnesses. According to statistics, women who have had abortions are three times more likely to develop depression, five times more likely to commit suicide, and three times more likely to die from accidents than women who have not had abortions. Some might say, "What's the connection?" The *Zuo Zhuan* reminds us, "Those who repeatedly do unrighteous things will ultimately destroy themselves." If you do too many things that violate Heaven's principles, of course heaven is going to take you back because we are not behaving like humans. Abortion can attract misfortune. Statistics also show that 80% of women with gynecological diseases have had abortions, which is why their incidence of disease is higher.

It is not only the individual who is affected. In the future, when she becomes pregnant, the child will be difficult to raise and it will affect future generations. It is very easy to understand this scientifically. If we go into the mountains, will the magnetic field of the clean, green mountains and clear waters be good? It will be very good. If we suddenly go to another place where they specialize in killing dogs, will the magnetic field be the same? It will be different. It’s all air, is there a difference? Yes. Does it exist? Yes, it exists. The uterus is a place where life is nurtured, and the magnetic field is very good. But if an abortion is done, the entire magnetic field is changed. Dr. Masaru Emoto's water experiments show us that water has memory. Does our body have memory? Yes, it does. Therefore, it is imaginable how difficult the child will be to raise.

However, in recent generations, education has been lacking. "No one is perfect, who can be without faults? It is a great good to amend one’s errors.” Therefore, as we learn this lesson together today, we each have the responsibility to broadly share these concepts, principles, and examples. Firstly, to make up for the errors in our thinking and behavior, and secondly, so that others don't have to go down the wrong path.

"Of all evils, lust is the greatest." Firstly, because adultery is close to murder. Secondly, because it will destroy one’s own future, it can destroy the accomplishments of one's life. In the example we gave in the last lesson, just by having an evil thought, one’s accomplishments are gone. This shows how harmful thoughts can be. Therefore, changing our thoughts changes our destiny. Mr. Lin Zexu said very profoundly, "If one's intentions are not good, feng shui is of no use." If your heart is not kind, then even if your house has good feng shui, it will not be of any use, and slowly, the feng shui will be broken. A person’s heart and mind should be focused on the welfare of all sentient beings. If we dedicate the merit of our daily scripture reading and good deeds to all sentient beings, this is a very valuable intention. In *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, Mr. Wei Zhongda gives us a good example, “Your one thought is concerned with the welfare of all people.” He was an official and was able to cultivate this merit. Can we do the same? Yes, we can. If we study diligently, and we teach our children well, and in the future, we can promote the learning of the Chinese classics, then our intention in educating our children is to promote the teachings of the sages throughout the world, and then “your one thought” is also focused on the welfare of all people in the world.

Therefore, we must not destroy our own future and must begin by controlling evil thoughts. During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, there was a scholar named Lu Zhongxi. He was very talented, only seventeen years old, and his knowledge was highly admired. He was considered to be a prodigy. He and his teacher Qiu went to the capital. Across from where they were staying, there was a very beautiful woman, and the teacher and student would often steal glances at her. Common people and scholars see things differently. Scholars are people who understand morality, so when they knowingly commit an offense, their sins are doubled. His teacher was even worse because he had an additional offense of misleading his student. His teacher was very confused and even told Lu Zhongxi to go to the City God Temple and ask the City God to bring the two of them together. That very night, the teacher and student dreamed that a deity was scolding them for their disrespectful behavior. In the dream, they also heard that Lu Zhongxi was originally supposed to be the top scholar in the Jiaxu year, with great fortune and prosperity, but because of his greed for women, his thoughts had been disrespectful to the divine, causing great sin. The next day when he woke up, his teacher Qiu had died of cholera, and he himself remained poor and lowly for the rest of his life. This is an example of how not controlling evil thoughts can ruin one's life and destroy one's own future.

Furthermore, from this saying, "Of all evils, lust is the greatest," we can understand the third important point: that it affects society as a whole. When lustful tendencies rise, the divorce rate also increases. Previously, we had never heard of the problem of divorce, but now in large cities, it is as high as 40-50 percent, which is very serious. People do not understand love and righteousness, nor do they understand integrity, nor that they should be true to their partner. It is by indulging in their desires that they incur the high divorce rate. With a high divorce rate, there are more single-parent families and unwed mothers, leading to a decline in the moral standards of the next generation, causing a chain reaction.

Why were the rites and rules between men and women so strict in ancient times? It’s because they were thinking far ahead. Now that these problems have arisen, it is quite difficult to reverse them. Therefore, as the *Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites* says, "To prohibit only after problems have arisen," is "to resist and not to prevail." It’s very difficult to reverse the situation. Therefore, we should focus on prenatal education, which can produce sages. We should focus on the education of children before the age of three, which can produce virtuous people. If we work hard to educate children after the age of three, we can produce gentlemen. Thus, the *Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites* speaks about the timing of education, "To prohibit before the problem arises is called precaution."

One of our colleagues felt that prenatal education had a great influence. When she was pregnant, she would often say to her child, "My child, it is morning now," or, "My child, it is night now, it's time to go to sleep," and communicate with him like this. As a result, after the child was born, his life was very regular. He would sleep when it was time to sleep. This proves the power of prenatal education. This is the positive side. She also reflected on the fact that she was often angry during her pregnancy, so her child also has a bad temper. So, he learned both the good and the bad.

These principles of the ancients truly have great meaning for us. In the thinking of the ancients, as long as the divorce rate was high, the functions of the family would decline. Children without good environments would naturally have a decline in their moral standards. And if the crime rate is high, the entire society will become unstable. Therefore, we all have a responsibility for the social atmosphere, and we must not only think of ourselves. If we have a harmonious marriage, we can be a good example for society. Divorce, on the other hand, affects the social atmosphere.

As *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* says, "Consider not the current act, but the long-term consequences; consider not the present moment, but the long-term effects; consider not the individual, but the whole world." Therefore, for thousands of years, women's clothing has been very dignified. Now, as we see in Malaysia, women in their eighties are dressed very elegantly. Just looking at them makes us have a sense of respect. "Respecting yourself will make others respect you; honoring yourself will make others honor you." These older women, even in front of their own children, are so dignified and not casual. If we don't have this attitude or sensitivity, and we act differently in front of others than when we are alone, what will the child learn? That it's okay to be casual when no one is watching. Then, how can they develop the ability to be disciplined in their solitary moments? I know a principal who is full of “educational love.” He has taught many students, and they often come back to visit him. He said that it was his student who introduced him to *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*. When he reflected on his childhood, his mother, in his memory, was always very dignified and never sloppy. A mother’s behavior is constantly influencing her children. Therefore, what you wear will influence children and affect the social atmosphere.

If women today understood these principles, they would also focus on dressing appropriately. If they wear revealing clothes, it will cause lustful thoughts in others. Whenever you cause others to have bad thoughts or behaviors, this is creating bad karma. We value our deportment and are dignified. The people who see us will be influenced by our example. This is accumulating merit and virtue.

Therefore, do not underestimate your words and actions. They can affect your family and society.



Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**Book Translation:**

It is essential that all human interactions, including conversations, employ correct and righteous language. Such speech should inspire confidence and wisdom, rather than resorting to improper or wicked words that lead others into evil thoughts or even incite them to commit wrongdoing. The karmic consequences of such actions are severe. Without constant reminders, it is easy to be swept along by negative trends. Furthermore, the prevalence of frivolous talk, even within public institutions and the educational system, only amplifies the gravity of the offense. The educational sector, responsible for cultivating future generations, should be particularly wary of corrupting students with evil ideas—this is a serious transgression. Public servants, as representatives of the nation, must be especially mindful of their image.

The media and books also have a profound impact on society. Good content creates immeasurable merit; bad content, on the other hand, should be approached with critical awareness. Those who create pornographic films face dire consequences. Likewise, many figures in the entertainment industry who promote sexual immorality often meet untimely ends. With careful observation, the truth is readily apparent before our eyes.

Consider the novel *Water Margin*, written by Shi Nai’an. Its excessive violence and sexual content are believed to have resulted in his sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons all being mute. This karmic consequence is a clear warning. Therefore, all literature and art should be measured against the standards of the sages. Even famous works can still damage the soul if they lack righteousness and proper understanding. *The Romance of the Western Chamber*, penned by Wang Shifu, is filled with stories of illicit relationships, and it’s said that Wang would often bite his own tongue before his death. These consequences manifest quickly due to the widespread and lasting impact of such works. When will he be free from negative karma? Only when the book disappears entirely will his karma cease to accumulate. This underscores how profoundly the ancients considered the implications of their actions.

Analyzing it this way, the saying "Of all evils, lust is the chief" is truly insightful. Even more significantly, rampant sexual immorality can lead to the downfall of entire nations. The Shang Dynasty’s King Zhou’s infatuation with Daji and the Zhou Dynasty’s King You’s obsession with Baosi both led to the collapse of their respective kingdoms. When Confucius governed the State of Lu, serving as both chief justice and prime minister, Lu flourished. However, the State of Qi, envious and fearful of Lu’s growing strength, sent a troupe of performing courtesans to the ruler of Lu, Duke Ding. Unable to resist the temptation of female beauty, Duke Ding did not heed the sage, and Confucius was left with no choice but to leave and wander the various kingdoms in search of a wise leader who would uphold proper rites and music. This illustrates how the obsession with female beauty can be so destructive as to ruin a nation.

Political corruption is also deeply linked to the allure of women. Lust is frequently associated with greed, drugs, and a host of other evils. We should deeply contemplate the wisdom left to us by the ancients, so we may grasp its profound meaning.

The karmic consequences of sexual misconduct are dreadful, while the consequences of resisting it are extraordinarily auspicious. As we know, "Five Blessings Descend on the Home," and three of these blessings can be attained by abstaining from lust: longevity, health, and a peaceful death without illness. Today, most people approach death in a state of unconsciousness, which is often related to a life of indulgence.

In Xinzhou, Jiangxi, there was a scholar named Lin Maoxian who was recommended to take the imperial examination. One night, a woman from next door came to his residence. He sternly reprimanded her, declaring, "Men and women must maintain their proper roles, as prescribed by ritual. Moreover, the gods watch from above." People often err due to a single misguided thought; however, with a reminder, their inherent goodness can guide them back on the right path. This woman, upon being reminded by Lin Maoxian, felt ashamed and left. The following year, Lin Maoxian passed the imperial exam, and all three of his sons also became successful scholars. Thus, by abstaining from lust, one's own life and that of one’s descendants can prosper. Should we investigate further, we might find that countless more scholars emerged from his lineage. A virtuous family is truly a source of talent.

In a region of Guangdong, a family produced over one hundred scholars. Their buildings were inspiring to behold, and their collection of paintings and calligraphy were all filled with educational significance. Thus, the architecture, paintings, and every decoration in their home served an educational purpose. Upon seeing such places, and recalling the teachers’ words that “the Chinese have five thousand years of educational wisdom,” we understand it to be true.

In Fujian, there was a scholar named Zhang Wenqi who, along with a friend surnamed Zhou, fled to the mountains to escape bandits raiding their village. In a cave, they encountered a beautiful woman who was about to leave upon seeing the two men— women in those days were very mindful of propriety. Immediately, Zhang Wenqi reassured the woman: “It is dangerous for you to leave now, as you might encounter bandits. We are honest men; have no fear.” Late that night, Zhou began to succumb to lustful thoughts. Zhang Wenqi repeatedly stopped his friend, thus protecting the woman. At daybreak, Zhang cleverly led his friend out of the cave, saying: “Let’s go down and assess the situation.” It shows that this scholar was always vigilant, paying attention to such details to prevent accidents and to get his friend away from the situation. Later, he found some elders of the village and learned the woman’s family, and had her sent home promptly. Soon after, a man named Huang came to discuss a marriage with Zhang Wenqi, bringing a generous dowry. He learned that the woman was the very same one they had sheltered in the cave. This shows that marriage is often predetermined, and had they committed an improper act, they would have ultimately harmed themselves. But, because Zhang Wenqi was virtuous, he found a good marriage. Later, both of his sons became successful scholars. This illustrates the auspicious karmic consequences of abstaining from lust.

We must deeply understand the importance of restraining evil thoughts and maintaining our righteous thoughts and actions. How then can we effectively counter such temptations? Many scholars and spiritual practitioners throughout history have struggled with this, so we must exert great effort in facing temptations. First and foremost, we must cultivate reason, not be guided by emotion. *The Treatise on Actions and Retributions, Amplified* provides a wealth of guidance that can enlighten our minds. The book mentions that fleeting desires are actually easily dispelled. In *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, it says, "When righteous thoughts are present, evil thoughts cannot take hold." Just considering that by not restraining lustful thoughts, we risk ruining our centuries-old reputation, our lifelong potential, the merits accumulated by our ancestors, and even the fortunes of our descendants, is often enough to stop a fleeting desire.

Gao Zongxian of the Ming Dynasty used the analogy: “Our body is like white jade.” He said that we must protect our virtue like we hold onto white jade, with caution and reverence, because one misstep can cause irreparable damage. “This matter is like poison.” Immoral behavior is like poison; one sip, and your life may be ruined.

Therefore, we must build a foundation of such rational understanding. In practical terms, we must first recognize that evil thoughts are illusory, not real. Wang Longxi, a Ming Dynasty scholar known for his skillful and insightful teaching, was once asked how to tame lustful desires. He asked the questioner, “Imagine a famous courtesan in her private chamber. When you enter, you feel an urge, but then upon pulling back her curtain, you find your own sister or daughter there. Would your lustful desire remain?” The lustful heart is instantly extinguished. How can it be real? Therefore, not only is lustful thought false, but all evil thoughts are false. By recognizing their falsity, our righteous thoughts can prevail, and evil can no longer corrupt us. To take it seriously is like leading wolves into your home or treating a thief as your father. It’s to give power to something that is unreal. However, like a thief that enters your home, with a swift slap of the table, showing great righteousness, he will cower and not dare to misbehave. This is why the ancients stressed the importance of self-cultivation even in solitude: to maintain righteous thoughts and energy at all times.

A second method is to practice "Do not look at what is improper." We must avoid any situation, film, book, or place that might incite evil thoughts. This is self-preservation, to not blind ourselves to our innate goodness, and to not violate propriety. Propriety is a way to respect oneself and others. Indulging in evil desires degrades ourselves, and so we must learn to love ourselves first.

Third, *The Sutra of Forty-Two Sections* teaches us how to counter evil thoughts from a Buddhist perspective. The Sutra says, “Regard the elderly as your mother,” thus preventing evil thoughts. “Regard those older than you as your elder sister.” “Regard those younger than you as your younger sister.” And “Regard those of a younger generation as your daughter.” When these thoughts arise, evil thoughts cannot enter. These methods and teachings, from the sages and our ancestors, demonstrate great compassion, patiently and repeatedly reminding us.

Another method is “meditation on impurity,” the fourth method we will discuss. We are familiar with Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism, and his teaching, “The Ode to the Leathery Sack.” A “leathery sack” refers to the human body, which is merely a layer of skin over an impure interior. The “Ode to the Leathery Sack” describes the body as a "channel of urine and feces," constantly discharging toxins. It is a place of "accumulated pus and blood," and asks, “Where is there any romance in this?” To illustrate, imagine a flower vase filled with putrid excrement. If this were given to us, would we accept it? Therefore, we must not be greedy for the body. Our bodies, through its seven orifices, constantly excrete unclean substances.

Di Renjie, a famous prime minister of the Tang Dynasty, often used the "meditation on impurity" to overcome his own desires and cultivate great blessings. He said that when facing beauty, imagine: "In a few days, if this woman were to die suddenly, her body would decompose and become infested with maggots, emitting a foul odor." The smell of animal corpses is repulsive, and the smell of a human body is likely worse. However, many who cultivate well become fragrant, and we've heard of how Master Hsu Yun never bathed but his clothes were always fragrant. This should make us ashamed and urge us to exert more effort. Di Renjie would imagine a woman, no matter how beautiful, as something that would decay and become repulsive, and the evil thoughts would vanish. Practicing the meditation on impurity requires wisdom.

The fifth method is found in *The Method of Abstaining from Lust.* It says, “When others tempt me, it leads to ‘death and ruin’,” causing one to lose their life and wreck their family. “It shortens my lifespan and depletes my fortune.” They are “things that harm my life.” We must see them as a sharp blade meant to kill us and our family. Therefore, the evil thought disappears. See them as “tigers and wolves” who wish to devour you, as “poisonous snakes,” or as “ghosts sent to claim my soul.” See them as “vengeful enemies from a previous life” who wish to destroy my entire family. When we view them in this light, the evil thought disappears. Sixth, the “Ten Admonitions by Wenchang Dijun” also provide guidance. It is clear how our ancestors repeatedly urged us to see "Lust as the source of all evil." We must cherish their teachings. "Do not think about what you have not seen." Before encountering the temptation of beauty, do not entertain such thoughts. Instead, contemplate the virtues of the sages and read scriptures to maintain righteous awareness. When encountering a temptation, it is best to have already prepared oneself. Those who have an abundance of idle thoughts and desires will crumble when facing temptation. Thus, "Do not think of what you have not seen," “When you see it, do not be disturbed,” and “After seeing it, do not dwell on it in your mind.” It is crucial to work on one's thoughts. It is best to avoid idle thinking and to spend time reading and listening to sacred texts to maintain righteousness.

Seventh, a scholar suggested that when an evil thought arises, hold your hand over fire until it hurts, and your attention will be diverted to the pain. Then, think that if the thought is not turned around, the results will be far more painful than fire. If you still cannot control your thoughts, imagine yourself in your grave. Those who are buried in the grave were once living as you are. All will ultimately end up in the grave, so why indulge in desires now?

When we consider death, that we will take all our good and evil with us, then we will not act recklessly. Thus, the word “death” is powerful, as it can help control any wicked thought. Put the word “death” on your forehead and constantly remind yourself that life is impermanent. Why would you still let yourself be overcome with evil thoughts? Master Yin Guang, a prominent Buddhist monk, often reminded people to contemplate the impermanence of life, as it makes it easier to maintain righteousness.

Eighth, remember that there are gods watching from above, so do not commit evil deeds in secret. “The eyes of the gods are like lightning.” If people thought about being seen by heaven, gods, ghosts, and all people, they would not dare to act wickedly. They would be more vigilant.

Ninth, Confucius taught, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," and to practice empathy. If we act lustfully towards others' wives and daughters, how would we feel if others treated our wives and daughters the same way? I remember once, my sworn brother attended an event where some young girls were performing on stage in revealing outfits, and the people around them were watching with excitement. My brother then said, “If these girls were your daughters, would you still find this pleasing?” Instantly the people realized, “Oh, yes. It is pleasant to look at other people's daughters but what if it were my own?” Therefore, change your thinking; "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.”

These are some of the many methods, and all are insightful. You can further explore *The Treatise on Actions and Retributions, Amplified*, *An Shi’s Complete Works*, *A Comprehensive Account of Historical Retribution*, *The Precious Mirror of Longevity and Health*, and *Repenting of the Sea of Desire*. These books provide detailed explanations and accounts of karmic consequences, which we should try to understand and absorb. Our ancestors painstakingly compiled these invaluable books.

“When lust is aroused, retribution falls upon one’s own wife and daughters; when resentment is concealed, misfortune extends to one's descendants.” This saying embodies the deep concern our culture has always had for future generations and demonstrates a sense of responsibility. I will stop here today, and we can discuss “when resentment is concealed, misfortune extends to one's descendants” next time. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining the original tone:

**Lecture 29: A Wonderful Life with Humanity and Integrity**

Esteemed elders and friends, hello! In our last session, we studied the passage: “One who sees beauty and allows lust to arise will be repaid through his wife and daughters.” Today, we’ll discuss the next line:

【To harbor resentment and use hidden arrows, misfortune will extend to one's descendants.】

These two lines of scripture make us realize that we are an inseparable whole with our ancestors and descendants. “A family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings,” as seen in the flourishing of Confucius’s descendants for over 2,500 years, all thanks to the blessings of their ancestors. The *Book of Changes* also states, “A family that accumulates evil will surely have abundant misfortune.” I believe no one wishes to bring misfortune to their descendants, but often because they don’t understand the principles, they follow their own habits, creating sin that harms themselves and their children.

The *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* state, “Though children may be foolish, they must not neglect reading the classics.” A lack of understanding of principles is the greatest calamity in life because it leads to a lack of self-love and a lack of love for others. Just like this scripture, "To harbor resentment and use hidden arrows, misfortune will extend to one's descendants.” "Harboring" means keeping something in your heart. What is kept in the heart? Resentment. Isn't such a person in constant pain? So where is the foolishness of a person? It is in the self-abuse. They could have been sages, but instead, they cling to resentment and suffer every day. People need to learn from the classics to gain wisdom, to avoid doing harm to themselves and others. Instead, they should do things that benefit themselves and others, and love themselves and others. The use of "hidden arrows" often involves scheming and seeking revenge.

In Buddhism, the first sight upon entering a temple is the Laughing Buddha, with a large belly that can accommodate all, and a smile that is always radiant. This signifies the ability to embrace all and equally love and care for everyone. The appearance comes from the heart; only with such a heart can one have such a dignified countenance. Let’s imagine, if someone "harbors resentment and uses hidden arrows," what would they look like? A small nose and small eyes, constantly scheming against others, a deeply furrowed brow; they might even accidentally squash a fly to death. Sometimes, people need to become observers, to step back and look at themselves when facing troubles in interpersonal relationships. Suddenly, they need to calm down and see their own current state: "Oh my, why am I doing this? Why am I following these bad habits?" So, we should change our thoughts and change our attitude toward life. If we can change, first, we must understand the principles, and then our hearts will be at peace.

Our ancestors left behind many good teachings: "Every day is a good day, every moment is a good moment, everyone is a good person, and everything is a good thing.” Do we believe this? Why do we first ask if we believe it? For our goodness to grow, faith is the foundation. If we do not believe, we won't act accordingly. Only by acting accordingly can we gain a deeper understanding and feel the truth. If we don’t believe, we’ll continue with our worries and flawed thinking, remaining the same. Now, let us believe that this teaching is good, that it has been passed down for thousands of years and should not deceive us. How do we live each day as if everyone is a good person? How do we live each day as if everything is a good thing when it feels like everything is going wrong, and it seems like everyone has wronged us? Why is there such a big difference from these scriptural sayings?

We have previously studied *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* explains many of life's philosophies very clearly. Applying it to this particular line, a person should not “harbor resentment;” do not keep resentment in your heart. What should resentment be transformed into? A heart of gratitude. Some might say, "He is not good to me; should I be grateful to him?" *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says, “Those who have no fault but are unjustly defamed will often see their descendants suddenly flourish.” He has wronged me. I have done no wrong, yet I am defamed and insulted; my descendants will flourish. “A family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings.” If our descendants flourish, our own blessings are even greater. Therefore, those who defame us are actually sending blessings to us and our descendants. So, is defamation a good thing or a bad thing? Therefore, understanding the principles is very important. If we understand the principles, we will not suffer. If we don't understand the principles, we will get stuck in our own thinking, agonizing until we're spitting blood, and no one will pity us. Why? Because we learn but do not act accordingly, bringing suffering upon ourselves.

Therefore, everything being a good thing is the truth. By changing our perspective, a crisis becomes an opportunity, and troubles become enlightenment. So who has good fortune? Those who listen to the sages and ancestors are blessed; they immediately find peace and will not suffer. What about those who don’t listen? As the saying reminds us, “If you don’t listen to the elders, you'll suffer before your eyes.”

The *Standards for Being a Good Student* also contains the teaching that “everything is a good thing”: “When you see someone do good, think about emulating them,” and “when you see someone do bad, reflect on yourself.” It also teaches us. So, when we encounter an evil person, we are also increasing our virtue; we should not commit the same mistakes he does. When we encounter evil people, it increases our cultivation; how could we suffer? How could we be in conflict with them? How could we be so angry we grit our teeth? Therefore, all suffering is self-inflicted; we cannot blame others. This is called “reverse endurance;” endurance can control resentment and anger. Reverse endurance means to reflect on ourselves and observe ourselves.

There is also compassionate endurance. If our compassion is strong enough, when we see a person who, as one of the "three powers of heaven, earth, and humanity," is still creating evil karma, we will not only not get angry, but we will feel pity for them. As a Chinese, they have not learned the wisdom of 5,000 years and are still harming themselves and others; isn't that unjust? So we feel pity, not conflict.

Another type is joyful endurance; when others wrong us, we are still able to be happy. Why? Because they are giving us blessings. Also, they are giving us a test to see if our cultivation is sufficient. So, what kind of mindset do we have? We see everyone as our teacher, and we are just the student. Why would we complain about our teachers? Teachers are here to help us succeed, to see if our cultivation is sufficient, if we can pass the test. So, we will not get angry and will not harbor resentment against those who test us or treat us poorly. When we can feel that everyone is here to help us succeed, then won't everyone be a good person? Therefore, after learning this teaching, we should remind ourselves not to make life difficult for ourselves when we could be living well.

If we know how to interact with others with such a broad mind, the next generation will definitely be optimistic. When those around us gradually come into contact with us, they will also feel that our way of life is better. Gradually, we cultivate ourselves, and then the family is harmonized. After the family is harmonized, the state is well-governed. In this life, we should strive to transform others by cultivating ourselves, thereby achieving great value. Looking at *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, the entire piece discusses how to manage a family, but each line discusses self-cultivation. This shows that self-cultivation is fundamental.

History is a mirror that gives us great lessons: good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil. During the Song Dynasty, there was a famous chancellor named Wang Dan. He was selfless and wholeheartedly served the country. There was an official named Lu, who one day came to Wang Dan with 100 taels of gold, hoping to use this bribe to get promoted. Wang Dan, being very upright, told him that important positions could not be attained through such means, that private gain should not override public duty, and he refused him. As a result, Lu harbored resentment and cursed Wang Dan every day, wishing him a quick death. There's a saying, "What goes out will come back to you." When he used curses to harm others, what happened to the negative energy? It returned to himself. So hitting someone is like hitting yourself, and cursing someone is like cursing yourself. If you hit someone today, they will remember, and they will seek revenge sooner or later. Therefore, a rational person would never do anything harmful to others because harming others will come back to harm themselves and their descendants. Not long after Lu cursed Wang Dan, a deity appeared in his dreams and rebuked him, saying, "How could you treat such a loyal and patriotic man with such malice?” After he woke up, he died within a few days. This was the consequence of harboring resentment and cursing others.

During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, there was a prime minister named Li Linfu. There is an idiom to describe him: "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted." His words were sweet and he seemed to be very complimentary, but in his heart, he hid a dagger, secretly plotting against others. This idiom refers to Li Linfu. The idioms left behind by our ancestors all have historical origins, and this is indeed a culture with a long history. History is like a mirror, reminding us. Because Li Linfu was a member of the imperial family, related to the emperor, and particularly good at flattering, he quickly rose to the position of prime minister. Afraid that his power would be threatened, he became jealous and hateful toward those with virtue and talent, and plotted against them. Later, because he accumulated too much evil, an official accused him of over 20 crimes, all serious. This official was very upright; Li Linfu was harming the country and its people. Sometimes, scholars will risk their lives to expose evil people. However, Li Linfu did not reflect on his actions, and instead, falsely accused the official, eventually having him beaten to death. Later, Li Linfu's evil deeds reached their peak, and he died with blood flowing from his seven orifices. After his death, because he had a feud with Yang Guozhong when he was alive, Yang Guozhong instigated An Lushan to accuse Li Linfu of treason. The crime of treason was very serious. As a result, the emperor ordered that his corpse be exhumed and dismembered. All his family members were exiled to remote borders, "misfortune extended to his descendants." So this is the eventual consequence of being "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted."

Our ancestors reminded us to be kind and generous to others, for a large heart leads to great blessings. Do not be petty. Not only does traditional Chinese culture teach its children this, so does the Islamic faith. As the saying goes, "Great minds think alike." The wise people of both East and West, having attained understanding of the universe, life, and the truth of the heavens and earth, know how people should behave. Previously, we mentioned the Islamic Hadith which states: "Speak justly in days of anger and joy.” People should never act impulsively. "Reconnect with those who have cut ties with me." Even if they sever their relationship with us, we should still be harmonious with them, providing support and help. This is true kindness. "Take care of those who are indifferent to me." This reminds us that if people become indifferent, it must be because there was a previous relationship. In the end, misunderstandings or other incidents may lead to such a result. So, if we remember past kindness and let go of unpleasantness, broken mirrors can be pieced back together and conflicts can be resolved. As the saying goes, "It is better to resolve conflicts than to create them," and "When will vengeance end?" It is important to be open-minded and not make things difficult for ourselves in this life or even the next.

In Pingyang Township, located at the border of Hunan and Guangxi provinces, the population is not very large. However, more than one hundred people remember their past lives. We have seen TV shows about "reincarnated people." It's already special when one or two people remember, but in this township, more than a hundred people remember. They remember their past homes, past languages, past relatives and friends; it’s very unique. Some even remember who owed them money from a past life. So, there is no such thing as taking advantage or being at a disadvantage. Debts are owed and must be paid. Therefore, those who understand the principles no longer hold grudges or take advantage of others. Many scientists in the West also use scientific methods to prove that there is an afterlife. This makes it even clearer that we cannot hold grudges; it is a never-ending cycle. Once a grudge is held, repayment is never exact; it becomes increasingly fierce. We see that people today have huge tempers and will resort to violence over the smallest things. It's very dangerous.

So, the Islamic Hadith is very good. If we interact with others with such broad minds, there will be harmony, and even the greatest grudges can be resolved. "Take care of those who are indifferent to me.” "Forgive those who treat me unjustly.” If they are unjust to me, can I be unjust to them? If they are unjust to me, and I am unjust to them, the sin is compounded. Why? Because we have read the words of the sages, and they have not. If they have not read it, and I still argue with them, then I have no magnanimity. So “the ancestors were not good,” their parents and grandparents for generations did not learn. If they haven't learned it, and I still argue with them, then what did I learn? "Those who were not taught cannot be blamed." We should teach through our own good actions, and influence them to have faith in the classics of the sages. That is the right thing to do. We need to transform and convert, turn enemies into friends and resentments into kinship. When studying the teachings of the sages, we should cultivate such broad minds and abilities.

Resentment has a source. Have you ever seen someone who never harbors resentment? In history, we see that King Shun never held resentment, even when his parents wanted to harm him, he reflected on himself. So, if a person harbors resentment toward others, the root cause might be that they already harbor resentment toward their parents. If we do not remove the root of a weed, it will grow back in the spring. Similarly, any bad habits in our behavior could stem from our incorrect attitude toward our parents.

The *Classic of Filial Piety* tells us, "Those who love their parents dare not dislike others; those who respect their parents dare not be arrogant towards others." Thus, "to be close to those we are related to" means to love our parents, and by extension, to love all people. “Cherish relatives and then show kindness to the people, and show kindness to the people and then show compassion to all things." This extends from loving all people to showing compassion to all forms of life. It is a natural extension of compassion and love from filial piety. If we cannot be compassionate and loving, the root lies in the lack of filial piety. If we truly practice filial piety well, many bad habits can be corrected. Do not underestimate "entering the home, be filial." Within this short passage, we find the cure for all our worldly problems.

"When parents dislike me, then is filial piety demonstrated," if our parents misunderstand us, we should still be sincere in our filial piety without any resentment. Cultivation is built on this. If we have troubles we cannot overcome, we should repeat “entering the home, be filial” several times. We should find the solution.

Let us look at the next line:

【When the household is harmonious, even if meals are scarce, there is still abundant joy. When the state tax is completed early, even if there is nothing left in the purse, there is still the greatest pleasure.】

The final two words of these two lines are "joy" and "pleasure". Everyone is pursuing a happy life. I don't think you have ever met relatives or friends who said that they work so hard every day just to make themselves more miserable. I think there is no such person. However, let's think calmly. From ourselves to those in our lives, day after day, year after year, 2014 has passed, it's so fast! I remember when I was in elementary school, it felt like a year passed so slowly, and when would I receive the New Year's money! Now, in middle age, it feels like a year goes by so quickly. So the scientists and the classics both say that time is an illusion, and it makes sense. Everyone's experience is different; it is not real, but time is precious. As we go through each year, each day, do we truly become happier? According to scientists, people laugh less and less as they age. So these two sentences are very important. Hard work may have results, but it doesn't guarantee good results. If we get our direction wrong, if we get our goal wrong, and that goal is one that makes us more miserable, then no matter how hard we work, we will still be miserable. For example, the so-called pleasure people pursue nowadays is chasing desires, which is destined to make us increasingly miserable. Because the ancients said, desire is an abyss. It can only draw you deeper and deeper, so how can one be happy? They work hard every day to earn money, but it is never enough. Now the next generation is very good at spending money and cannot save it, because they are too extravagant and indulgent. "It is difficult to go from extravagance to frugality," it is very difficult to become frugal again. These two sentences are very important, they determine if our goals are correct, and if our lives are becoming more fulfilling and joyful.

The first line says, “When the household is harmonious,” the whole family is harmonious; the elders are kind, the younger ones know how to be obedient and respectful, and the entire family is full of harmony. Even if “meals are scarce,” the meal is not very abundant or well-prepared. But there is “still abundant joy.” Although material enjoyment is not great, the spirit, the harmony, and the family atmosphere are such that everyone’s growth and life are very happy. In fact, we in the past two or three generations have experienced this. Thirty years ago, material life was not so good, right? Let me ask, were people's smiles brighter thirty years ago or now? Also, was the father-son relationship more harmonious thirty years ago than now? The feelings between siblings thirty years ago are different compared to now. But now, people have better material comforts. As a result of better material comforts, siblings are fighting in court over property; there are constant conflicts. Where is there any abundance of joy? Because people's greed is growing more and more. In the past, people lacked material things, they valued their blessings, and they never forgot the help they received from relatives and friends, they were grateful. Sometimes the family was not very wealthy. When they bought one popsicle, six or seven siblings each took a bite. That taste is still remembered after thirty years, right? Now children will eat three or four popsicles, and then say “Okay, don’t eat it anymore; it’s not tasty!” They complain about it. So whether the heart is happy or not has no absolute connection to whether material goods are abundant or not; what determines this? The heart does. So these two sentences remind us what the true happiness in life is. If people do not think through these principles, with the rise of utilitarianism, it is not easy to not follow the current trend or follow incorrect ideologies and values. Only if you are truly calm and clear-headed can you avoid being tainted.

Mencius tells us that "the noble person has three joys." The first joy is "the parents are living and the siblings are without troubles,” meaning that we have parents to care for, the siblings are all long-lived, together with the children and grandchildren, everyone is happy, you can reminisce about childhood from fifty or sixty years ago. This is family harmony; it is consistent with our inherent nature. The second joy is "looking up, not ashamed of heaven; looking down, not ashamed of people," meaning that we feel we haven't wronged heaven or others, our conscience is clear, we eat well, and we sleep well; this is the pleasure of life. Nowadays, people cannot eat or sleep well, they have to take sleeping pills and see psychiatrists; this is very painful. The third joy is "obtaining the world's talents and educating them," helping others succeed, and contributing to the success of groups, the country, and the nation, this is the third joy. In *Zhu Zi's* later works, he said "studying should be for becoming a sage, not just to pass examinations; serving as an official should be for the benefit of the monarch and the country, not for personal gain." Those who are officials or in high positions should not only think about their own happiness. More importantly, they should achieve self-success, help others achieve success, and help the country to find and train talent. The most important thing for contributing to a group is also to find and train talent, as talent can accomplish great things.

We know that family harmony is a joy, so how can we create a harmonious family atmosphere? As the saying goes, "A harmonious family prospers in everything," and "harmony creates wealth." A harmonious family will attract good opportunities, whether it is in marriage or in career. It will attract good things. So, "having virtue will bring people, and having people will bring land." The principle of attraction is very important, right? If there are quarrels every day, will that attract good business partners? Will it attract good opportunities? It's very difficult.

How can we achieve family harmony? Many Chinese words provide us with insight: “peace,” “love,” “respect,” “modesty,” and “humility.” These words are put together for a reason. How do we achieve harmony? Equality creates harmony; if we treat people unequally, they will harbor resentment. How can there be harmony? Chinese characters are very meaningful. It is just like how a country should treat all ethnic groups and religions equally; only then will there be harmony. If there is inequality, conflicts will arise. As the saying goes, “Injustice will cause an outcry.” If something is unfair, people will complain and protest.

Zheng Lian of the Ming Dynasty had a large family of over a thousand people. There is a story called "Zheng Lian Breaks the Pears". He was the head of the family, leading a large family of more than a thousand people, but they were very harmonious. We need to understand the wisdom within this. Nowadays, a small family of three or four people often quarrels, but he was able to make a family of over a thousand people harmonious. The emperor, seeing how harmonious his large family was, admired him and gifted him two pears. It was probably also a test. "I want to see how you will divide two pears". Those who lack magnanimity will quickly sneak back home, call their own children into the room, and stand guard at the door: “Quick, eat it before anyone sees you!” But Zheng Lian was very composed when he returned home. He ordered two of the biggest water vats to be brought out, filled them with water, and then put one pear in each vat, smashing them so the pear juice would mix into the water. Then over a thousand people each drank a bowl, very fair and equal. Let’s think about it, the relatives who were not closely related to Zheng Lian were very moved. “The elder treats us all the same.” What did his own children learn? They learned that when in a group, they should not discriminate, but treat everyone the same, with care and attention. In fact, you should be stricter with those who are closer to you, because the relationship is close and they will not break ties or break up with you. At the same time, they were also being taught that when others have needs, they should be selfless and have this kind of broad mindedness. Therefore, this is equal treatment. Zheng Lian is a good example.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I have aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow, while also retaining the nuances of the original text.

**Harmony and Love**

“Harmony with love” means showing love and compassion, especially when family members and relatives face difficulties. We should not reject or abandon them but offer them warmth. This will lead to harmony within the family. “Harmony with respect” means being respectful and avoiding arrogance. We should not look down upon family members because of their education, appearance, income, or social status. This is unacceptable. We must respect and be grateful for them. We should also cultivate “harmony with humility.” Humility gives off a sense of peace and encourages us to praise and affirm others. This is how we achieve harmony.

The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (弟子規) contains a very important teaching that is closely and directly related to “family harmony”: “Value material possessions lightly, and resentment will not arise; control your speech, and anger will naturally disappear.” This will dissipate anger and resentment. If we think carefully, most family conflicts and disputes seem to be related to material possessions and speech. Therefore, if these two teachings are put into practice, we will not be far from “family harmony.”

During the Song Dynasty, there was a woman named Cui Shaodi. She was going to marry into the Su family, which consisted of five brothers. The first four brothers were already married, and their wives had very bad tempers, often quarreling and sometimes even fighting. When Cui Shaodi was about to marry into the Su family, her family was very worried, fearing that she would be in grave danger. However, Cui Shaodi was very understanding and, fearing that her family would worry, she comforted them by saying that if she were dealing with wood or stone, she wouldn’t be confident in being able to move them. But she was marrying into a family of humans, and there was no reason why they wouldn’t be moved. Of course, Shaodi had this mindset because she firmly believed in the teaching that “At the beginning of life, people are inherently good.” In fact, even stones can be moved, right? Master Shengong's teachings moved even the stubbornest rocks to nod in agreement. Now, Dr. Masaru Emoto has also proven that all matter is organic and can receive people's thoughts and magnetic fields. So if plants and minerals can be moved, how much more can people be moved?

With this conviction, she married into the family. Whenever she obtained something good, whether from her maiden home – delicious food or useful items – she would share it with her sisters-in-law and her nephews. When her mother-in-law assigned chores, and her four sisters-in-law were unwilling to do them, she would say, “I am the last one to join the family, let me do a bit more.” She took the work upon herself. Thus, she did not haggle over money and did not complain about doing more work. “Value material possessions lightly.” Her sisters-in-law often engaged in malicious gossip, criticizing and slandering each other. When they spoke to Cui Shaodi, she would listen, but she wouldn’t react. She would just smile. When others criticize and slander and we don't react, they will usually stop talking to us after a couple of times. The magnetic field isn't compatible. Normally, when someone starts talking, the two of them will get increasingly heated. When someone speaks, and we just smile without reacting, they will be unable to continue. Why would they be unable to continue? Because people have a conscience. When they criticize others and the other person doesn't react, they feel a bit guilty themselves.

And if her servants came to tell her about the wrongdoings of her sisters-in-law, she would punish the servants and then take them to apologize to her sisters-in-law. I doubt that many modern people could do this. On the surface, it seems unkind, but it was actually intended to ensure the future happiness of the servants. These servants were only teenagers. They would get married in the future, and if they didn't get rid of the habit of spreading rumors, their future lives would be difficult. Wise people educate their children and servants with the long term in mind. This is the level of Shaodi’s cultivation and conduct. Generally speaking, most people like to take small advantages, dislike working, enjoy gossiping, and like hearing gossip. But Shaodi was able to maintain her principles, not be affected by these things, and act as an example.

On one occasion, she was holding a young nephew, who was still very small. As she held him, the baby urinated, soiling her new silk dress. Her sister-in-law saw this, felt very embarrassed that her own child had wet the fifth aunt, and hurriedly went to take the baby. Shaodi immediately said, “Don’t rush, or you’ll startle the child.” Who was she concerned about? The child. Was she worried about her beautiful dress? No. Can you imagine how touched the child's mother must have been? Very touched. If things like this happened frequently, how could people not be moved? Because they were living together. So after about a year, her four sisters-in-law said, “The fifth aunt is truly virtuous. We are not even worthy to be considered people.” They felt ashamed.

Therefore, scholars praised Cui Shaodi’s conduct: “If people contended thrice and yielded thrice, there would be no greedy people in the world.” When people contend, if we yield to them, and yield thrice, then the other person will feel ashamed.  They will think: "Are you a noble person, and only I am acting like a petty person?" And then, they will be gradually transformed. “If people grew angry thrice and smiled thrice, there would be no ferocious people in the world.” When others are rude or get angry, we shouldn't argue with them. We should just give them a slight smile. After a few times, they will also feel embarrassed. Therefore, this passage reminds us of a motto: "There are no people who cannot be transformed; the only fear is that our sincerity is not sufficient. There are no things that cannot be done; the only fear is that our determination is not firm.” Therefore, “when we find our conduct wanting, we should reflect on ourselves.”

The first half of this passage tells us that the true joy in life does not come from external stimuli, but from the natural, inner joy—the joy of family, because filial piety and fraternal love are our innate nature.

The second half of the passage talks about "Completing national taxes early, even if the purse is empty, one will naturally find great joy." “National taxes” refer to paying taxes. Every citizen has the obligation to pay taxes. If we pay our taxes early and fulfill our civic duty, even if we are "囊橐無餘," meaning that our purses are empty, even if we have no spare money, we have still fulfilled our duty. Therefore, our conscience is clear and we will experience “natural joy”.  This joy is from having a clear conscience, of feeling “no shame before Heaven and no blushing before others.” We are worthy of our country and countrymen, and we have fulfilled our duties. This teaching tells us that we must not evade or avoid taxes, but must fulfill our responsibilities and duties. Because tax revenue is the most important source of financial income for the entire nation. With tax revenue, the country can provide benefits to all citizens, whether it's used for national development or the education of the next generation. All of these expenses come from taxes.

I remember when I was a child, I would see my father calculating how much tax he should pay. I was deeply impressed. Every time the date came, I would see my father carefully calculating. It left me with the impression that my father was very proper and followed the rules in paying the country's taxes. Inevitably, children will have a sense of respect for their father and will learn this important attitude. If parents evade taxes, then the children will follow suit.  This phenomenon does happen. There are families who evade taxes and even think that they are very smart for taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, not understanding principles is the biggest misfortune in life. It will cause people to commit many wrongdoings that are difficult to rectify. In particular, tax evasion is a very serious sin.  There is a saying, "Debts have creditors, and wrongs have perpetrators." Today, when you pay taxes, the money belongs to the country. Evading taxes is equivalent to stealing the country's money. If you are living in China, tax evasion is very troublesome. Who are the creditors? Billions of people! Therefore, there is a saying: "One lifetime as an official, nine lifetimes as a cow," meaning that if an official steals money from the country, they will have to be reborn as a cow for nine lifetimes to repay their debt. The words of our ancestors are full of profound meaning. Therefore, those who truly understand principles would never do such a foolish thing, and would never become "a petty person." Moreover, they would be very afraid of being investigated, and would live in fear constantly.  They would have no way to feel “no shame before Heaven and no blushing before others.” Therefore, "a noble person is happy being a noble person."  We should do our best to fulfill the duties we should.  When a person is constantly fulfilling their duties to the country, that person will have boundless future blessings.

My teacher, Professor Shi Jingkong, once said that when he was in school, during the war against Japan, their principal and teachers were very honest. They cherished national property. Although they were also very poor back then, later in life, their children and grandchildren all prospered.  "A noble person is happy being a noble person."  Therefore, this is an example of natural joy. When people have a clear conscience, they will be happy every day.  Therefore, happiness is not from outside stimuli; it is decided by one's inner state.

*The Analects* says, “To learn and at due times to repeat what one has learnt, is that not, after all, a pleasure?” Learning should be a joyful experience. However, why do people today feel that “To learn and at due times to repeat what one has learnt, is that not, after all, a suffering?” This means that they have definitely learned incorrectly. The next teaching tells us how to read to truly find joy:

**"Study should aim to attain the level of sages and worthies, not merely to pass examinations; serve the government with a heart for the country, not for personal gain."**

Today, we are discussing how to achieve a joyful life. First of all, the goal is very important. As mentioned earlier, if your goal is to seek pleasure, you will not find joy. If your goal is in line with your inherent goodness and virtuous nature, then joy will not be found only upon reaching your goal. Rather, the entire process will be joyful, peaceful, and lived in harmony with your family. For example, when we think about having shown filial piety to our grandparents ten or twenty years ago, even though they may no longer be with us, we still feel a sense of comfort that we have repaid their kindness. The kind of joy that is derived from external stimuli is short lived; it is not true joy.

When we think about this passage, we can see that if your goals are wrong, you will not be able to find true joy. What are people's goals for studying today? Degrees, money, fame, and income. True joy is not found externally; striving outwardly is about comparison. When we compare ourselves to others, if we have a degree, but someone else has a higher degree, how can we still feel happy? Moreover, why do people today want to have higher degrees?  For higher salaries. And even if they make money, they are still not satisfied, they want to have a high position and great power. They will always be comparing themselves with others. Can this kind of goal bring happiness?  Although people seem to have more and more of these material things today, they don't seem to be happy.  There is a saying, "Comparing yourself to others is enough to make you angry to death.” Today, people don't just compare themselves to others, they also compare their spouses and children. Just thinking about it makes one feel suffocated.  And people still go and do this to themselves, seeking their own suffering. The goal is wrong. Because as long as you strive outwardly, what will this type of goal bring? The suffering of "seeking, but not attaining.”

Therefore, the goal of studying should not be to obtain a degree, but to obtain wisdom and understanding. If you study in this way, you will become wiser and more understanding. Your body and mind will become increasingly free and at ease. This is true joy. The goal should not be to make money, but to be able to repay our parents and country and to help those who are suffering. When we are making money with different goals in mind, there will be a big difference in whether it is a happy or painful experience. When making money for the sake of being filial to our parents and benefiting our country and the people, the process is joyful. If the only goal is to satisfy our desires, then our greed will have no limits. Therefore, the goal decides whether the entire process will be painful or joyful.

It is the same when it comes to pursuing fame and wanting to become a high-ranking official. If that is your goal, when you compare yourself to others, you will be angry when you see that other people are being promoted. However, our goal should not be to seek empty fame and superficial wealth, but to benefit the people: “If you are in office, you must benefit the people.”  Therefore, what is the true purpose of studying?  We need to think about this clearly, and if we do, then our children will understand too.

My teacher once went to Europe and visited some famous sinology institutes. These foreigners who study Chinese studies have studied so much that they can become professors and receive a good salary. However, they treat the sacred books of the Chinese sages as ancient culture for research. My teacher sighed with deep emotion. Our ancestors’ Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist classics are meant to cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. When they are treated as academic subjects, their value is greatly diminished. This is a mistake. Professors are teachers. Their responsibility is to “transmit knowledge, impart skills, and resolve doubts.” They should pass on the profound wisdom of how to regulate the family and govern the state to their students. Otherwise, they are enjoying the blessings of their position without fulfilling their obligations, which they will pay the price for. Nobody can just enjoy blessings without fulfilling their responsibilities. There is a story that if a teacher doesn't properly educate and cultivate their students and acts as a true spiritual engineer, but only collects a salary, and fails to teach their students how to be good people, then they will fall into the nineteenth layer of hell. Therefore, we must be clear that when we enjoy blessings, we also have responsibilities.

“Study should aim to attain the level of sages and worthies.” Who are sages and worthies? In every profession, each person who can fulfill their duty can be a sage or worthy. Is a mother a sage? The three Tai of the Zhou Dynasty were role models for mothers, and the term "太太" (madam) comes from this historical example. Therefore, if one becomes a virtuous mother, then she is a sage.  And from a sage mother come sage descendants. In the business world, the merchants of Hui and Shanxi all used the teachings of the sages in their own respective professions. In education, there is the way of a teacher; in politics, there is the way of a ruler; and in the medical field, there is the way of medicine.  Zhang Zhongjing and Sun Simiao were the sages of the medical field.  We should practice the teachings in our respective positions, become role models, and act as sages and worthies, which will contribute to the society and the nation.

How can we emulate sages and worthies? By emulating their intentions. What does it mean to love and respect sages and worthies?  The *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* says, “To love and respect everyone is to love and respect sages and worthies.” Because the heart of sages and worthies is to hope that everyone can live a good life, we should learn from this.  “People should not only care for their own parents, or only care for their own children, but should care for the elders so they have a place to go at the end of their lives, care for those who are strong so they can be utilized, and care for the young so they can grow.” This truly means ensuring that all professions, both men and women, both young and old, and especially the elderly and children, can live happy lives.

In reality, what is most important to achieve this goal?  The most important thing is to promote the teachings of the sages so that everyone will have correct values and will know the five relationships and the eight virtues. Then, wouldn't every family be living a good life, wouldn't every child grow up healthily, and wouldn't all the elderly be taken care of by their descendants? Therefore, the *Book of Rites* says, “To govern a state and its people, education must come first.” In this day and age, the teachings of the sages have declined. If we truly want to benefit all of humanity, then the best approach is to promote education.

My teacher dedicated his entire life to giving lectures and his influence has been extremely wide-reaching. In ancient times, during the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zheng Xuan had many opportunities to become an official, but he aimed to attain the level of sages and worthies and benefit others. He wasn't seeking to pass examinations, gain fame, or obtain a high salary. He was ambitious. He declined the many offers to become an official. Instead, he dedicated himself to studying and teaching his students. During that time, tens of thousands of people were taught by him. He was a great Confucian scholar of the Eastern Han dynasty and a master of the classics. Many annotations of the Thirteen Classics come from Zheng Xuan.

The Eastern Han dynasty was more than a thousand years ago. By insisting on lecturing and teaching, Zheng Xuan left behind many works that still benefit people more than a thousand years later. If he had spent his efforts solely on becoming an official at the time, would he have been able to influence future generations this much? He would not have. Therefore, parents, you must carefully consider the path that your children will take in the future.  Zheng Xuan is a good example, and my teacher is also a good example. If we understand the importance of education, then we can learn well, guide our children down this path, and I believe many contemporary great sinologists will emerge, starting with everyone's aspirations.

Zheng Xuan studied with his teacher, Ma Rong. Ma Rong had a habit of listening to singers while lecturing. Almost all of the students would listen to the lecture, and then look at the girls singing. Only Zheng Xuan never glanced at them because he was determined to become a sage. He was focused and not affected at all. Therefore, having the right goal is important. “Study should aim to attain the level of sages and worthies, not merely to pass examinations.” When we set our goals for the next generation, we should make sure that they strive to become a sage, not wasting any time.

The next sentence says: “Serve the government with a heart for the country, not for personal gain.” “Serving the government,” in ancient times, meant being an official, acting on behalf of the country, and benefiting the people, receiving the grace of the emperor. In modern times, it can be interpreted more broadly as being a civil servant. Let's consider this: civil servants receive their salaries from the public, which is the money of the taxpayers. Therefore, "the salary you receive is the toil of the people" and the blood and sweat of the taxpayers. We must not be ungrateful. "Serve the government with a heart for the country" means to be mindful of the kindness of the emperor and the people and not only focus on one’s own wealth and happiness. This teaching is actually telling us to be loyal to the sovereign, love our country, and be grateful and seek to repay our country.

Fan Zhongyan was a good example. “He worried about the world before others worried, and enjoyed himself after others enjoyed,” "When he is in the high palace he is concerned about his people".  When he was serving at court, he focused on seeking benefits for the people. “When he is in the remote countryside, he is concerned about the emperor,” never forgetting the kindness of the emperor.  Fan Zhongyan truly achieved, "accepting the gifts of others with shame.”  He would accept the salary that was given to him by the country, but he felt shame constantly. Every night before going to sleep, Fan Zhongyan would think: "Did I do enough today to be worthy of the country's salary?" If he felt that he had, then he would sleep peacefully.  If he thought that he hadn’t tried hard enough, then he wouldn’t be able to sleep the entire night, so he would get up early the next day to work hard for the country. “Accepting the gifts of others with shame.”  If people today did not have these role models, if they were not guided or educated, then they would still be muddling through life, and taking advantage of the country by doing less work and seeking more pay, creating bad karma.

How should civil servants be truly loyal to their country and love their country?  The *Comprehensive Rulers of Governance* (群書治要３６０) offers four important guidelines. First, “Establish Integrity.” That means we should be good role models as civil servants. This is how we make a contribution.  Yang Zhen's four awarenesses:  Heaven knows, the spirits know, you know, and I know.  His integrity served as the best role model for those in politics and for people in future generations.

The second guideline is, “Be completely devoted.” When we think of Zhuge Liang, we think of his utmost dedication and the fact that he never stopped working until his death. There was also Sima Guang of the Song Dynasty, who was also very ill, but he still wouldn’t rest. He was still thinking about how the four evils of the nation hadn’t been eradicated. One was that Xixia hadn't surrendered. The other three were related to the existing systems which needed to be reformed.  Although he was very ill, he was still very worried about the affairs of state. When his friends saw him eating less and less, they warned him, “If you eat so little and work so much, you will probably end up like Zhuge Liang and die from overwork.”  But Sima Guang said, “Life and death are determined by fate.” He did not consider his own life. Later when he became gravely ill and started to lose his lucidity, he would dream and speak about the affairs of state. His utmost dedication fills us with admiration.

The third is “Advise and Remonstrate.” Whether it is the national leaders or the leaders of an organization, their influence is very significant. As civil servants, we should know how to advise and remonstrate effectively. We need to have wisdom, have good strategies, and be gentle. We can’t be too aggressive.

Wei Zheng’s advice to Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty was very clever. When Emperor Taizong’s wife passed away, he could not let go of her. He even built a tall building so that he could climb up and look at the place where his wife was buried. This affected his ability to govern the nation. One day, he brought Wei Zheng to the top of the building. Then, Emperor Taizong said that he was looking at Zhaoling (the tomb of his late wife). Wei Zheng replied, “I thought you were looking at Xianling (the tomb of his parents).” Emperor Taizong was a smart person. When he heard this, he thought that he was being shameful for only thinking about his wife and not his parents. Therefore, he had the platform torn down. Wei Zheng didn’t reprimand him, but cleverly brought up Emperor Taizong’s filial piety, preventing him from being immersed in his emotions.  This benefited the entire nation. We should have the wisdom to advise and remonstrate.

The fourth is to “Recommend the worthy.” It is important to recommend talented people for the good of the country. Bao Shuya recommended Guan Zhong. His descendants became well-known officials for more than ten generations. Zeng Guofan and Lin Zexu of the Qing Dynasty were both always keeping records of the talented people they met and would recommend them whenever they had the opportunity. This enabled them to benefit a great many people. When we hear this, we should also prepare notebooks to record the talented people that we meet so that we can recommend them. We shouldn’t just listen to stories without learning from them.

Finally:

**“Accept our fate and be content with our lot. Adapt to the times and listen to Heaven. If one behaves in this way, one may be considered to be on the right path.”**

“Accept our fate and be content with our lot” means that every day is fulfilling and happy, that we are content with our duty.  We all have our own duties. For every role, there is a duty:  A father is compassionate – compassion is a duty. A child is filial – filial piety is a duty. Older siblings are friendly to younger siblings;  a ruler is benevolent towards their subjects and a subject is loyal to their ruler.  A leader is loving and caring for their subordinates, which is a duty. A subject should be loyal. A husband should be just, and a wife should be virtuous. Elders should be kind and younger people should be compliant. Friends should be trustworthy. All of these are our duties. If we fulfill our duties, then our conscience is clear, therefore we should “accept our fate,” meaning be content with our own fate and not complain or blame others.

In particular, *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* teaches us how to transform our fate. The reason why people have bad fates is because of the roots within their hearts.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, striving for accuracy, natural flow, and attention to the nuances of the original:

**Title: Understanding Destiny, Seizing Opportunities, and Embracing Our Responsibilities**

The saying goes, "Use a mirror to see your appearance." Looking in a mirror, you see your own face. Similarly, "use your heart to see fortune and misfortune." Whether good or bad fortune comes, it is a result of your own heart's actions, not something to blame on others. Therefore, to truly understand fate, you should not complain about heaven or blame others when encountering anything, but instead, self-reflect. Everything becomes an opportunity for self-improvement. This is the right way to "accept one's fate," to know your place and accept your lot. "Simply do good deeds, and don't worry about the future."

“Obey the times and listen to heaven.” Go with the flow of the times. Individuals have their own fate and fortune, and so do nations and groups. Like our China today, since Chairman Xi took office, he has vigorously promoted traditional culture. This sign is that the prosperous age of the entire Chinese nation is about to rise. We must act in accordance with this trend. Therefore, Mencius said that even with farming tools, you should wait for spring to arrive before plowing. Even with wisdom, you must wait for a good leader and a good ruler to appear, so you can follow this momentum and do more for the country. So now is a great opportunity, we must seize it. However, we must have the strength; otherwise, if a good opportunity comes and we rush in to make a mess, it won't work. If the time is not ripe, don’t be impatient or crave it, or you'll be asking for trouble.

Mr. Lin Zexu said, "When fortune is unfavorable, seeking in vain is useless." If now is not the time to shine, then quickly accumulate virtue and capability. Otherwise, when the real opportunity comes, and your virtue and ability are lacking, you will ultimately create bad karma instead of accumulating merit and virtue, and that would be truly unfortunate. Therefore, if you truly have ability, heaven will arrange things. “Obey the times and listen to heaven.” Do not feel like you are a genius who is unrecognized. To harbor resentment for being unrecognized is also wrong. “When poor, cultivate your own virtue; when successful, help the world.” A noble person is “content in any situation.” They are happy and at peace in any circumstance, and will not complain. Let good opportunities “come naturally when the water flows and the melon is ripe.”

Therefore, “obey the times” means to grasp the timing and the trend of the times; “listen to heaven” means to obey the will of heaven and follow the principles of nature. Heaven has a virtue of cherishing life. We should do our best to give every day. Confucius understood his mandate from heaven at the age of fifty. Do we know our mandate from heaven? What are we here to do in this life? Everyone is here learning *The Zhuzi Family Precepts*, so you are all aware of your mandate. Which mandate do we know first? To educate the next generation well is our responsibility. This is accepting our fate and fulfilling our duty. Furthermore, to inherit and promote Chinese culture to the world, this is our mandate from heaven. Especially for Chinese people in Malaysia, who are proficient in English and Malay, they have a great responsibility.

"If a person acts this way, he is almost there." If a person can live according to the teachings throughout *The Zhuzi Family Precepts*, "Shu" (庶), meaning almost or nearly, then "he is almost there," which means he is approaching the realm of sages and virtuous people. This sentence also encourages us to implement each and every precept one by one. "Don't be self-destructive, don't give up on yourself. Sages and wise men can be reached through training." "What was Shun? What am I? If one strives to improve, one can achieve the same." The most important thing is perseverance, and the most important thing is determination. Ability is not the key, because as long as you have determination and perseverance, the innate, complete potential of a person will gradually emerge. The *Doctrine of the Mean* tells us: "If others accomplish it with one try, I will do it one hundred times; if others accomplish it with ten tries, I will do it one thousand times. If one can follow this principle, even if one is foolish, one will become wise; even if one is weak, one will become strong." If others can achieve it once, it doesn't matter, I will do it a hundred times. If others can achieve it ten times, it doesn’t matter, I will do it a thousand times. With such determination and perseverance, foolishness will turn into wisdom, and weakness will turn into strength.

Okay, let us encourage each other with this final sentence, "If others accomplish it with one try, I will do it one hundred times; if others accomplish it with ten tries, I will do it one thousand times," and together, inherit our family traditions, and together, inherit the five thousand years of culture and wisdom of our Chinese nation.

This concludes our sharing for *The Zhuzi Family Precepts* course. I also wish everyone a peaceful and healthy new year, family safety, to accept your fate, and to obey the times and listen to heaven. We aspire to be sages and virtuous, and not live this life in vain as descendants of Yan and Huang (the legendary ancestors of the Chinese).
