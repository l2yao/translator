## Sayings on Spiritual Practice

**Compiled by Kaohsiung Pure Land Learning Association**

**Foreword**

The Buddha-dharma is the greatest treasure in the human world. The Buddha revealed the truth of the universe and life, the principles of cause and effect, and the methods for pursuing a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life, liberation from the six realms of reincarnation, and freedom from birth and death. With the ultimate, complete, unsurpassed, right, and equal enlightenment of an enlightened one, the Buddha imparted this to all future learners, so that they may find peace and happiness in this life and liberation at the time of death.

However, after the Buddha-dharma passed from the era of True Dharma in India two or three thousand years ago, it entered the era of Semblance Dharma after being introduced to China during the Eastern Han Dynasty. By the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, it had entered the era of Decline Dharma. The Buddha had long foreseen that the Dharma's fortune would gradually decline because the minds of people in the era of Decline Dharma would be more corrupt, ethics would be more superficial, and the chaos of the world would intensify. The maladies of the Buddhist community would also worsen. However, the Buddha's teachings are without fault; the spirit and essence of the Dharma remain unchanged. It is simply that sentient beings in the era of Decline Dharma have deep karmic obstacles, little blessings and wisdom, and inferior faculties. Those who propagate the Dharma do not understand the faculties, and there are problems with teaching. Those who study the Dharma practice blindly, and there are problems with learning. Even demons and heretics infiltrate the Buddhist community, using seemingly Buddhist teachings to seek fame and reputation and amass wealth. In the era of Decline Dharma, heretical teachers speak like the sands of the Ganges. If Buddhist practitioners are not careful, they can easily deviate from the spirit and essence of Buddhism, fall into evil traps, and unknowingly become descendants of demons.

In the era of Decline Dharma, it is difficult to find good teachers and enlightened mentors. Everywhere are outwardly glamorous, but inconsistent, heretical teachers. Everywhere are demons leading the blind, recruiting followers and building crowds. If Buddhist practitioners cannot distinguish between right and wrong and have their own convictions, they will easily parrot others, be contaminated by demonic views, become possessed, and plunge themselves into irreversible situations. Everyone must not underestimate this point.

In fact, the safest and most reliable way to study Buddhism in the era of Decline Dharma is to "take the ancients as your teacher," taking the lofty, renowned ancestors and virtuous teachers of all ages as your teachers, and taking their precious instructions as our guiding principles for practice. Among them, the most recent and widely revered is Master Yinguang. Therefore, books such as "The Complete Works of Master Yinguang," "Excerpts from Master Yinguang's Writings," and "Q&A Excerpts from the Complete Works of Master Yinguang" should be regarded as the standard and cherished as daily-reviewed treasures by those who aspire to study Buddhism. Constantly reading Master Yinguang's writings and striving to put them into practice is like constantly being close to Master Yinguang, like being an initiated disciple of Master Yinguang. By studying Buddhism in this way, one will surely make daily progress and be assured of success!

This book, "Sayings on Spiritual Practice," hopes to capture the most essential teachings of the Buddha in the scriptures, combined with the most important advice from the teachings of past masters and virtuous teachers. This will allow our inferior and foolish beings in the era of Decline Dharma to grasp the key points of Buddhist practice in the shortest amount of time. By practicing accordingly, we can follow in the footsteps of the Buddha and past masters and successfully embark on the bright path to peace and liberation!

**Ten Key Points of Spiritual Practice**

**1. Filial Piety to Parents**

Buddhism regards filial piety as fundamental. Filial piety to parents is the greatest foundation of Buddhism and the most basic requirement of being human. Consider that even crows know how to feed back to their parents to repay their kindness. If we cannot be filial to our parents, are we not even worse than animals?

Parents are the greatest fields of merit in our lives. The merit of being filial to parents is no different from the merit of being filial to the Buddha. Not being filial to parents is the greatest mistake in life. An unfilial person is not qualified to study Buddhism.

Furthermore, persuading parents to believe, make vows, and recite the Buddha's name, seeking rebirth in the West, and permanently escaping the suffering of reincarnation is the most ultimate and complete filial piety.

**2. Fulfilling One's Duty**

Living in this world, everyone has their own duties and responsibilities. Buddhist practitioners should work diligently in their respective positions and be model examples for their families, society, and country. Being able to be filial to parents, educate children, care for family, benefit society, and serve the country is a true Buddhist practitioner. Evading one's own responsibilities, failing to fulfill one's duty, and talking glibly about studying Buddhism is self-deception. There can be no achievement in studying Buddhism.

**3. Deep Faith in Cause and Effect**

The core of the entire Buddha-dharma is the two words "cause and effect." Sowing good causes will surely yield good results, and sowing evil causes will surely yield evil results. The retribution of cause and effect is never off; it is not that it is not repaid, but the time has not yet come. Buddhist practitioners should deeply believe in cause and effect, taking the precepts as their teacher, reflecting daily, and correcting their faults at any time.

Furthermore, those who recite the Buddha's name deeply believe that sowing the good cause of reciting the Buddha's name will surely yield the good result of attaining Buddhahood. This is the most profound cause and effect.

**4. Abstaining from Killing and Eating Vegetarian**

Buddhist practitioners should avoid all evil, striving to eliminate all sinful behaviors. Among all sins, the sin of killing and eating meat is the most serious because what all sentient beings value most is their own life. Killing them and eating them, they are most resentful, and the grudges are the deepest. In the future, killing debts will be repaid with killing, blood debts will be repaid with blood, and the evil consequences will be the most tragic. Therefore, among all evils to be avoided, abstaining from killing and eating vegetarian is the most urgent!

**5. Releasing Life and Saving Lives**

Buddhist practitioners should practice all good deeds. Any good deed, as long as there is an opportunity, should be diligently practiced. Among all good deeds, releasing life is the foremost because releasing life is an act of saving life in times of emergency, and its merit is the greatest, not comparable to other small good deeds. What all sentient beings value most is their own life. Releasing them and saving them, they are most grateful, the good connections are the deepest, and the future blessings and good rewards are the most inconceivable. Therefore, among all good deeds to be practiced, releasing life and saving lives comes first!

**6. Utmost Sincerity and Respect**

Sincerity and respect are the foundation for accomplishing any undertaking in the world. Master Yinguang further taught us to do our best to bring the two words "sincerity and respect" to the extreme. Having one part of sincerity and respect brings one part of merit; having ten parts of sincerity and respect brings ten parts of merit. This is the wonderful secret to the success or failure of studying Buddhism, and everyone must keep it firmly in mind!

**7. Arousing the Bodhi Mind**

The magnitude of the merit of studying Buddhism is directly proportional to the capacity of one's mind. The greater the capacity of the mind, the greater the merit. Therefore, the mind of a Buddhist practitioner must be large! Doing anything must not be for selfish gain! One must truly and sincerely arouse the mind from within to truly benefit all sentient beings. We seek the Buddha's path upward, vowing that after becoming a Buddha, we will have the ability to universally liberate sentient beings. We transform sentient beings downward, vowing that if there is an opportunity, we must spread the most essential points of the Dharma to the masses.

Furthermore, the true willingness to recite the Buddha's name and seek rebirth in the Western Pure Land is the true arousing of the Bodhi Mind.

**8. Worshipping the Buddha and Repenting**

The sins we have committed over countless lifetimes, if they had substance and form, could not be contained even if all of space were filled. We are, in reality, just foolish and wicked ordinary beings with heavy karmic obstacles. Therefore, Buddhist practitioners should arouse a sense of shame and repentance, diligently practice bowing to the Buddha because one bow to the Buddha extinguishes sins as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Worshipping the Buddha and repenting is the best way to express our sincerity, respect, shame, and self-reflection.

**9. Faith, Vows, and Recitation of the Buddha's Name**

The Pure Land Dharma Door relies on the Buddha's power to save. "Faith" means believing that there is an Amitabha Buddha in the Western Pure Land. "Vow" means being willing to quickly be reborn in the Pure Land, detesting this world of suffering. "Practice" means honestly and earnestly holding onto the sacred name of "Namo Amitabha Buddha." As long as the three provisions of "faith, vow, and practice" are complete, one can, in this very life, rely on the great vow power of Amitabha Buddha to be rescued, transcend birth and death, permanently end reincarnation. It is the most profound, most wonderful, most special, and most convenient Dharma Door in all of Buddhism!

Logically speaking, the phrase "Amitabha Buddha" relies on the Buddha's power to save and is an absolute guarantee of being reborn in the West. But why are there many people reciting the Buddha's name today, but few who are truly reborn in the West?

This is a very serious and crucial question. The key reason why people reciting the Buddha's name today cannot be reborn is that they "lack faith and vows, fear death, and fundamentally do not want to be reborn." Today, people reciting the Buddha's name only seek longevity, health, peace, wealth, and success, seeking all worldly benefits, but never seeking rebirth in the West!

The word "death" can be used to test whether a person reciting the Buddha's name has sufficient faith and vows. Ask yourself, are you afraid of death? If you had to die right now, and Amitabha Buddha would immediately come to take you to be reborn in the West, would you be willing? A true Buddhist reciter who truly detests the Saha world and yearns for the Pure Land of Bliss will surely regard death as returning home, always willing to go to the Western Pure Land with Amitabha Buddha sooner rather than later. They are absolutely not afraid of death, immediately willing to die, and immediately willing to be reborn at any time. As for those who are inconsistent in word and deed, false in faith and empty in vows, they are greedy for life and afraid of death, unwilling to die, and unwilling to be reborn, with too many reasons to tie them down and prevaricate. Know that this one fear of death, unwillingness to die, and unwillingness to seek rebirth, is contrary to the mind of Amitabha Buddha. If the three provisions of faith, vows, and practice are not complete, how can one successfully be reborn in the West?

Most people reciting the Buddha's name today, nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand, are false Buddhist reciters. The word "death" must be constantly in your mind, constantly examining yourself. As long as a Buddhist reciter is not afraid of death, likes death, is willing to die at any time, and is willing to be reborn in the Pure Land sooner rather than later, then they are a true Buddhist reciter who truly "detests the Saha world and yearns for the Pure Land of Bliss." Such people are reborn a thousand times out of a thousand recitations, ten thousand times out of ten thousand recitations. There is absolutely no one who is not reborn in the West!

**10. Practice and Implementation**

The most important thing in Buddhism is practice. An illiterate old woman who doesn't understand the scriptures at all, only knows how to be vegetarian, worship the Buddha, and honestly hold onto the phrase "Amitabha Buddha," often achieves far more in studying Buddhism than a great scholar who is eloquent and proficient in the three baskets. The key lies in whether or not one can practice and implement. Knowing but not being able to act is like armchair strategy, counting treasures while talking about food; it is only in vain!

In summary, in studying Buddhism, one should only seek focus and avoid mixing. As long as you grasp the key points and strive to put them into practice, you can truly obtain the real benefits of the Dharma.

**I. Essence of the Five Pure Land Sutras**

**The Amitabha Sutra Spoken by the Buddha**

*   "From here, passing westward through a hundred thousand kotis of Buddha-lands, there is a world called Sukhavati (Ultimate Bliss). In that land there is a Buddha called Amitabha, who is now teaching the Dharma."

*   "The beings in that land experience no suffering, but only enjoy every kind of happiness. For this reason, it is called 'Ultimate Bliss.'"

*   "In that Buddha-land there are no three evil paths. Sariputra, in that Buddha-land even the name of the evil paths does not exist. How much less could there be the reality of them?"

*   "The light of that Buddha is measureless, shining throughout all the worlds in the ten directions without any obstruction. For this reason, he is called 'Amitabha.'"

*   "The life of that Buddha and that of the people is measureless, limitless asamkhya kalpas. For this reason, he is called 'Amitabha.'"

*   "Since Amitabha Buddha attained Buddhahood, ten kalpas have passed."

*   "Beings born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss are all Avaivartika (non-retrogressing)."

*   "Sentient beings who hear of this should make a vow to be born in that country. Why? Because they will be able to come together in one place with such superior people."

*   "One cannot be born in that land with few good roots, blessings, meritorious virtues, and causes."

*   "If there are good men or good women who hear spoken the name of Amitabha Buddha and hold fast to the name, for one day, two days, three days, four days, five days, six days, or seven days, with a unified mind, undisturbed, when these people approach the end of their lives, Amitabha Buddha, together with the host of holy ones, will appear before them. At the time of death, their minds will not be confused, and they will immediately be reborn in Amitabha Buddha's Land of Ultimate Bliss."

*   "If there are sentient beings who hear of this teaching, they should make a vow to be born in that land."

*   "You sentient beings should believe in these Sutras praising the inconceivable merit and virtue which all Buddhas protect and bear in mind."

*   "If there are good men or good women who hear this Sutra and receive and uphold it, and hear the names of the Buddhas, all these good men and good women will be protected and borne in mind by all the Buddhas, and they will all attain non-retrogression from Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi."

*   "All of you should believe and accept my words and the teachings spoken by all the Buddhas."

*   "If there are people who have already made a vow, who now make a vow, or who will make a vow, desiring to be born in Amitabha Buddha's country, all these people will attain non-retrogression from Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi. In that land, whether they are already born, are now born, or will be born."

*   "Good men, good women, if there are those who believe, they should make a vow to be born in that land."

*   "You should know that I, in the evil world of the five turbidities, have performed this difficult deed of attaining Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi and for the sake of all the world speaking this Dharma which is difficult to believe. This is extremely difficult."

*   "When I attain Buddhahood, the sentient beings of the ten directions who, hearing my name, believe it with a sincere heart, and turn all their roots of goodness toward wishing to be born in my country, even with ten recitations, if they are not born there, I will not attain Right Enlightenment. Excepted are those who commit the five rebellious acts and slander the Right Dharma."

*   "Always use a compassionate heart to save sentient beings, delivering all sentient beings from boundless suffering."

*   "Well protect your oral karma; do not criticize others' faults.

    Well protect your bodily karma; do not violate the rules of conduct.

    Well protect your mental karma; be pure and unpolluted."

*   "Now, to the West, one hundred thousand kotis of nayutas of Buddha-lands from Jambudvipa, there is a world called Sukhavati. Dharmakara became a Buddha, named Amitabha. Since becoming a Buddha, ten kalpas have now passed. He is now teaching the Dharma."

*   "The awesome power and light of Amitabha Buddha are most honored and foremost. The Buddhas of the ten directions cannot reach it."

*   "Only Amitabha Buddha's light universally shines on measureless, limitless, countless Buddha-lands."

*   "Amitabha Buddha's light is good and excellent, surpassing the brightness of the sun and moon by billions of times. He is the most honored in light and the King among Buddhas."

*   "All those in the worlds of the ten directions who are reborn there are naturally born from lotus flowers in seven-jeweled ponds. They all receive pure, empty bodies, bodies without limit. They do not hear the names of the sufferings and difficulties of the three evil paths. Even the assumption of such suffering does not exist, how much less the actual suffering? There is only the sound of natural happiness. Therefore, that country is called 'Ultimate Bliss.'"

*   "Arousing the Bodhi Mind and single-mindedly reciting Amitabha Buddha, cultivating all kinds of merit and virtue, and vowing to be born in that country, when these sentient beings approach the end of their lives, Amitabha Buddha, together with the host of holy ones, will appear before them. In a very short time, they will follow that Buddha to be reborn in that country."

*   "Those sentient beings who wish to see Amitabha Buddha in this life should arouse the unsurpassed Bodhi Mind and single-mindedly recite the Land of Ultimate Bliss, accumulating roots of goodness and turning them toward wishing to be reborn there. By this, they will see the Buddha, be born in that country, and attain non-retrogression, even to unsurpassed Bodhi."

*   "You should arouse the unsurpassed Bodhi Mind and single-mindedly recite Amitabha Buddha."

*   "You must be filial and obedient, perfectly sincere and faithful. You must believe the profound words of the Buddha's Sutras, and you must believe that doing good brings blessings."

*   "All those who are reborn there attain Avaivartika (non-retrogression), all possess golden bodies with the thirty-two marks, and all will become Buddhas."

*   "Measureless, countless, inconceivable, without compare, immeasurable worlds, Buddhas, and Tathagatas all together praise the merit and virtue possessed by Amitabha Buddha."

*   "Through that Buddha's fundamental vow power, upon hearing his name, desiring to be reborn there, one will naturally attain non-retrogression."

*   "Good men, good women in the world, if they are in urgent difficulty and fear, they need only take refuge in Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, and there is no one who will not be freed."

*   "In the eight directions, above and below, there are countless Buddha-lands. Amitabha's country is long-lasting and vast, bright, good, and joyful, and uniquely supreme."

*   "The Buddhas' secret treasury is ultimately understood."

*   "The people of the world all contend for matters that are not urgent. In this extremely evil and extremely painful situation, they diligently engage in activities to provide for themselves. The noble and the humble, the rich and the poor, the young and the old, men and women, with accumulated thoughts and worries, are driven by their minds. Those without fields worry about fields; those without houses worry about houses; and family members and possessions, whether they have them or not, cause worry."

*   "People are born alone in the midst of love and desire, and they die alone. They leave alone and come alone. Suffering and joy are borne by themselves; there is no one to take their place."

*   "Why not strive to cultivate goodness while you are strong and healthy? What are you waiting for?"

*   "Those who mislead are many; those who awaken are few. Each harbors murderous poison, and the evil atmosphere is dark. They recklessly create things and defy heaven and earth."

*   "Love, desire, and glory cannot be permanently preserved. All will be separated, and there is nothing to enjoy. You should strive diligently to be born in the Land of Peace and Joy."

*   "Between heaven and earth, things naturally exist. Although there may not be immediate retribution, good and evil will eventually return to them."

*   "Between heaven and earth, the five paths are distinct. The retribution of good and evil, blessings and misfortunes, are passed down in succession. You bear them yourself; there is no one to take your place."

*   "What is the first thing to do? You should regulate your mind. You should regulate your body. Your ears, eyes, mouth, and nose should all be regulated. Your body and mind should be pure and clean, and in accordance with goodness."

*   "You should know that doubt is a great harm to all Bodhisattvas and a loss of great benefit. Therefore, you should clearly believe in the unsurpassed wisdom of all Buddhas."

*   "If you cultivate roots of virtue with non-form wisdom, and your body and mind are pure, far from discrimination, seeking rebirth in a Pure Land and heading toward Buddha's Bodhi, you will be born in a Buddha-land and forever attain liberation."

*   "If there are good men or good women who hear the name of Amitabha Buddha and can give rise to a single thought of delight, taking refuge and paying homage, practicing as taught, you should know that these people have obtained great benefit and will obtain the merits and virtues described above. Their minds will not be inferior, nor will they be arrogant. They will perfect roots of goodness, and all will increase. You should know that these people are not of the Small Vehicle. In my Dharma, they are called the foremost disciples."

**The Contemplation Sutra Spoken by the Buddha**

*   "Those who wish to be born in that country should cultivate the Three Fortunes.

    First, be filial to parents, serve teachers, have a compassionate heart and do not kill, and cultivate the Ten Wholesome Deeds.

    Second, accept and uphold the Three Refuges, be complete in all the precepts, and do not violate the rules of conduct.

    Third, arouse the Bodhi Mind, deeply believe in cause and effect, read and recite the Great Vehicle Sutras, and encourage others to practice."

    These three things are called Pure Karma.

    These three karmas are the right cause of pure karma of all Buddhas in the past, future, and present."

*   "The Buddhas, Tathagatas, are the Dharma-body, pervading the minds of all sentient beings. Therefore, when you think of the Buddha, your mind is the thirty-two marks and the eighty minor characteristics. This mind makes the Buddha; this mind is the Buddha."

*   "The Buddha's mind is great compassion. With unconditional compassion, he gathers in all sentient beings."

*   "Seeing Amitabha Buddha is to see the countless Buddhas in the ten directions."

*   "Reciting 'Namo Amitabha Buddha', because of reciting the Buddha's name, in each thought, the sins of eighty billion kalpas of birth and death are eliminated."

*   "If good men and good women only hear the Buddha's name and the names of the two Bodhisattvas, the sins of measureless kalpas of birth and death are eliminated. How much more so if they remember and recite. If they recite the Buddha, know that this person is a pundarika flower among people."

*   "You should well uphold these words. Upholding these words is upholding the name of Immeasurable Life Buddha."

**The Chapter on the Perfect Penetration of Great Strength Bodhisattva's Buddha-Recitation Samadhi in the Surangama Sutra**

*   "If sentient beings, with their minds, remember the Buddha and recite the Buddha, in the present and in the future, they will certainly see the Buddha and will not be far from the Buddha. Without resorting to expedients, they will naturally attain mental openness."

*   "When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, I had no choice. Gathering in the six senses and maintaining pure mindfulness in continuous succession, I attained samadhi. This is the foremost."

**The Chapter on the Conduct and Vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva in the Avatamsaka Sutra**

*   **The Ten Great Vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva**

    1.  To pay homage to all Buddhas.
    2.  To praise the Thus Come One.
    3.  To make extensive offerings.
    4.  To repent of karmic obstacles.
    5.  To rejoice in others' merits.
    6.  To request the turning of the Dharma Wheel.
    7.  To request the Buddhas to remain in the world.
    8.  To constantly learn from the Buddhas.
    9.  To always accord with sentient beings.
    10. To universally dedicate all merit.

*   "Repenting of karmic obstacles: A Bodhisattva thinks to himself, 'In the past, in beginningless kalpas, because of greed, anger, and ignorance, I have created all kinds of evil karma with my body, mouth, and mind. This is measureless and boundless. If this evil karma had substance and form, the exhaustion of space would not be able to contain it. Now, I will use my pure three karmas, pervading the realms of Dharma and the most minute dust motes, before all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, to sincerely repent, never creating them again, and constantly dwelling in pure precepts.'"

*   "If a Bodhisattva can accord with sentient beings, then it is according with and making offerings to all Buddhas. If you respect and serve sentient beings..."


To respect and serve the Thus Come One (Tathagata) is to make all beings happy, and to make all beings happy is to make all the Thus Come Ones happy.

※The Buddhas and Thus Come Ones take great compassion as their essence. They arise great compassion because of sentient beings. From great compassion, the Bodhi mind arises. From the Bodhi mind, perfect enlightenment is achieved.

※All the evil deeds I have committed in the past,
Are all due to beginningless greed, anger, and ignorance.
Arising from my body, speech, and mind,
I now repent of them all.

※May I, when approaching the end of my life,
Be rid of all obstacles,
See the face of that Buddha Amitabha,
And immediately be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

※The supreme and wondrous deeds of Samantabhadra I perform,
And all boundless blessings, I dedicate.
May all sentient beings who are drowning,
Swiftly go to the Buddha-land of Infinite Light.

II. Essence of Various Sutras

The Great Collection Sutra

※In the Dharma-Ending Age, billions practice, but scarcely one attains the Way. Only by relying on mindfulness of the Buddha, can one be delivered from birth and death.

※If a person simply recites Amitabha, this is called the unsurpassed, profound, and wondrous Chan.

※If there is no Buddha in the world, serving parents well is equivalent to serving the Buddha. Serving parents is serving the Buddha.

The Flower Adornment Sutra (Avatamsaka Sutra)

※Bodhisattvas of the ten stages never abandon mindfulness of the Buddha.

※Apart from the Bodhi mind, all actions become the deeds of demons.

※Precepts are the root of unsurpassed Bodhi, nurturing all good roots.

※The Bodhisattva's cool, clear moon, constantly roams the ultimate emptiness. When the defilements of sentient beings' minds are cleansed, the shadow of Bodhi appears.

※All sentient beings possess the wisdom and virtuous characteristics of the Thus Come One, but because of deluded thoughts and attachments, they cannot realize it. If they abandon deluded thoughts, all wisdom will immediately manifest.

※The sin of killing causes sentient beings to fall into the hells, the animal realm, and the realm of hungry ghosts. After suffering in the three evil paths, when reborn as humans, they still receive two kinds of retribution: a short life and much illness.

※Faith is the source of the Path and the mother of merit and virtue, increasing all good Dharmas, eliminating all doubts and uncertainties, and revealing and developing the unsurpassed Way.

※If one wishes to know the realm of the Buddha, purify one's mind like empty space.

※Bodhisattvas give away all possessions in charity, equally bestowing them on sentient beings, without expecting rewards or seeking fame.

The Brahma Net Sutra

※If a Buddha-disciple, out of compassion, engages in the act of liberating lives, knowing that all men are my fathers and all women are my mothers, from whom I have received birth in life after life, then all beings in the six realms are my parents. To kill and eat them is to kill my parents, and to kill my former body.

※All earth and water are my previous bodies, and all fire and wind are my fundamental essence. Therefore, constantly engage in liberating lives, receiving birth life after life, according to the constant Dharma. Teach people to liberate lives. If one sees people killing animals, one should skillfully protect and rescue them, relieving their suffering.

※Filial piety towards parents, teachers, and the Three Jewels is the ultimate path. Filial piety is called a precept.

※Bodhisattvas should give rise to the Buddha-nature, filial piety, compassion, and constantly help all people generate blessings and happiness.

※Bodhisattvas should give rise to constant and abiding compassion and filial piety, and skillfully protect and rescue all sentient beings.

※Bodhisattvas should bear insults and humiliations on behalf of all sentient beings, directing bad things to themselves and good things to others.

The Surangama Sutra

※Those who eat meat cannot accomplish the merit and virtue they seek.

※Disciplining the mind constitutes precepts. From precepts, concentration arises. From concentration, wisdom develops. These are called the three non-outflow studies.

※Among all practitioners in the world, there is no way to transcend the three realms without upholding the precepts.

※People eat sheep, and the sheep die and become people. People die and become sheep. Dying and being born, they eat each other. Evil karma accumulates, extending into the infinite future. You owe me your life, and I repay your debt. Because of this causal relationship, they remain in birth and death for hundreds and thousands of kalpas.

※You should teach the people of the world to cultivate samadhi, first by cutting off lust of the mind. This is the first, definitive, pure, and bright instruction of the Thus Come One, the Buddhas of the past.

※You should teach the people of the world to cultivate samadhi, next by cutting off killing. This is the second, definitive, pure, and bright instruction of the Thus Come One, the Buddhas of the past.

※You should teach the people of the world to cultivate samadhi, then by cutting off stealing. This is the third, definitive, pure, and bright instruction of the Thus Come One, the Buddhas of the past.

※You should teach the people of the world to cultivate samadhi, and finally by cutting off all great lies. This is the fourth, definitive, pure, and bright instruction of the Thus Come One, the Buddhas of the past.

※You should all know that these meat-eaters, even if their minds open and seem to attain samadhi, are all great rakshasas (demons). When their retribution ends, they will certainly sink into the bitter sea of birth and death. They are not disciples of the Buddha.

※If the ground of causation is not genuine, the result will be crooked.

The Sutra of Contemplating the Buddha Samadhi

※Manjushri Bodhisattva's verse: May I, when my life comes to an end, be rid of all obstacles, see the face of Amitabha Buddha, and be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

The Sutra of the Buddha's Last Teachings

※You should constantly feel shame and remorse, never ceasing. If you abandon shame and remorse, you will lose all merit and virtue.

※Those who feel shame possess good Dharmas. Those without shame are no different from birds and beasts.

The Diamond Sutra

※Bodhisattvas should give in this way, without dwelling on appearances. Why? If Bodhisattvas give without dwelling on appearances, their blessings and virtues are immeasurable.

※All appearances are illusory. If you see all appearances as non-appearances, you will see the Thus Come One.

※All sages and wise ones are differentiated by means of unconditioned Dharmas.

※One should give rise to a pure mind in this way, not dwelling on form to give rise to a mind, not dwelling on sound, smell, taste, touch, or Dharmas to give rise to a mind. One should give rise to a mind that dwells nowhere.

※Wherever this Sutra is, that place is where the Buddha is, along with the honored disciples.

※When faith is pure, the true mark arises.

※To be apart from all appearances is called the Buddhas.

※The Thus Come One is the speaker of truth, the speaker of reality, the speaker of what is as it is, the speaker of what is not false, and the speaker of what is not different.

※Good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this Sutra, if they are despised by others, it is because of karmic offenses from their past lives, which should have caused them to fall into evil paths. Because they are despised by others in this life, the karmic offenses from their past lives are thereby extinguished, and they will attain Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

※The past mind is unattainable, the present mind is unattainable, and the future mind is unattainable.

※This Dharma is equal, without high or low. It is called Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

※By cultivating all good Dharmas without the notion of self, person, sentient being, or life span, one attains Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

※All Dharmas are without self; thereby, patience is attained.

※Bodhisattvas should not be attached to the blessings and virtues they create. Therefore, it is said that they do not receive blessings and virtues.

※All conditioned Dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows; like dew and like lightning. You should contemplate them in this way.

The Nirvana Sutra

※The wise have two qualities: one is not creating evil deeds, and the other is repenting after having done them. The foolish also have two qualities: one is committing sins, and the other is concealing them.

※Those who eat meat sever the seed of great compassion.

※Rely on the Dharma, not on persons. Rely on the meaning, not on the words. Rely on wisdom, not on consciousness. Rely on the sutras of definitive meaning, not on the sutras of provisional meaning.

※In all the worlds, those who are born eventually die. Although life may be immeasurable, it will surely come to an end. Prosperity must decline, and meetings must lead to separations. There is no permanent Dharma; everything is in constant flux.

※If sentient beings do not protect and uphold the precepts, how can they see the Buddha-nature? Although all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature, they can only see it through upholding the precepts.

The Golden Light Sutra

※The golden light eliminates all evils. The most evil and heavy sins committed over thousands of kalpas, if one can sincerely repent of them even once, all such sins will be completely extinguished. I have now spoken of the Dharma of repentance. This golden light is pure and wondrous, and can quickly eliminate all karmic obstacles.

The Medicine Buddha Sutra

※Liberating all lives: illnesses can be cured, and all difficulties can be resolved.
Liberating lives and cultivating blessings: one can transcend suffering and adversity, and avoid all calamities.

The Lankavatara Sutra

※Eating meat is the same as killing.

※All sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been endlessly transmigrating in birth and death. Everyone has been our parents, siblings, sons, daughters, relatives, friends, loved ones, and servants. They easily take birth and receive bodies as birds and beasts. How can we kill and eat them?

A Sutra

※Abstaining from killing and liberating lives brings the reward of longevity. Also, abstaining from killing and liberating lives can resolve grievances and release knots, nurture compassionate hearts, and moisten the seeds of Bodhi.

The Sutra of Forty-Two Sections

※Serving the spirits of heaven and earth is not as good as being filial to one's parents. One's parents are the most divine.

※A Buddha-disciple who is thousands of miles away from me, if he remembers my precepts, will surely realize the Path. Though he is at my side and sees me often, if he does not follow my precepts, he will never attain the Path.

※The Buddha said: When evil people hear of good and deliberately come to disturb you, restrain yourself and do not be angry. The evil they bring will return to them.

The Great Treasure Trove Sutra

※It is better to endure the abuse and insults of the wise than to receive the praise of fools.

※The Thus Come Ones, the Buddhas, constantly turn the wheel of great compassion. Why? Because the Thus Come Ones, the Buddhas, do not abandon any sentient being.

The Lotus Sutra

※The Buddhas speak with one voice; there is only one vehicle, not two. They further use various expedient means to assist in revealing the ultimate truth.

The Moon Lamp Samadhi Sutra

※Giving is the vanguard in breaking through stinginess and greed, and the first gate to entering the right path.

The Great Skillful Means Sutra of Repaying Kindness to the Buddha

※Parents and the Sangha are the two fields of blessings for all sentient beings, from which the wondrous fruits of human and heavenly realms, Nirvana, and liberation are attained.

※The Sangha is the field of blessings that transcends the three realms. Parents are the most supreme field of blessings within the three realms.

The Mahavairocana Sutra

※The Buddhadharma takes the Bodhi mind as its proper cause and great compassion as its foundation.

The Upasaka Precept Sutra

※A compassionate mind is the cause and condition for all happiness.

The Long Agama Sutra

※Givers obtain blessings. Those with compassion have no enemies. Those who do good eliminate evil. Those who are detached from desire have no afflictions.

The Miscellaneous Treasure Sutra

※Little bad actions done to parents result in great suffering. Little offerings made to parents result in immeasurable blessings. You should learn this and diligently devote yourself to serving your parents.

The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment

※Lust and desire are the root of birth and death.

The Sutra on Mindfulness of the True Dharma

※The King of Death swallows sentient beings. Decay and old age drink away youth. Sickness arrives and health diminishes. The world is ignorant of this.

※The foremost, supreme mindfulness is mindfulness of death. By constantly being mindful of death, one cherishes fear and dread. Because of fear and dread, one does not create evil karma.

The Earth Store (Ksitigarbha) Sutra

※If there are sentient beings who are not filial to their parents, even to the point of killing them, they will fall into the uninterrupted hell (Avici hell) for billions of kalpas, with no hope of escape.

※If there are sentient beings who draw blood from the Buddha's body, slander the Three Jewels, or disrespect the sutras, they will also fall into the Avici hell for billions of kalpas, with no hope of escape.

※If there are men and women who do not perform good deeds, who commit evil, or who do not believe in cause and effect, who engage in sexual misconduct and false speech, who engage in divisive speech and harsh speech, or who slander the Great Vehicle, such sentient beings will certainly fall into evil destinies.

※When one is about to die, parents and relatives should perform meritorious deeds on their behalf to aid them on their journey.

※If they can further create all kinds of good deeds within the seven weeks following their death, they can enable those sentient beings to permanently leave the evil destinies and be reborn in the realms of humans and gods, enjoying supreme and wondrous bliss. The living relatives will receive immeasurable benefits.

※On the day sentient beings die, be careful not to kill or create evil conditions, offer sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, or seek help from demons and goblins. Why? Because these killings and sacrifices will not benefit the deceased in the slightest, but will only create karmic ties and increase their suffering.

※When one is about to die, there are also hundreds of thousands of evil-path ghosts and spirits, who may transform into one's parents or relatives, to lead the dying person into evil paths.

※The relatives should make great offerings, recite the honored sutras, and chant the names of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Such good conditions can enable the deceased to leave all evil paths, and all demons and ghosts will retreat.

※When all sentient beings are about to die, if they hear the name of a Buddha, the name of a Bodhisattva, or a verse from a Great Vehicle sutra, I observe that such people, except for those who have committed the five unpardonable sins of killing their father, mother, Arhat, disrupting the Sangha and causing a Buddha to bleed, will be immediately liberated from smaller evil karmas that would cause them to fall into evil destinies.

※All sentient beings in the present and future, whether gods, humans, men, or women, can attain immeasurable merit and virtue by simply reciting the name of one Buddha. How much more so by reciting many names! Such sentient beings will receive great benefits during their lives and at the time of death, and will never fall into evil destinies.

※If, when a person is about to die, their family members, even just one person, loudly recites the name of one Buddha for the dying person, that dying person will have the five unpardonable sins and other karmic retributions completely extinguished.

The Great Treatise on Wisdom (Mahaprajnaparamita Sastra)

※Among all sins, killing is the heaviest. Among all meritorious deeds, liberating lives is the foremost.

※The Buddhadharma values practice, not non-practice. If one can diligently practice, even with little learning, one will enter the Path sooner.

※The great matter of adorning a Buddha-land cannot be accomplished by individual effort alone; one must have vows. It is like a strong ox that can pull a cart, but still needs a driver to reach its destination.

※If one abandons shame and remorse, one will lose all merit and virtue. Those who feel shame possess good Dharmas. Those without shame are no different from birds and beasts.

The Book of Events (Avadana Sutra)

※Even if someone were to carry his father on one shoulder and his mother on the other, and never leave them for the duration of their lives, providing them with clothing, food, medicine, and all their needs, they still would not be able to repay the deep kindness of their parents.

The Sutra of Contemplating the Mind Ground

※All men and women are happy because of the kindness of their compassionate father and mother in raising them. The kindness of a compassionate father is as high as a mountain king, and the kindness of a sorrowful mother is as deep as the ocean.

※When parents are alive, it is called wealth. When parents are not alive, it is called poverty. When parents are alive, it is called midday. When parents are gone, it is called the dark of night. Therefore, you should diligently cultivate and practice filial piety towards your parents. If one makes offerings to the Buddha, the blessings are the same, without difference.

The Sutra of the Sayings of the Law (Dhammapada)

※Even if one devotes one's entire life to diligently serving the gods of the world, sacrificing elephants and horses to the heavens, it is not as good as practicing one act of loving-kindness.

The Sutra of Unborn Enemies

※The greatest of good is nothing greater than filial piety. The greatest of evils is harming one's parents.

The Sutra of Impermanence

※Even if Mount Sumeru crumbles at the end of a kalpa, the deep and bottomless ocean will also dry up. The earth, the sun, and the moon will all return to nothing when the time comes. There has never been a single Dharma that has not been swallowed by impermanence.

The Sutra of Eight Great Realizations of Great Beings

※Having many desires is suffering. The fatigue of birth and death arises from greed and desire. Having few desires is non-action, and the body and mind are at ease.

The Sutra of Causes and Conditions of a Thousand Buddhas as Spoken by the Buddha

※Giving is a wondrous collection, receiving infinite rewards. All gods and humans are established because of giving. Therefore, the wise should practice giving.

The Buddha's Sutra on Healing the Body

※If one's own body is properly taught, it is not difficult to teach others. To teach others, one must first teach oneself.

The Sutra of Avalokitesvara (Guanyin)

※The Bodhi mind is the mind of great enlightenment, the mind of equality, and the mind of universality.

The Agamas

※If there is no love and attachment in the world, there will be no worries, sufferings, defilements, or afflictions. All worries and sufferings are completely extinguished, like a lotus flower that does not adhere to water.

III. The Essence of Teachings from Successive Generations of Patriarchs

Teachings of Great Master Shandao

※Gradually, one's skin becomes wrinkled like chicken skin, and one's hair turns white as a crane's. Soon, one's steps become faltering and slow. Even if one has halls filled with gold and jade, one cannot escape the decline of old age and illness. No matter how much happiness you have, impermanence will surely arrive. Only the direct path of cultivation, simply reciting Amitabha Buddha, is the way.

※The Great Sage (Buddha) pities us and directly urges us to exclusively recite the Name, precisely because reciting the Name is easy. Continuous recitation ensures rebirth (in the Pure Land). If one can recite continuously, making it the goal of one's life, then ten out of ten will be reborn, a hundred out of a hundred will be reborn.

※When ordinary people are about to die, they must not fear death. Constantly think that this body is full of suffering and impurity. If one can relinquish this illusory body and be reborn in a good realm, that is a desirable thing.

※When one is ill, simply contemplate impermanence and await death with a single mind.

※If one abandons exclusive recitation and engages in miscellaneous practices, scarcely one or two out of a hundred will be reborn, or three or four out of a thousand.

※This is truly the essential path to entering Buddhahood. Cultivating other practices is circuitous and difficult to accomplish. Only this Dharma-door quickly transcends birth and death.

※Someone asked: "Does reciting the Buddha lead to rebirth in the Pure Land?" The Master replied: "As you recite, so will your wish be fulfilled."

※"Namo" means taking refuge, and also signifies making a vow and dedicating the merit. "Amitabha Buddha" signifies the practice. Because of this meaning, one will certainly attain rebirth (in the Pure Land).

Teachings of Great Master Yongming Yanshou

※Four Classifications

To have Chan without Pure Land, nine out of ten go astray.
When the realm of the skandhas appears, they are instantly led away by others.

To have Pure Land without Chan, ten thousand cultivate and ten thousand go.
Simply by seeing Amitabha, what need is there to worry about not attaining enlightenment?

To have both Chan and Pure Land is like a tiger with horns.
In this life, one is a teacher of people; in the next life, one will be a Buddha-ancestor.

To have neither Chan nor Pure Land, one ends up on a bed of iron with pillars of copper.
For myriad kalpas and thousands of lifetimes, there is no one to rely on.

※For those who are truly cultivating, and genuinely wish to be born in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss, wholeheartedly and earnestly recite the phrase "Amitabha Buddha."

This single thought is my original teacher.
This single thought is the transformation-body Buddha.
This single thought is the fierce general who breaks open the hells.
This single thought is the precious sword that slays the hordes of demons.
This single thought is the direct path out of the three realms.
This single thought is the bright lamp that illuminates the darkness.
This single thought is the compassionate boat that crosses the sea of suffering.
This single thought is the good medicine that escapes birth and death.
This single thought is the Amitabha of our inherent nature.
This single thought is the Pure Land of the mind alone.

Simply remember to keep the phrase "Amitabha Buddha" in your heart, and do not let it be lost. Keep it constantly present in every thought, never letting it leave your mind. Recite in this way whether there is something to do or not, whether you are happy or suffering, whether you are living or dying. Recite in this way, clearly and without confusion. Why ask others and search for a path home?

Teachings of Great Master Lianchi Zhuhong

※Birth and death is a great matter.

※I only know how to recite the Buddha, I have no other skills.

※Nagarjuna chanted the Avatamsaka Sutra in the Dragon Palace and vowed to be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Samantabhadra is the eldest son of the Avatamsaka Sutra and vowed to be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Manjushri and Samantabhadra together assist Vairochana, and are known as the Three Saints of the Avatamsaka Sutra, yet they vowed to be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. There is clear evidence for all of this, as bright as the sun and stars.

※As for those who are clever and eloquent, and idly talk about Prajna (wisdom), eating their fill of meat and then coming to monks to discuss Chan, they are demons! I am content to be a simple and foolish old man. I would rather be an old lay-man or old lay-woman who observes the precepts than an old demon-man or old demon-woman.

※Everyone should sincerely recite the Buddha. Do not be strange or eccentric, and do not break my rules.

※Scattered thoughts are the illness; reciting the Buddha is the medicine. Reciting the Buddha is the right treatment for scattered thoughts, and if it doesn't work, it's because the recitation is not sincere enough. When scattered thoughts arise, put your mind to it and recite more diligently, with each word and phrase focused and unified. The scattered thoughts will naturally cease.

※When myriad thoughts are flying about, that is the very time to do the work. Gather them in and they scatter, then scatter them and gather them in. After a long time, when the practice becomes pure and skilled, wandering thoughts will naturally not arise.

※Those who study Buddhism should value genuine practice, regardless of outer forms.

Lay practitioners do not necessarily need to wear black robes and a Daoist head covering. Those who still have hair can recite the Buddha in ordinary clothes. One does not necessarily need to beat drums and gongs. Quiet people can recite the Buddha silently. One does not necessarily need to join groups and assemblies. Those who are afraid of trouble can recite the Buddha behind closed doors. One does not necessarily need to go to temples to listen to sutras. Literate people can recite the Buddha according to the teachings.

※Burning incense a thousand miles away is not as good as sitting at home and reciting the Buddha.
Making offerings to heretical teachers is not as good as being filial to your parents and reciting the Buddha.
Making friends with demonic companions is not as good as being alone and pure, and reciting the Buddha.
Storing up merit for the next life is not as good as creating blessings now, and reciting the Buddha.
Making vows and seeking protection is not as good as repenting and reforming yourself, and reciting the Buddha.
Studying externalist writings is not as good as reciting the Buddha even if you can't read a single word.
Ignorantly talking about Chan principles is not as good as honestly upholding the precepts and reciting the Buddha.
Hoping for psychic powers from demons and ghosts is not as good as having right faith in cause and effect and reciting the Buddha.

※Chan Master Bianrong instructed Great Master Lianchi: "You should keep to your duties, do not be greedy for fame and profit, do not engage in climbing social ladders. Just be clear about cause and effect, and recite the Buddha single-mindedly."

※What the Great Collection of Sutras elucidates is nothing more than precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Reciting the Buddha is precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Why bother following the words and phrases to read this collection of sutras? Time passes quickly, and life is impermanent. May everyone take Pure Land practice as their urgent task.

※I am an inferior ordinary person, content to be simple and foolish. My lifelong task is simply the six words "Namo Amitabha Buddha." Now that I am old, if anyone asks me, I will certainly answer in this way.

※Wandering thoughts are the illness; reciting the Buddha is the medicine. A chronic illness cannot be cured by a single pill, and accumulated wandering thoughts cannot be eliminated by temporary recitation. Don't worry about wandering thoughts flying about; just value reciting the Buddha sincerely and earnestly.

※Illnesses mostly come from killing, so it is important to liberate lives extensively.

※A family that abstains from killing is protected by good spirits. Disasters and accidents are eliminated, life is prolonged, children and grandchildren are virtuous and filial, and there are all kinds of auspicious signs that are difficult to describe in detail. If one further liberates lives according to one's ability, and adds the power of reciting the Buddha, not only will one increase one's merit and virtue, but one will certainly be reborn according to one's vows, permanently escaping reincarnation and entering the stage of non-retrogression.

※The most important thing in the world is life, and the most tragic thing in the world is killing and injury.

※All giving has its reward, and nothing happens without a cause. It is recorded in the texts and is clear to our ears and eyes. May everyone, upon seeing any living being, give rise to a compassionate heart, donate impermanent wealth, and perform expedient deeds. To benefit many lives is to accumulate great unseen merit. Even to benefit a single insect is a good deed.

※Those who liberate lives may increase their blessings and prosperity, prolong their lifespans, avoid sudden disasters, recover from chronic illnesses, be born in heaven, or realize the fruits of the Path. Rewards are obtained according to one's giving, and all have evidence. However, those who do good and bring about auspiciousness do so with the mind of a Daoist; how can they expect a reward? Not expecting a reward, yet the reward comes naturally, because cause and effect are inevitable, and it cannot be declined. Those who liberate lives should know this.

※If the heart is great and the virtue is deep, how can the effects be examined? To benefit others is the practice of a Bodhisattva. Using this practice to aid in the cultivation of the Path is like a boat with a favorable wind, which will surely reach the shore of Nirvana quickly. The three blessings of Pure Land practice include not killing out of loving-kindness as one of the practices. Now, if one can refrain from killing and also liberate lives, and further use Dharma to help them be reborn in the Pure Land, with such a mind, when the reward is complete, one will undoubtedly take great strides on the nine grades of lotus platforms. I sincerely urge the people of the world not to disbelieve my words simply because my virtue is shallow and my knowledge is limited.

※I sincerely urge the people of the world to give rise to a compassionate heart upon seeing any living being, and to donate worldly wealth to do this as an expedient means.

※The Brahma Net Sutra considers liberating lives as an abiding Dharma. Abiding means a diamond body and immeasurable life.

※I inform everyone that while your parents are alive, you should encourage them to recite the Buddha. On the anniversary of their death, dedicate three years of reciting the Buddha on their behalf. Those who cannot do that can do it for one year or for forty-nine days. A filial son who wishes to repay the kindness of his parents should not fail to know this.

※When parents are freed from defilement, the path of the child is then accomplished.

※Teaching people to liberate lives enables them to awaken to the principle of life without end, and to obtain the diamond body of immeasurable life.

Teachings of Great Master Ouyi Zhixu

※The Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha is nothing special; it only requires deep faith, earnest vows, and diligent practice.

※If you recite Amitabha Buddha until you are skilled at it, the Three Storehouses and Twelve Divisions of scriptures, the ultimate doctrines and principles, are all contained within it. The seventeen hundred koans and the upward-pointing opportunity are also contained within it. The three thousand dignified behaviors, the eighty-thousand subtle practices, and the three pure precepts are also contained within it.

※To truly be able to recite the Buddha and let go of body, mind, and world is the great giving.
To truly be able to recite the Buddha and no longer give rise to greed, anger, and ignorance is the great upholding of precepts.
To truly be able to recite the Buddha and not remember the rights and wrongs of others or one's self is the great patience and forbearance.


Truly capable of reciting the Buddha's name without interruption or admixture is true great diligence.
Truly capable of reciting the Buddha's name without wandering thoughts is true great samadhi.
Truly capable of reciting the Buddha's name without being misled by other paths is true great wisdom.

※ To be capable of upholding is initial enlightenment. What is upheld is original enlightenment. Now, directly uphold it; outside of upholding, there is no Buddha; outside of Buddha, there is no upholding. When the capable and the upheld are not two, then initial enlightenment merges with original enlightenment, which is ultimate enlightenment.

※ From beginningless time until the end of the future, we will never be without arising thoughts. Even if our minds become like stagnant ashes and we enter non-thinking samadhi, we will still fall into eighty-four thousand withered and chaotic thoughts. If we think of hell, we are beings of the hell realm. If we think of hungry ghosts, we are beings of the hungry ghost realm. Similarly, if we think of the Buddha, we are beings of the Buddha-dharma realm. This principle is very clear. Therefore, the *Zongjing Lu* (Record of the Source Mirror) says, "One thought in accordance is one thought of Buddha; thought after thought in accordance is thought after thought of Buddha."

※ A great virtuous one asked me about the essence of mind. I replied, "Nothing is better than reciting the Buddha's name for the essence of mind."

※ If a person single-mindedly recites Amitabha Buddha's name, it is called the unsurpassed, profound, and wondrous Chan (Zen).
When one sincerely imagines seeing the Buddha, that is the dharma of non-birth and non-death.

※ The Samadhi of Buddha Recitation is called the King of Treasures Samadhi, the king among samadhis. All samadhis, whether partial or complete, provisional or real, flow from this samadhi and return to its door. It is the essential point of the most complete and sudden teachings and also a skillful and convenient means that universally benefits all three capacities.

※ This Dharma-door of Name Recitation, although seemingly tailored for those of middling and lower capacity, is still the most sudden and complete. The name that is recited, whether understood or not, is intrinsically none other than one realm and three truths. The mind that recites, whether realized or not, is intrinsically none other than one mind and three contemplations.

※ Name is the dharma-realm, the Middle Way, and the Real Mark. Picking up one is picking up everything. There is not a single dharma outside of the name.

※ Killing living beings is killing all future Buddhas within your own mind. Releasing living beings is releasing all future Buddhas within your own mind. If you release all future Buddhas within your own mind, it is true Buddha-Recitation Samadhi. Cultivating this Buddha-Recitation Samadhi is constantly turning hundreds of thousands of millions of volumes of the Lotus Sutra.

※ If you wish to realize the Buddha's mind from the human mind and transform the kalpa of turbidity into a pure land, nothing is more effective than releasing living beings. The practice of releasing living beings should be expanded and continued. A cup of water cannot save a cartload of burning firewood, only if everyone provides a cup of water. If one cup is not enough, then another. When there are many cups of water, there is no fire that cannot be extinguished. Now, the calamities of killing are rampant, brought about by shared evil karma. If not for the water of compassionate samadhi, what can extinguish it?

※ Regard all kinds of adverse and rebellious circumstances as places of genuine benefit. Regard all kinds of agreeable circumstances, such as fame, profit, sensual pleasures, food, praise, and offerings, as poison and poisoned arrows.

※ When people talk about birth and death, they rarely don't feel alarmed. But often, they cannot truly resolve the matter of birth and death because they cannot let go of their current livelihood. The reason they cannot let go is that they have not thoroughly seen the suffering of birth and death.

※ If people can keenly remember that birth and death are important matters and see through all worldly affairs, whether favorable or unfavorable, as false and unreal, fleeting like empty flowers, then they can live and die with one mind dedicated to upholding precepts, repentance, performing prostrations, and having firm faith in the Triple Jewel.

※ Focus on finding your own faults and do not blame others.

※ Why not let go of illusory dreams and worldly toil early and diligently cultivate precepts, samadhi, and wisdom?

※ Within the triple realm, there is nothing that is not a prison. Temporary happiness ultimately leads to impermanence.

※ Extremely intelligent people are often misled by their own intelligence, and therefore cannot recite the Buddha's name and seek rebirth in the West. Conversely, foolish women are willing to deeply detest the suffering of Saha and earnestly seek liberation. You should know that they are truly foolish, while the former have great wisdom. It is easy to distinguish good from bad, do not deceive yourself.

※ Just deeply and sincerely uphold precepts and recite the Buddha's name. If you uphold them purely and recite them earnestly, you will naturally believe wholeheartedly. This is what is meant by using different expedient means to help reveal the supreme truth.

※ The more learning, the more arrogant one becomes. The more habits grow, the farther one is from the Path. It is frightening to only increase learning and augment one's own views.

※ If worldly sentiments diminish by one part, then the Dharma will naturally gain one part of strength. If attachment to the Saha world lightens by one part, then rebirth in the West will become one part more secure. This matter only requires asking one's own heart, there is no need to ask scholars.

※ Constantly thinking of illness diminishes worldly thoughts;
Constantly thinking of death generates thoughts of the Path.

※ The Dharma declines not because of a lack of external protectors, but because of a lack of internal guardians.

※ If one becomes slightly involved with worldly fame and profit, the Buddhadharma will become worldly dharma, which is deeply lamentable.

※ If you wish to become a sage, virtuous person, or Buddha ancestor, you must accept abuse as if drinking sweet dew and encounter adversity as if obtaining a priceless treasure.

※ Take upholding precepts as the foundation, take the Pure Land as the destination, take contemplation as the key, and rely on virtuous friends.

※ Snap your fingers and return to the Land of Peace; the Jambudvipa world is not worth staying in.

※ Take refuge in the Great Compassionate Father, and quickly escape the Saha gate.

※ The method of counting is universally beneficial to all three capacities. Those of higher capacity are not hindered by counting, while those of lower capacity must count. Therefore, everything is measured by numbers, so that those who are sharp can achieve oneness, and those who are dull will not lose the good root of karmic cause. If one relies on the principle that all things are one and does not need to count, then I fear that there will be fewer of higher intelligence and more of lower foolishness, and few will not forget.

※ Repentance, dedication, and then reciting the Buddha's name, there is nothing that will not be accomplished.

※ Among all the Buddha-Recitation Dharma-doors, the simplest and most reliable is to have faith, make vows, and single-mindedly uphold the name. There is no need for contemplation or investigation.

※ Just single-mindedly uphold the name, without being of two minds. Deeply believe that the Pure Land can be born in, make a vow to definitely be reborn there, taking upholding the name as the primary practice and the six perfections as the auxiliary practice. Ten thousand practice, and ten thousand go. It can certainly be guaranteed.

※ When the Buddhadharma is flourishing, people strive to be practical. When it declines, all compete for fame. Therefore, to transcend birth and death and realize Bodhi, vying for fame inevitably causes conflict and increases demonic karma. Aspirants must examine this thoroughly.

**Essence of the Essential Explanation of the Amitabha Sutra**

※ Among all expedient means, the most direct and complete is reciting the Buddha's name and seeking rebirth in the Pure Land.

※ Among all the Buddha-Recitation Dharma-doors, the simplest and most reliable is to have faith, make vows, and single-mindedly uphold the name.

※ Faith, vows, and upholding the name are the essential points of practice. Without faith, one cannot arouse vows. Without vows, one cannot guide practice. Without the wondrous practice of upholding the name, one cannot fulfill what is vowed and realize what is believed.

※ Miao Zong says: "If taking and rejecting are carried to the extreme, it is not different from not taking and not rejecting. If one does not engage in taking and rejecting, but only values not taking and not rejecting, that is clinging to principle and abandoning practice. If practice is abandoned, principle will not be complete either."

※ The name summons virtue. Virtue is inconceivable, therefore the name is also inconceivable. The merit and virtue of the name are inconceivable, therefore random recitation plants the seed of Buddhahood, and diligent upholding leads to non-retrogression.

※ Only the method of upholding the name is most universally receptive and easiest to begin.

※ In the future, when the scriptures disappear, this scripture will be specially kept in the world for a hundred years to widely liberate sentient beings. It is an *agada* medicine, holding all diseases, absolutely complete and harmonious, and inconceivable.

※ The hidden treasures of the *Avatamsaka Sutra* (Flower Garland Sutra), the secret essence of the *Lotus Sutra*, the essential points of all Buddhas, and the compass for the myriad practices of Bodhisattvas, all do not go beyond this.

※ Whether one is reborn or not depends entirely on whether one has faith and vows. The level of one's rank depends entirely on the depth of one's name recitation.

※ Amitabha, literally translated, means immeasurable. It is fundamentally unspeakable. The original teacher uses the two meanings of light and life to encompass all immeasurable qualities. Light pervades the ten directions horizontally, and life extends through the three periods of time vertically. The intersection of horizontal and vertical is the essence of the dharma realm, and this essence constitutes Amitabha's body and land, which is also to say this essence constitutes Amitabha's name.

※ Amitabha's name is the original enlightened rationality of sentient beings. Upholding the name is the merging of initial enlightenment with original enlightenment. Initial and original are not two, and sentient beings and Buddhas are not two. Therefore, one thought in accordance is one thought of Buddha; thought after thought in accordance is thought after thought of Buddha.

※ In Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings, only the *Avatamsaka Sutra* clearly explains complete enlightenment in one lifetime. And the cause of complete enlightenment in one lifetime is the *Chapter on the Practices and Vows of Samantabhadra* at the end, where the ten great vows lead to rebirth in the Land of Peace, and this is used to encourage the assemblies in the Lotus Treasury Sea.

※ What the *Avatamsaka Sutra* relies on is actually within this sutra.

※ Believe in the Buddha's power to deeply believe in the merit and virtue of the name. Believe in upholding the name to deeply believe that our mind-nature is intrinsically inconceivable. Only this deep belief can lead to great vows.

※ Deep faith and making vows is the unsurpassed Bodhi. Combining this faith and vows is truly the guide to the Pure Land.

※ If faith and vows are firm, even ten recitations or one recitation at the time of death will definitely lead to rebirth. If there is no faith or vows, even if the name is recited to the point where the wind cannot penetrate and the rain cannot wet, like a silver wall or iron barrier, there is no reason for rebirth.

※ Amitabha Buddha is a name of ten thousand virtues. Using the name to summon virtue, nothing is left out. Therefore, just uphold the name as the primary practice. There is no need to engage in contemplation or investigation. It is the simplest and most direct.

※ Faith, vows, and practice are not sequential, nor are they fixed as three. Without vows and practice, it is not true faith. Without practice and faith, it is not true vows. Without faith and vows, it is not true practice.

※ Faith, vows, and practice are all completely present in every sound. Therefore, it is called many good roots, meritorious virtues, and karmic causes. The *Contemplation Sutra* says, "Because one calls the Buddha's name, in every thought, one eliminates the sins of eighty billion kalpas of birth and death." This is what it means.

※ The Dharma-door is profound and subtle, destroying all frivolous arguments and severing all opinions. Only those like Ashvaghosa, Nagarjuna, Zhiyi, and Yongming can thoroughly bear this burden. All worldly wisdom, cleverness, learned scholars, and Chan practitioners, if they try to fathom it with thought, will go further and further astray. It is not as good as foolish men, women, and old people who honestly recite the Buddha's name, for they can secretly connect with the Buddha's wisdom and implicitly accord with the mystery of the Path.

※ This sutra is only the realm of Buddhas, and only Buddhas can circulate it.

※ Upholding the name of one Buddha is being protected and remembered by all Buddhas, not different from upholding the names of all Buddhas.

※ Vows are the condensation of faith and the pivot of practice. They are especially important. By raising vows, faith and practice are included within them. Therefore, it is diligently advised three times.

※ One sound of Amitabha Buddha is the unsurpassed *anuttara-samyak-sambodhi* dharma obtained by Shakyamuni Buddha in the five turbidities and evil world.

※ Now, this fruition-enlightenment is entirely bestowed upon sentient beings in the turbid and evil world. This is the realm traversed by all Buddhas, which only Buddhas can fully understand, and which the nine realms cannot believe or understand through their own power.

**Instruction from Great Master Xing Ce**

※ There is no essential method for cultivation other than to generate genuine faith and vows, and single-mindedly and dedicatedly recite the Buddha's name. Then all conduct will not need to be altered.

※ Zen Master Zhenxie said: "Buddhas hand down, and ancestors transmit, only this one matter; there is nothing else. The World Honored One spoke the Dharma for forty-nine years in over three hundred assemblies, but only praised and explained the Pure Land teachings with earnestness. Is this not a shortcut to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred?"

※ All of my fellow practitioners should deeply remember the dangers of the Saha world and quickly seek to escape the six paths, abandoning the impure and taking the pure. Do not pursue empty fame, do not cling to empty views, do not be confused by the verbal samadhi of Chan monks who flatter, and do not seek quick results, stirring up demonic affairs. Constantly take Buddha recitation as the primary practice, diligently cultivate various good deeds as auxiliary practices, maintain pure thoughts continuously, and support each other with vows and practice. Naturally, everything will be secure and reliable.

※ If you do not single-mindedly recite the Buddha's name and seek rebirth in that country, you will inevitably be carried along by your karma and suffer immeasurable pain.

※ Single-mindedly recite the Buddha's name to seek swift rebirth in the Land of Peace.

※ At the end of the *Avatamsaka Sutra*, the ten great vows lead to rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, only desiring to be born in the Land of Peace and only vowing to see Amitabha Buddha. The earnest exhortations and repeated instructions are all contained in the *Chapter on the Practices and Vows of Samantabhadra*.

※ Singlemindedly recite Amitabha Buddha of the West, dedicate all good roots, and make vows. You will definitely be reborn, never regress, and draw near to Amitabha.

※ Amitabha Buddha is the embodiment of the dharma realm. The Land of Ultimate Bliss is the ocean of the Lotus Treasury. Seeing one Buddha is seeing countless Buddhas. Being born in one land is being born in countless lands. Reciting one Buddha is reciting all Buddhas, and is being protected and remembered by all Buddhas. Because the Dharma body is not two, sentient beings and Buddhas are not two, and the capable and upheld are not two.

※ Possess genuine vows and generate joyful vows. View the three realms as a prison, view the home as shackles, view sounds and colors as poisonous, view fame and profit as reins, view the ups and downs of decades as a dream of yesterday, and view one lifetime in the Saha world as staying in an inn. Believe in quickly abandoning it, and only with one mind recite the Buddha's name, vowing to be born together in the Pure Land.

※ Like a prisoner going to the market, every step is closer to death, you must diligently day and night, strenuously in the heat and cold, and continuously recite the great name, without pause. Rebirth in the Pure Land can definitely be achieved, be careful not to start strong and end weak.

※ Only seek to leave the Saha world; do not seek worldly blessings, merits, wisdom, eloquence, or understanding. Do not make vows to be a monk lifetime after lifetime and to make the Buddhadharma flourish. Only vow that at the end of life you will be reborn in that country and escape the suffering of birth and death.

※ The key to upholding the name is to be single-minded and undisturbed, without interruption or admixture, not necessarily striving for fast recitation or many recitations as superior. Simply recite neither too slowly nor too quickly, closely and continuously, so that the Buddha's name is clearly and distinctly present in the mind. While dressing, eating, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, maintain a continuous flow of the great name. Such name-recitation can be called single-minded and diligent in practice!

※ The Buddha-Recitation Dharma-door relies on the superior power of that Buddha's vows, so that regardless of whether one is wise or not, of high, middle, or low capacity, as long as one upholds the name and is single-minded and undisturbed, for seven days or even one day, one will have many good roots, meritorious virtues, and karmic causes, be received and guided by Amitabha Buddha and the holy assembly, and be protected and remembered by all Buddhas in the ten directions. This is an inconceivable and different expedient means, and it is superior because it is different.

※ This most superior and different Dharma-door, Shakyamuni earnestly showed and exhorted, and the Tathagatas of the Ganges River sands praised extensively. How could they deceive us?

※ The Buddhadharma has countless doors, some difficult and some easy. If you want easy practice and quick attainment, you should recite the Buddha's name, calling upon Amitabha Buddha, to quickly attain unsurpassed Bodhi.

※ In the five turbidities and evil world, seeking *avaivartika* (non-retrogression) is very difficult. If one believes in the Buddha-Recitation Samadhi and relies on the power of that Buddha's vows to embrace and guide, one will definitely be reborn. Without relying on expedient means, one will naturally open one's mind, be non-regressing in every life, and the Buddha-stage can be expected.

※ The Pure Land broadly encompasses all roots and enables all to ascend to non-retrogression.

※ You should remember that time is fleeting like a swift current and old age is approaching daily. Do not waste your good fortune. Besides the fixed daily practice, simply add more recitation of the Buddha's name. Mantras like the Shurangama Mantra and the Great Compassion Mantra are not necessary for temporary travel.

※ If affection and love become one part less, Pure Land karma will mature one part more.

※ The sutra says: "The sea of the Buddhas' right and complete knowledge arises from the mind's thought." When sentient beings' minds think of the Buddha, that mind is the thirty-two marks and eighty minor excellences. That mind becomes the Buddha, and that mind is the Buddha. These few words are the secret essence of Buddha-Recitation Samadhi. All contemplation doors flow from this.

※ The Great Collection Sutra says: "If a person only recites Amitabha Buddha's name, it is called unsurpassed, profound, and wondrous Chan." "When one sincerely imagines seeing the Buddha, that is the dharma of non-birth and non-death."

※ Zen Master Zhijue said: "One thought in accordance is one thought of Buddha; thought after thought in accordance is thought after thought of Buddha."

※ Buddha is the principle of original enlightenment; recitation is the wisdom of initial enlightenment. Therefore, know that when one is correctly reciting the Buddha's name, initial and original combine, principle and wisdom merge, the capable and upheld are both forgotten, and self and others are not two. There is no Buddha outside of the recitation for the recitation to uphold, and there is no recitation outside of the Buddha to recite the Buddha. Transcending emotion and exceeding views, separate from words and beyond right and wrong, most direct and complete, nothing surpasses this. Besides reciting the Buddha's name, is there any other wondrous contemplation that can be accomplished?

※ How much light remains? The most reliable and easy path is only to encourage others with the six-character true words. This is a miraculous prescription from the sea, able to cure acute illnesses, treating both the root and branch, suitable for both urgent and gradual cases. What is important is deep faith, vigorous practice, and dedicated upholding.

※ The various sutras extensively praise the Pure Land, saying: "Inconceivable merit and virtue," "A dharma difficult for the world to believe," "Protected and remembered by all Buddhas," "Unsurpassed, profound, and wondrous Chan," "Superior and different expedient means," "The king among samadhis," etc. But sentient beings of the degenerate age tend to be suspicious of the Buddha-Recitation Dharma-door, even destroying others' pure faith and obstructing their good deeds. People with little merit and little wisdom often have such habitual tendencies.

※ Quiet and detached, relying on things as if lodging, constantly fasting and serving the Buddha, living simply without desires, cultivating and inquiring about the Path.

※ If a practitioner does not have right faith and seeks rebirth in the West while broadly cultivating various good deeds, it is called the third-generation enemy.

**Instruction from Great Master Che Wu**

※ Truly resolve birth and death, generate the Bodhi mind, and with deep faith and vows, uphold the Buddha's name. These sixteen characters are the great outline and essence of the Buddha-Recitation Dharma-door.

※ If the mind to truly resolve birth and death is not generated, all instructions are merely frivolous talk.

※ Resolve birth and death as if losing parents, as if saving your head from burning.

※ Once the great mind has been generated, one should cultivate great practice. And among all practice doors, the easiest to start, the easiest to accomplish, the most reliable, and the most complete is nothing other than to uphold the Buddha's name with deep faith and vows.

※ The so-called upholding the name means to cherish it wholeheartedly, holding it firmly in the mind and never forgetting it. If there is even a moment of interruption, it is not upholding. Continuous thought after thought, without admixture or interruption, is true diligence. Ceaseless diligence will gradually enter single-mindedness and completely accomplish Pure Land karma.

※ Single-mindedness is the destination of Pure Land karma and the great door to the Pure Land. If one does not enter this door, one will never be secure. Practitioners should not fail to strive for it!

※ 1. Truly resolving birth and death and generating the Bodhi mind is the common path to learning the Path.
2. Upholding the Buddha's name with deep faith and vows is the proper essence of the Pure Land school.
3. Focusing the mind and concentrating on recitation is the convenient method to begin with.
4. Subduing current afflictions is the essential task of cultivating the mind.
5. Dedicatedly upholding the fourfold precepts is the fundamental basis for entering the Path.
6. Various ascetic practices are auxiliary conditions for cultivating the Path.
7. Single-mindedness is the destination of the Pure Land.
8. Various auspicious omens are the verification of rebirth.

The above eight matters should each be thoroughly explained. Those who cultivate Pure Land karma should not be ignorant of them.

※ In all Dharma-doors, clarifying the mind is essential. In all practice-doors, purifying the mind is essential. However, nothing clarifies the mind like Buddha recitation. Recalling the Buddha and reciting the Buddha's name, in the present and the future, one will definitely see the Buddha, and without relying on expedient means, one will naturally open one's mind. Is this not the key to clarifying the mind? Furthermore, nothing purifies the mind like Buddha recitation. One thought in accordance is one thought of Buddha; thought after thought in accordance is thought after thought of Buddha. A clear pearl dropped into muddy water will inevitably clear the water; the Buddha's name thrown into a chaotic mind will inevitably make the mind Buddha-like. Is this not the key to purifying the mind?

※ One phrase of the Buddha's name encompasses the essentials of both the awakening and practice doors. When awakening is raised, faith is included within it; when practice is raised, realization is included within it. Faith, understanding, practice, and realization all encompass the essentials of the Mahayana and Hinayana, and of all sutras, without exception. Therefore, is one phrase of Amitabha not the most essential path?

※ Our current thought-moment mind, completely true becoming false, completely false being true, unchanging all day long, conditioned all day long. If one does not follow the conditions of the Buddha realm to recite the Buddha's name, one will recite the nine realms. If one does not recite the three vehicles, one will recite the six realms of mortals. If one does not recite the realms of humans and devas, one will recite the three evil paths. If one does not recite the realms of ghosts and animals, one will recite the realm of hell. Because all that have a mind cannot be without thought. Because the mind-essence without thought is only realized by the Buddha. From equivalent enlightenment onwards, all have thoughts. Every thought that arises falls into the ten realms. There is no thought outside of the ten realms, because there is nothing outside of the ten dharma realms. Every thought that arises is the condition for receiving a birth. If one knows this principle and does not recite the Buddha's name, there has never been such a case.

※ All circumstances are only sensed because of karma and only manifested by the mind.

※ Compared to the Chan School's direct pointing to the human mind and seeing one's nature to become a Buddha, the two phrases "The mind makes the Buddha, the mind is the Buddha" in the *Contemplation Sutra* are even more direct and straightforward. Why? Because seeing one's nature is difficult, while making the Buddha is easy. What is seeing one's nature? Separating from mind, consciousness, intellect, and discrimination, the sudden bursting forth of spiritual light is seeing one's nature, therefore it is difficult. What is making the Buddha? Upholding the Buddha's name and contemplating the Buddha's adornments and rewards is making the Buddha, therefore it is easy.

※ The sutra says, "When you think of the Buddha, that mind is the thirty-two marks and eighty minor excellences." Is it not because thinking of the Buddha is making the Buddha? Achieving Buddhahood is Buddhahood. There is no difference in principle, but the difficulty between seeing one's nature and making the Buddha is so vast. Is not Buddha recitation more direct and straightforward than Chan meditation?

※ One is the words of the patriarch, and the other is the words of the Buddha. Which is heavier, which is lighter, what to take, what to discard? Practitioners should simply abandon their old habits, empty their minds, calm their energy, and try to contemplate and examine them. They will surely acknowledge that this saying is not mistaken.

※ When we are rightly reciting, the Western adornments and rewards are in my mind, and my mind is already within the Western adornments and rewards. It is like two mirrors reflecting each other, merging and illuminating each other. This is the aspect of pervading the ten directions horizontally. If we consider vertically through the three periods of time, then when we recite the Buddha's name, we see the Buddha, and we also become the Buddha. When we seek rebirth, we are reborn, and we are also liberating sentient beings. The three periods of time are simultaneous, without any before or after.

※ This principle is most difficult to understand, but most easy to believe. If one can simply accept it directly, one will definitely benefit fully.

※ Generate a vast mind, cultivate true practice, unite the mind with the Buddha, unite the mind with the Path, and then the mind can transform karma.

※ From here to the West, passing beyond a hundred thousand million Buddha lands, there is a world called Ultimate Bliss, where there is a Buddha named Amitabha, who is now speaking the Dharma. Simply make vows and uphold the name, and one will attain rebirth. This is the realm of the Buddha's mind and Buddha's eye, personally known and personally seen. It is not what the sages and virtuous ones of the three vehicles can know and see. Simply deeply believe in the Buddha's words, rely on them to make vows and uphold the name. To have the Buddha's knowledge and views is to have knowledge and views. There is no need to seek enlightenment separately.

※ In other practice doors, one must sever afflictions. If the afflictions of view and thought are not completely exhausted, then the segmented birth and death are not exhausted, and one cannot leave the Land of Co-dwelling.

※ Only cultivating Pure Land karma is a horizontal escape from the three realms. Without severing afflictions, one goes from this Land of Co-dwelling to that Land of Co-dwelling. Once born in that land, the roots of birth and death will be permanently severed.

※ If one cultivates Pure Land karma with a heavy heart, then Pure Land karma will be strong. The heart being heavy and karma being strong, heading towards the West, then when the report is over and life ends in the future, one will definitely go to the West and not be born elsewhere.

※ The ocean of the Buddhadharma, faith can enter. The Pure Land school, faith is even more essential.

※ Upholding the name and reciting the Buddha is where all Buddhas deeply practice. Only Bodhisattvas bound by only one more lifetime can know a small portion. All other sages and virtuous ones should simply follow and believe. It is not what their wisdom can know, let alone lowly ordinary people.

※ Great Master Zhiyi said: "The state of mind at the time of death is the state of mind that receives birth in the Pure Land."

※ The *Contemplation Sutra* says: "The mind makes the Buddha, the mind is the Buddha." Once these two phrases are raised, then the meaning that the mind outside of this does not make the Buddha and the mind is not the Buddha, the mind makes the nine realms, the mind is the nine realms, the mind does not make the nine realms, and the mind is not the nine realms, etc. are all clearly demonstrated. Alas! If one understands this principle and still does not recite the Buddha's name, then I can do nothing more.

※ The *Contemplation Sutra* says: "The mind makes the Buddha, the mind is the Buddha." These two phrases are not only the outline and essential dharma of the *Contemplation Sutra*. They are truly the great outline and essence of all the teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime. They are not only the outline and essence of the Dharma treasury of one Buddha Shakyamuni. They are truly the great outline and essence of the Dharma treasury of all Buddhas in the ten directions and three times.

※ Those who speak well of mind-nature will certainly not abandon cause and effect. And those who deeply believe in cause and effect will eventually greatly understand mind-nature.

※ Our current thought-moment mind, able to recite, completely true becoming false, completely false being true, conditioned all day long, unchanging all day long. The Buddha recited in one phrase, named by complete virtue, outside of virtue there is no name, and using the name to summon virtue, outside of the name there is no virtue. Outside of the reciting mind, there is no separate Buddha to recite. Outside of the recited Buddha, there is no separate reciting mind. The capable and the upheld are not two, sentient beings and Buddhas are clearly there. Fundamentally separate from four phrases, fundamentally devoid of hundreds of denials, fundamentally pervading everything, fundamentally containing everything, absolutely complete and harmonious, and inconceivable.

※ But the nature of our present thought-moment mind is our original true mind.


From the present moment of thought, complete truth becomes delusion, and complete delusion is precisely truth. All day long following conditions, all day long unchanging. Apart from this present moment of thought, where else would there be a true mind and self-nature?

※ Seeking the most direct, incisive, supremely sudden, and supremely complete path, nothing compares to the single practice of holding the name and reciting the Buddha's name.

※ The mind that is capable of reciting is fundamentally complete truth becoming delusion, complete delusion precisely being truth. The Buddha who is recited is fundamentally complete virtue establishing a name, complete name precisely being virtue. Outside the reciting mind, there is no separate Buddha to be recited. Outside the Buddha who is recited, there is no separate mind capable of reciting. When the reciter and the recited are both forgotten, the mind and Buddha are one. In each and every thought, one completely subdues and completely severs the five kinds of affliction, completely transforms and completely extinguishes the three obscurations of defilement, completely shatters the five aggregates, completely transcends the five turbidities, completely purifies the four lands, completely contemplates the three bodies, completely cultivates the myriad practices, completely realizes one's inherent nature, and completely accomplishes the unsurpassed, wonderful enlightenment.

※ Therefore, with the mind that is entirely Buddha, reciting the Buddha who is entirely mind, there truly is the fruit Buddha of one's own mind, completely sharing awesome virtue and spiritual power, secretly perfuming and blessing one.

※ A single phrase of the Buddha's name, without being mixed with other conditions, with the accomplishment of ten recitations, suddenly transcends countless eons. Not believing in this is truly like wood and stone. Abandoning this and cultivating something else is either madness or foolishness. What more is there to say? What more is there to say?

※ Simply cutting off the delusions of view is like cutting off a forty-mile flowing stream, let alone the delusions of thought. If the delusions of view and thought are not completely exhausted, one cannot escape from the cycle of birth and death. This is what is called vertically escaping the three realms; it is extremely difficult, extremely difficult.

※ If one truly and deeply, with a focused and diligent mind, believes, vows, and holds the name, then one is using the Buddha's knowledge and insight as one's own knowledge and insight. It is also in every thought using the Buddha's knowledge and insight to cure the knowledge and insight of sentient beings.

※ Intensely, constantly placing a mind of belief, vow, and name-holding within the heart, transforms the conditions for arising in the realm of birth and death into the conditions for arising in the realm of the Buddhas. This, within the gate of cultivation, is the most wonderful method of turning iron into gold.

※ When reciting the Buddha's name, one must not have separate thoughts. Having no separate thoughts is precisely cessation (止). When reciting the Buddha's name, one must be perfectly clear and distinct. Being able to be perfectly clear and distinct is precisely contemplation (观). In a single thought, cessation and contemplation are both complete; there is no separate cessation and contemplation.

Instructions by Great Master Yinguang (1)

※ The Bodhi enlightenment that Amitabha Buddha realized is completely encompassed by the ten-thousand-virtue, vast name of Amitabha Buddha.

※ The single phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha," as long as you recite it skillfully, becoming a Buddha will still have surplus! Without learning other methods, what regret is there?

※ You must know that Amitabha Buddha is the Dharma Realm's treasure body. This single name encompasses all Buddha names of the ten directions and three times.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation is the all-encompassing Dharma gate of Buddhism.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation takes faith, vow, and practice as its principle, takes Bodhicitta as its foundation, takes "It is this mind that makes a Buddha, it is this mind that is Buddha" as the true meaning of the cause encompassing the ocean of effects, and the effects permeating the source of causes. It takes gathering in the six senses and maintaining continuous mindfulness as the most essential effort for getting started.

※ Seeking rebirth in the West by reciting the Buddha's name is the most convenient and most reliable Dharma gate.

※ A single phrase of the Buddha's name includes the entire Great Treasury of teachings, leaving nothing unsaid.

※ Believing, vowing, and reciting the Buddha's name, seeking rebirth in the West, is the one and only decisive, excellent plan.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation completely encompasses all Dharma gates of a single era.

※ In the Dharma-ending Age, ordinary people who wish to attain the fruit of a sage, without relying on the Pure Land, are all mad and delusional.

※ Sentient beings of the Dharma-ending Age have shallow roots and little wisdom. To obtain true benefit from the doctrinal teachings or Chan Buddhism is extremely difficult! Extremely difficult! Only the Pure Land Dharma gate can be relied upon.

※ The Buddhadharma is vast and boundless. Ordinary people with extensive karma who wish to end birth, end death, and escape death in this lifetime have no option other than to believe, vow, recite the Buddha's name, and seek rebirth in the West, that will fulfill their wishes.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation relies on the Buddha's power to leave the three realms and be born in the Pure Land.

※ If there is no faith or vow, but only reciting the Buddha's name, this is still considered self-power. Without faith and vows, there can be no connection with Amitabha's great vows, and no mutual response and interaction.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation emphasizes faith and vows. With faith and vows, even without attaining single-mindedness, one can still be reborn. Having attained single-mindedness, if without faith and vows, one cannot be reborn. Worldly people mostly focus on single-mindedness, without emphasizing faith and vows, which is already missing the key point.

※ In the Dharma of Buddha Recitation, faith and vows are the vanguard. If there is no true faith or earnest vow, not only will one not be able to correspond and thus be unable to be reborn, but even if one does correspond, one will not be able to decisively be reborn.

※ If ordinary beings do not have faith and vows to connect with the Buddha, even if they cultivate all other superior practices, including the superior practice of holding the name, they will not be able to be reborn. Therefore, faith and vows are most important. Master Ouyi said: "Whether one is reborn or not depends entirely on the presence or absence of faith and vows. The level of one's rebirth depends entirely on the depth of one's name-holding." This is an ironclad case that a thousand Buddhas appearing in the world could not change.

※ The most important thing in the Dharma of Buddha Recitation is to end birth and death. Once you are intent on ending birth and death, then an aversion to the suffering of birth and death will naturally arise, and a joyful inclination towards the bliss of the West will naturally arise. When this happens, the two elements of faith and vow will be completely present in your thoughts.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation. The key is to have genuine faith and earnest vows. With genuine faith and earnest vows, even if one has not reached single-mindedness, one can still rely on the Buddha's compassionate power to be reborn with one's karma. If one has no faith and vows, even if one's mind is without wandering thoughts, it is only a reward for humans and gods, because it is not in accord with the Buddha. Therefore, one should emphasize faith and vows, seeking rebirth in the West.

※ The Dharma of Buddha Recitation emphasizes faith, vows, and practice. If one only knows how to recite without generating faith and vows, even if one attains single-mindedness, one may not be reborn. If one truly possesses genuine faith and earnest vows, even if one has not attained single-mindedness without confusion, one can still rely on the Buddha's compassionate power to be reborn.

※ Why are there so many people in the world who recite the Buddha's name, but so few who can truly end birth and death? It is only because those who recite the Buddha's name do not have deep faith and earnest vows, but only seek blessings, hoping for wealth and honor in the next life.

※ Those who now cultivate Pure Land practices mostly do not understand the principles, but only rely on appearances. But ordinary people's rebirth depends entirely on the sincerity of their faith and vows, and their mutual response and interaction with Amitabha's vast and great vows, thereby receiving his guidance and reception.

※ Among the Pure Land practitioners, in reality, ninety-nine out of a hundred are without Chan and without Pure Land.

※ All Dharma gates rely on self-power to end birth and death. The Dharma gate of Buddha Recitation also relies on the Buddha's power to end birth and death.

※ Sentient beings in the Dharma-ending Age have deep obstructions and shallow wisdom. Without relying on the Buddha's power, it is truly difficult to achieve liberation.

※ These various Dharma gates all rely on self-power, therefore they are difficult. The Pure Land Dharma gate entirely relies on the Buddha's power, therefore it is easy.

※ There are limitless Buddha-dharmas. If you want to rely on self-power to find your way in Chan, doctrine, discipline, or tantra, it is not easy. How much more difficult is it to realize no-birth and end birth and death through this?

※ All Dharma gates rely exclusively on self-power. The Pure Land Dharma gate relies exclusively on the Buddha's power. All Dharma gates require that delusions and karma be completely purified before one can end birth and death. The Pure Land Dharma gate allows one to be reborn with one's karma and immediately join the ranks of the sages.

※ Relying on self-power to end birth and death is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

※ Sentient beings in the Dharma-ending Age have thin blessings, shallow wisdom, deep obstructions, and heavy karma. If they do not cultivate the Pure Land Dharma and try to rely on their own power to cut off delusions and realize truth to end birth and death, then it is extremely difficult, extremely difficult.

※ Chan relies solely on self-power, while Pure Land combines the Buddha's power. Comparing the two Dharmas, Pure Land is most suited to the times.

※ What makes the Pure Land Dharma gate superior to all other Dharma gates is that it relies on the Buddha's power. All other Dharma gates rely on self-power. How can self-power be compared to the Buddha's power? This is the most important point in cultivating the Pure Land Dharma gate.

※ You must know that even Bodhisattvas who have attained the Dharma body must rely on the Buddha's awesome power before becoming Buddhas, how much more so ordinary beings with karmic power! Extravagantly talking about self-power, without relying on the Buddha's power, their words may be lofty, but their actions are actually base. The magnitude of the Buddha's power and self-power is more different than heaven and earth. May all practitioners understand this meaning.

※ Generally, do not study the rules and regulations of the Chan sect. Because the meaning of Chan lies beyond words, if you interpret the meaning according to the text, you will misunderstand the Buddhadharma and invite bad consequences due to good causes.

※ The method of Chan meditation is not suitable for people to learn now. Even if they learn, it will only become textual knowledge and views. They will definitely not be able to suddenly understand their own minds or personally see their own nature. Why? Firstly, there is no good teacher to support them and make correct judgments; secondly, students do not know what Chan is. It is called Chan meditation, but it is actually a misunderstanding.

※ Generally, do not pay attention to the sayings of the Zen School. Because the meaning lies beyond words, it is not something you can understand. Moreover, you must investigate yourself before you can understand. Don't say that you cannot understand this matter. Even if you can understand it, it is still difficult to end birth and death because you are relying on self-power. If you do not know and speak recklessly, then your crime will be extremely great, because you are talking nonsense about Prajna, which can ruin the Buddhadharma and mislead sentient beings. Be very careful! Be very careful!

※ The Zen School takes enlightenment as its main concern, while the Pure Land School takes rebirth as its main concern. Of those who become enlightened but are not reborn, ninety out of a hundred will not be reborn. Of those who are reborn without being enlightened, there is not even one in ten thousand.

※ Outsiders mostly seek enlightenment and seek various states, but they do not make decisive rebirth their top priority, which is called abandoning the root and pursuing the branch.

※ Those who recite the Buddha's name should not get involved in the path of Chan meditation, because those who meditate do not pay attention to believing, vowing, and seeking rebirth.

※ Chan meditation only investigates one's own mind, while Buddha Recitation also relies on the Buddha's power.

※ Seeing one's nature clearly is just enlightenment; it is not yet proof. In the end, one cannot end birth and death.

※ For the current situation, it is advisable to put aside Chan records and focus on Pure Land practices.

※ If you want to talk about self-power and other-power, and the difficulty and ease of Chan and Pure Land, nothing is clearer and more understandable than Master Yongming Yanshou's Four Alternatives.

※ When reciting the Buddha's name, every word and every phrase must come from the heart, come out of the mouth, and enter the ear. One phrase is like this, and hundreds of thousands of phrases are also like this. If you can do this, then wandering thoughts will have no way to arise, and the mind and the Buddha can naturally connect. Gathering in the six senses and maintaining continuous mindfulness, following this practice, there will be no deviation.

※ When you focus on listening attentively, whether you recite aloud or silently, you must recite from the heart, the voice must come from the mouth, and the sound must enter the ears. The mind and mouth must recite clearly and distinctly, and the ears must hear clearly and distinctly. If you concentrate your mind in this way, wandering thoughts will naturally cease.

※ The so-called Ten-Recitation Counting Method is that when you recite the Buddha's name, from one phrase to ten phrases, you must recite clearly and distinctly, and you must still remember clearly. After ten phrases, you must recite from one phrase to ten phrases again, not twenty or thirty. Recite and remember as you recite, without using beads, only relying on the mind to remember. If it is difficult to remember ten phrases directly, you can divide them into two breaths, then recite from one to five, and from six to ten. If this is still difficult, then recite from one to three, from four to six, and from seven to ten, making three breaths to recite, reciting clearly, remembering clearly, and hearing clearly. Wandering thoughts will have nowhere to take hold, and single-mindedness will naturally be attained over time.

※ The most wonderful method for exerting effort in reciting the Buddha's name is to gather in the six senses and maintain continuous mindfulness.

※ Recite the Buddha's name from morning till night without interruption. If your heart only contains the thought of wishing to be reborn, this is constant dedication.

※ Wish to quickly leave this world of suffering, wish to quickly be reborn in that world of bliss.

※ To make the mind, mouth, and ears all clear is the method of gathering in the six senses. (The mind is the sense of intellect, the mouth is the sense of tongue). When the mind and mouth recite and the ears listen, the eye sense will definitely not seek outward, and the body will also not be arrogant and presumptuous.

※ Listening is truly an essential method for reciting the Buddha's name. No matter who it is, it has benefits and no harm, and the merit is very deep.

※ Gathering in the six senses. Start with listening.

※ Holding the name and reciting the Buddha, adding attentive listening, is the most reliable. Regardless of whether one has superior, average, or inferior roots, one will benefit and have no drawbacks.

※ Being able to gather the ears to listen attentively when reciting the Buddha's name is the method of gathering in the six senses.

※ Using the effort of Guanyin's "returning the hearing to hear the self-nature," cultivate the Pure Land practice of "gathering in the six senses and maintaining continuous mindfulness" of Mahasthamaprapta.

※ "Truly for birth and death, generate Bodhicitta, with deep faith and vows, hold the Buddha's name." These sixteen characters are a major principle and foundation of the Buddha Recitation Dharma gate.

Instructions by Great Master Yinguang (2)

※ The calamities of the present world, and the various disasters we suffer, are all caused by bad karma in the past, which leads to experiencing the bitter fruits in the present.

※ Among all evil karmas, killing is the most serious.

※ Due to the firm formation of killing karma, human disasters such as war arise, along with natural disasters such as floods, fires, droughts, famines, epidemics, windstorms, earthquakes, and tsunamis. They come in succession.

※ Various disasters and illnesses are ultimately caused by deep-seated karma from the past and a lack of caution in present actions.

※ Among the knots of killing karma, eating meat is the most tragic and intense.

※ Looking at the past and present, times of peace are few and times of chaos are many. Even great peace lasts for only a few hundred years. Why is this so? It is because of the karma of killing and eating meat accumulated in past lives, and the selfish and self-interested mind in this life.

※ The terrible disasters of war, bandits, floods, droughts, and epidemics are mostly caused by killing and eating meat.

※ Because of killing, the harmony of nature is greatly disrupted, and the resulting violent energy causes natural disasters such as floods, droughts, plagues, and locusts. The karma of killing leads to man-made disasters of war and conflict. Ultimately, the root cause of these disasters is killing and eating meat in past and present lives.

※ The disaster of eating meat is extremely cruel and intense, not only harming this life but also affecting many future kalpas.

※ You must know that the great calamity of war is all caused by the killing karma of past lives.

※ Dangerous and serious illnesses are mostly caused by the killing karma of past and present lives.

※ People who eat meat, even if they do not kill themselves, cannot avoid killing karma, because there is no meat without killing, and because they hire people to kill on their behalf.

※ In one lifetime, people unknowingly eat countless living beings.

※ Killing all kinds of sentient beings to please the palate—are they wood and stone that do not know pain, that do not wish to live and wish to be killed and eaten? Since you kill and eat them, they will certainly kill and eat you in the future.

※ Why bother buying trouble with money (because eating meat incurs killing debts, hence the saying "buying trouble")?

※ Eating meat is detrimental to health, while a vegetarian diet is beneficial to health.

※ All sentient beings have Buddha-nature, all are past parents and future Buddhas. We should try our best to save and protect them, fearing that we are not doing enough. How can we kill their bodies to please our palate?

※ Eating meat every day is killing living beings every day, because there is definitely no meat without killing.

※ The issue of eating meat or being vegetarian is truly the root of our ascent and descent, and the peace and chaos of the world.

※ Those who wish for longevity, peace, and happiness, and to avoid unexpected disasters, should make abstaining from killing and eating vegetarian food the first and most wonderful method to reverse natural and man-made disasters.

※ Since you wish to cultivate Pure Land practices, you must cultivate the ethical relationships, fulfill your duties, guard against evil, maintain sincerity, avoid doing all evil, practice all good, abstain from killing, eat vegetarian food, protect living beings, believe, vow, and recite the Buddha's name, seeking rebirth in the West.

※ All great sages and virtuous people have used abstaining from killing and liberating lives as the foundation for averting killing calamities, cultivating blessed results, ending war, and enjoying a long life.

※ Those who abstain from killing and liberate lives rarely encounter plagues, fires, and other unexpected disasters. This shows that protecting life is essentially protecting oneself. Abstaining from killing can avoid being killed by heaven, ghosts, gods, and thieves, and avoid the mutual retribution of killing in the future.

※ If you want to eliminate the killing karma of the past and present, you must abstain from killing and eat vegetarian food, and sincerely recite the Buddha's name and recite the name of Avalokiteshvara. Then you will surely recover quickly, and you will be able to cultivate virtue and plant good roots.

※ For karmic-retribution illnesses that cannot be cured by doctors, sincerely reciting the Buddha's name and reciting the name of Avalokiteshvara will bring rapid recovery, because the vengeful spirits receive the grace of Buddha-recitation and depart for good realms.

※ When encountering extremely urgent disasters, simply reciting the holy name of Avalokiteshvara saves the most mental and physical effort and brings the most response.

※ Since you have taken refuge in the Three Jewels, you must abstain from killing, protect life, and eat pure vegetarian food. Even if you cannot eat pure vegetarian food right away, you must observe the Ten Vegetarian Days or the Six Vegetarian Days. You must deeply understand the faults of eating meat, and even on days when you do not eat vegetarian food, you must try your best to reduce eating meat and focus on reciting the Buddha's name with a whole heart.

※ The minds of people in the world today are extremely corrupt, and natural and man-made disasters are constantly occurring. The arrival of disasters cannot be predicted, and there is no way to avoid or prevent them. If you can follow what is said in the "Literary Record" and "Record of Auspicious Words" and sincerely recite the Buddha's name and Avalokiteshvara's name, you will surely receive blessings in the dark, and either turn existence into non-existence, or turn heavy consequences into light ones. You will definitely not suffer the same fate as those who do not recite the Buddha's name.

※ The merit of reciting the Buddha's name can not only lead to rebirth in the West, but can also eliminate unexpected disasters. Those suffering from karmic-retribution illnesses that cannot be cured by doctors will, after sincerely reciting the Buddha's name for a long time, all recover.

※ People in the world are accustomed to eating meat. You should know that all meat is poisonous, because it is caused by hatred and resentment when the animal is killed. Although it may not cause immediate death, it accumulates over time and will definitely cause sores and illnesses. Those who love themselves should permanently abstain.

※ Eating meat is a very strange thing, but because it has been practiced for so long, people do not know that it is wrong.

※ Killing living beings to sacrifice to heaven and earth is against heaven and earth's virtue of loving life.

※ Do not commit killing karma, because once you commit killing karma, you will receive the retribution of being killed.

※ If someone has a chronic illness that cannot be cured by Western or Chinese medicine, instruct them to abstain from killing, protect life, eat vegetarian food, recite the Buddha's name, and recite the name of Avalokiteshvara. If they are truly sincere, they can immediately change the situation and recover soon.

※ If you can exert the utmost sincerity and respect, generate the great Bodhicitta of benefiting yourself and benefiting others, recite Namo Amitabha Buddha, and recite the holy name of Namo Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva to deliver your karmic creditors from past lives, if they leave suffering and attain joy, the sick person's karma can be eliminated and the illness can be cured.

※ By cultivating ethical relationships, fulfilling your duties, guarding against evil, maintaining sincerity, avoiding doing all evil, practicing all good, abstaining from killing, protecting life, eating vegetarian food, reciting the Buddha's name, wishing to be reborn in the West, and permanently escaping the cycle of suffering, and by earnestly explaining these principles to others.

※ Constantly perform acts of liberating life and constantly commit acts of killing. Heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods are always witnessing, and they will surely bestow blessings and disasters accordingly. Do not neglect and bully the weak.

※ For those who wish for peace and prosperity in their family, health and tranquility in body and mind, peace in the world, and happiness for the people, please seek them all through abstaining from killing, liberating lives, eating vegetarian food, and reciting the Buddha's name. Then you will find everything you seek.

※ I have been advocating abstaining from killing, liberating lives, the principle of cause and effect, and other matters, in order to try to save us from natural and man-made disasters.

※ When treating illnesses, especially those caused by difficult-to-cure karmic retribution, instruct the patient to recite the holy name of Avalokiteshvara and advise them to abstain from killing, protect life, and cherish living beings.

※ Those who recite the Buddha's name should eat vegetarian food for life. If you cannot do that, you should observe the Six Vegetarian Days or the Ten Vegetarian Days, gradually reducing your meat consumption until you permanently abstain, which is the proper way.

※ Moreover, we are now in a time of great calamity, and there is no way to prevent disasters from happening. If you can constantly recite the Buddha's name and Avalokiteshvara's name, you will surely be protected by the Buddha's compassion and turn misfortune into good fortune. Even without disasters, you will still eliminate karma, increase wisdom, remove obstacles, and increase blessings.

※ Those who benefit others and benefit beings will prosper, while those who harm others and harm beings will perish.

※ You must know that benefiting others and benefiting beings is truly benefiting oneself. Harming others and harming beings is worse than harming oneself. Doing good will surely bring good rewards, and doing evil will surely bring evil retribution.

※ We should vigorously advocate abstaining from killing and eating vegetarian food as the fundamental solution.

※ Vegetable food is healthy, while meat food harms life. The hatred in killing is highly toxic. Do not be greedy for eating meat, because you must repay it when the time comes, and it will be truly pitiful.

※ All animals have consciousness, cherish life and fear death, and value their lives above all else. If you kill them for fun or eat them, you will definitely face retribution in this life and the next.

※ At the present time, the state of the world is like sleeping on a pile of firewood, with a raging fire burning underneath. Yet people still carelessly pass their days, not focusing on seeking salvation from a single phrase of the Buddha's name. Their understanding is extremely shallow!

※ If we investigate the cause of disasters, they mostly arise from killing. To stop the killing karma, we must abstain from killing, eat vegetarian food, protect living beings, and buy and release living beings.

※ Therefore, abstaining from killing and liberating lives is a fundamental and preventive solution for saving the world.

※ You must know that the act of liberating life is actually to awaken people to protect all life with supreme kindness.

※ The act of liberating life is originally to awaken the kindness in those who have not yet awakened, hoping to encourage them to abstain from killing and eat vegetarian food, and to allow all sentient beings to obtain what they need and live out their natural lifespan. In the short term, it stops the cause of killing; in the long term, it eliminates the effect of killing. In the small sense, it completes the purity of our minds; in the large sense, it eliminates the killing calamity in the world. Do not think that this is not an urgent matter and ignore it.

※ If they insist on waiting for absolute certainty before they are willing to liberate lives, then they will cause people to never engage in abstaining from killing and liberating lives in their entire lives. Such people will surely meet a time when no one can save them from death. Alas, how painful!

※ The matter of abstaining from killing and liberating lives is shallow and easy to see. The principle of abstaining from killing and liberating lives is deep and difficult to understand. If you do not understand the principle, even if you can do the act, your mind will definitely not be sincere and compassionate. The benefits of the field of merit will also be small and shallow depending on the capacity of your mind. If you encounter someone who does not know and slanders, you may be swayed by them, and your good intentions will disappear immediately.

※ When Buddhism came to the East, it explained the cause and effect, encouraging people to abstain from killing, liberate lives, and eat vegetarian food.

※ When people desire the reunion of their families, the extension of their lifespan, peace and happiness in body and mind, and wish that everything goes as they wish, they should generate great compassion and perform the act of liberating lives, so that heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods will all pity our sincerity in loving living beings, and then what we desire will be obtained.

※ People who care about the world and people's hearts today are all advocating abstaining from killing, liberating lives, eating vegetarian food, and reciting the Buddha's name, in order to explain the principles of reincarnation and cause and effect, and hoping that people all over the world can enjoy peace and happiness together, and obtain liberation together.

※ The act of liberating life is originally to inspire people to abstain from killing and protect life, and to put into practice one's own compassionate and unbearable thoughts. There are many people in the world, and their minds and actions are different. Even if you cannot move everyone, if you move just one person, then that one person will kill several fewer lives in their lifetime. How much more if it is more than just one person?

※ When you want to liberate animals, you should do it quickly in the summer. If you insist on waiting for everything to be equal and following the ritual, it may take a long time and harm life.

※ I am fortunate to have been born into the human realm because of good fortune from past lives. Therefore, I should resolve resentment and release bonds, abstain from killing and liberate lives, so that all living beings can obtain what they need. I should also recite the Buddha's name and dedicate it to the Pure Land, so that they can be liberated. Even if their karma is heavy and they cannot be reborn immediately, I should use the merit of this charitable act and pray for rebirth in the West at the end of my life.

※ The Buddha is greatly compassionate, allowing all beings to follow their own nature.

※ The small-minded do not know great principles, and wrongly use their own foolish views to prevent others from doing the good deeds of abstaining from killing and liberating lives. In the future, when they become animals, they will definitely not encounter people who liberate lives and save them. The suffering at that time is all caused by the wrong wisdom of today.

※ Eating vegetarian food is not difficult, but wanting to eat vegetarian food while being greedy is difficult! The Three Pure Meats and eating vegetables near meat are methods established for people with inferior roots.

※ The Buddha established the practice of eating vegetarian food during the vegetarian period in order to permanently end the karma of killing and as a convenient method for causing people to permanently end the consumption of meat.

※ Eggs should also not be eaten because they have life force. Also, they are poisonous.

※ Eggs should not be eaten. Those with wrong views say that eggs without a male can be eaten. Do not listen to this.

※ Buying creatures to liberate is the same as giving alms. You must use good methods, do not set a fixed time, do not set a fixed place, and do not set a fixed type of creature. Buy and liberate according to circumstances, so that the creatures can truly benefit. If you set a fixed time, fixed place, and fixed type of creature, you will be encouraging people to catch more.

Instructions by Great Master Yinguang (3)

※ Sincerity and reverence are truly the supreme secrets for transcending the mundane, entering the realm of the sages, and ending birth and death.

※ If you want to obtain the real benefits of the Buddhadharma, you must seek them in reverence. Having one part reverence eliminates one part karma and increases one part blessings and wisdom.

※ I will earnestly tell you a secret: utmost sincerity and reverence - wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!


※ To speak of sincerity and reverence – these words are known by everyone in the world, but this path is obscured to everyone in the world.

※ When writing scriptures, it should be done like a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) writing his policy essay. Not a single stroke should be careless, and the style must adhere to the formal style. Writing scriptures is intended to transform the mind and consciousness of ordinary people into the wisdom of the Tathagata. It is even more important to be strict, respectful, and filled with awe, without the slightest negligence, than a newly-appointed Jinshi entering the palace examination hall. One who can do this will surely be able to transform karmic consciousness into the Tathagata-garbha (womb of the Tathagata).

※ Making confessions and repenting is most easily resonant with the Pure Land Dharma. As the saying goes, "When the mind is pure, the Buddha-land is pure." However, having recognized one's errors and being willing to confess and repent, one must change one's ways and do good. If one does not change one's ways and do good, then so-called repentance is merely empty talk, without any real benefit.

※ Buddha images should be regarded as true Buddhas, not as just clay, wood, bronze, or iron.

※ The scriptures are the teachers of the Buddhas of the three times (past, present, and future), and the relics of the Dharma-body of the Tathagata should also be regarded as true Buddhas, not just paper and ink.

※ Whenever reciting scriptures, one must cease all worries and forget all worldly concerns, focusing the mind and reciting purely, as if facing the holy countenance and personally listening to the perfect sound. One must not allow even the slightest intention of laxity or negligence to arise. Over time, one can naturally subtly connect with the Buddha's wisdom and secretly align with the mysteries of the Way. When sincerity reaches its peak, one will suddenly achieve complete understanding. This is the most wonderful method for reading scriptures and reciting the Buddha's name.

※ Cause and effect are the methods for treating both the root and the symptoms. Whether an ordinary person first aspires or a Tathagata achieves perfect enlightenment, neither is outside the realm of cause and effect.

※ In this current time, if cause and effect and karmic retribution are not used as the specialized remedy for saving the nation and its people, then even with efforts made, they will not have great effectiveness.

※ The laws of three-lifetime causality and six-realm reincarnation taught by the Tathagata are profound to those who see them as profound and shallow to those who see them as shallow. Using them to cultivate the mind can sever delusions and realize truth, ending birth and escaping death. Using them to govern the world can overcome cruelty and eliminate killing, returning society to simplicity and purity.

※ In this current age, if cause and effect and karmic retribution and rebirth are not used as teachings, even if sages and worthies appear in the world together, there is ultimately nothing to be done.

※ The degeneration of morality and the entrapment of people's hearts today, leading to this extreme, are all caused by a lack of understanding of the principles of cause and effect and karmic retribution.

※ Cause and effect are truly the great defense that maintains people's hearts, sufficient to supplement the deficiencies of imperial rule. They are the great power by which sages, both in and out of the world, govern the world and liberate sentient beings, and they are also the key to the rise and fall of states throughout history.

※ Among books that explain cause and effect, none are better than the *Tàishàng Gǎnyìng Piān* (Tractate of Actions and Their Retributions) and the *Wénchāng Yīnzhì Wén* (Essay on Secret Blessings of the God of Culture). Regularly lecturing on these two books will bring immense benefits.

※ Cause and effect are the initial gate to entering the Way.

※ Those who cultivate Pure Land practice should advocate cause and effect.

※ Teaching children well, enabling them to understand the cause and effect of the three lifetimes, is truly the way to govern the world and rectify the source.

※ There are few good people in the world because families lack good teachings, and among family teachings, motherly instruction is essential.

※ A woman's heavenly duty is to assist her husband and educate her children. Without virtuous women, how can there be virtuous wives and mothers?

※ From the time a child has knowledge, they should be taught the Way of filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, as well as the matters of three-lifetime cause and effect and six-realm reincarnation.

※ As the ancient saying goes: "Teach the wife when she first arrives, teach the child when they are an infant." Because habits become nature, one should be cautious from the beginning. The order and disorder of the world are all based on this. Do not think that this is just the rambling talk of an old monk, irrelevant and unimportant.

※ To promote cause and effect and karmic retribution, nothing is better than teaching people to uphold and recite the *Tàishàng Gǎnyìng Piān* and the *Wénchāng Yīnzhì Wén*, which classify good and evil clearly, are easily understood, and are easy to benefit from.

※ The *Tàishàng Gǎnyìng Piān*, *Wénchāng Yīnzhì Wén*, and *Juéshì Jīng* (Awakening the World Scripture) are precious mirrors that show people how to restrain themselves and return to propriety.

※ The *Anshì Quánshū* (Anshì Complete Works) is the crown of good books, past and present.

※ Teaching children well is the foundation of good governance, and teaching daughters is especially important.

※ Women hold a large portion of the power to govern the country and pacify the world.

※ There are few virtuous people in the world because there are few virtuous women. If there are virtuous women, then there will be virtuous wives and mothers. If there are virtuous wives and mothers, then their husbands and children who are not virtuous will be rare indeed.

※ If a person has a virtuous mother in their youth and a virtuous wife in their adulthood, it will be impossible for them not to become a virtuous person. This is a good strategy for rectifying the source and achieving peace.

※ To reverse the morality of the world and people's hearts, one should solve the problem from the root, so that one uses little effort and achieves great effect.

※ What is meant by focusing efforts on the root is to promote family education and to promote cause and effect and karmic retribution.

※ Family education is the foundation for governing the country and pacifying the world, and cause and effect and karmic retribution are the essential means for assisting education.

※ Family and motherly education are the foundation for the flourishing of talented individuals and the peace of the world.

※ The ancient sages were all formed through the good education of virtuous parents.

※ Whenever teaching children, it must be done when they are infants. First, they must be made to know the theory of cause and effect and karmic retribution, so that all perverse and evil behaviors will naturally be feared and not committed.

※ The way to save the world is only to focus on family education, hoping that everyone will explain the principles of cause and effect to their children, in order to cultivate their foundation.

※ Having desired to cultivate Pure Land practice, one must uphold moral principles and fulfill one's duties, guard against evil and preserve sincerity, refrain from all evil, practice all good, abstain from killing and eat vegetarian food, cherish all life, have faith and make vows to recite the Buddha's name, and seek rebirth in the West.

※ People who recite the Buddha's name must be filial to their parents, serve their teachers, have a compassionate heart and not kill, cultivate the ten good deeds, and also be kind fathers, filial sons, friendly elder brothers, respectful younger brothers, harmonious husbands, obedient wives, benevolent masters, and loyal servants, each fulfilling their own duties. Do not consider whether others are fulfilling their duties towards me, I must always fulfill my duties.

※ Being filial to one's mother-in-law, respecting one's husband, educating one's children, showing kindness to servants, and teaching, nurturing, and cherishing the children of a previous marriage are truly the way of sages and worthies in the world, and also the method of the Buddha's teachings for strengthening the foundation.

※ Surely one should fulfill one's duties, hoping that the Buddhas and the heavens will bear witness.

※ Know that the Buddha's teaching to people is to exert effort in upholding moral principles, fulfilling one's duties, refraining from all evil, practicing all good, abstaining from killing and protecting life, eating vegetarian food, and reciting the Buddha's name.

※ You should emphasize upholding moral principles and fulfilling your duties, believing, vowing, and holding the name.

※ People who recite the Buddha's name must each fulfill their own duties and not violate worldly ethics, which is called upholding moral principles and fulfilling one's duties, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity, refraining from all evil, and practicing all good.

※ Those who study Buddhism must be kind fathers and filial sons, friendly elder brothers and respectful younger brothers, establish themselves and then establish others, benefit themselves and then benefit others, each fulfilling their own duties, leading by example, and broadly cultivating the six perfections and myriad practices, as a model for their fellow practitioners.

※ In this current age, even if an ancient Buddha who has already achieved perfect enlightenment were to appear, they would definitely not advocate anything other than upholding moral principles and fulfilling one's duties, and emphasizing the Pure Land Dharma. Even if Master Bodhidharma were to appear at this time, he would also use the Dharma door of relying on the Buddha's power to guide and instruct.

※ With upholding moral principles and fulfilling one's duties, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity, refraining from all evil, practicing all good, abstaining from killing and protecting life, eating vegetarian food, reciting the Buddha's name, vowing to be reborn in the West, eternally escaping the cycle of suffering, and universally explaining this earnestly to others.

※ Buddhism takes filial piety as its foundation. Therefore, the *Brahma Net Sutra* says: "Filial piety is called a precept, and it is also called restraint."

※ If one is not filial to one's parents and does not teach one's children, one is a sinner in the Buddha's Dharma. To seek the Buddha's response and blessing in this way is utterly impossible.

※ The *Contemplation Sutra* considers filial piety to parents, serving teachers, having a compassionate heart and not killing, cultivating the ten good deeds, as well as receiving the three refuges, fully observing the precepts, not violating the rules of conduct, and generating the Bodhi mind, deeply believing in cause and effect, reading and reciting the Mahayana, and encouraging others to progress, as the right causes for Pure Land practice. Having any one of these eleven things, with deep faith and vows, and dedicating merit to rebirth, one will obtain their wish.

※ When a woman is pregnant, she must not get angry, because great anger will cause a miscarriage.

※ When feeding a child, one must have a peaceful heart and spirit. If one gets very angry, the milk will become poisonous. In severe cases, the child will die immediately; in mild cases, the child will die in half a day or a day. There is definitely no case of not dying. If the anger is slight and the poison is small, the child may not die, but they will still get sick.

※ If one has become very angry, one must never feed the child. One must immediately let go of the anger and make one's heart peaceful and harmonious. Only after half a day can one feed the child again. When feeding, first squeeze out half a bowl of milk, throw it away, wipe the nipple, and then feed the child, and there will be no disaster.

※ If there is still anger in the heart, one cannot feed the child for even a day. If one feeds the child, even if they do not die, they will still get seriously ill.

※ Throughout history, how many children have been killed by poisonous milk? It is unknown how many Ganges sands. How sad!

Grand Master Yinguang's Teachings (4)

※ Death – if a student of the Way never forgets this word, their practice will naturally succeed.

※ Among the most tragic things in the world, nothing is worse than death, and yet no one in the world can escape it.

※ In reality, the word "death" is just a temporary name. It simply means that one's karmic retribution from past lives has reached its end, and one is abandoning this body to receive another body.

※ Know that one's own true nature of mind has no death. What is called death is merely abandoning this body and receiving another body.

※ If one does not recite the Buddha's name, one will be reborn in the good or bad realms according to one's good or bad karmic forces. If, at the moment of death, one single-mindedly recites *Namo Amitabha Buddha*, with this sincere recitation, one will surely cause the Buddha to emit great compassion and personally descend to welcome and guide one, enabling one to be reborn in the Pure Land.

※ One must never be afraid of death. Being afraid of death will not prevent one from dying, and will instead lead to not being reborn in the West. Because one's own mind is contrary to the Buddha, even though the Buddha has great compassion, they can do nothing about sentient beings who do not follow the Buddha's teachings.

※ Leaving this world of suffering and being born in that world of bliss is an extremely joyful thing. One should have a joyful heart.

※ Urge the sick person to let go of everything and single-mindedly recite the Buddha's name. If there are matters that need to be explained, have them explained quickly. After explaining them, put them aside. Think, "I am now going to follow the Buddha to be reborn in the Buddha-land. All the wealth, happiness, family, and various worldly situations are obstacles that will cause harm, and therefore I should not have even a single thought of attachment to them."

※ If one's parents, siblings, and other family members have a serious illness that is unlikely to be cured, one should generate a heart of filial piety and compassion, and urge them to recite the Buddha's name and seek rebirth in the West, and also help them recite. The benefit of enabling the sick person to die and be born in the Pure Land cannot be described.

※ Now I list three essentials as a basis for helping a dying person to be reborn. Although the words are rustic, the meaning comes from the Buddhist scriptures. When encountering this situation, follow them completely. The three essentials are:

First, skillfully enlighten, guide, and comfort them, enabling them to generate right faith.
Second, have everyone take turns reciting the Buddha's name to help them maintain pure mindfulness.
Third, strictly prohibit moving or crying, to prevent interfering with the process.

※ When a sick person is about to die, it is the moment of separation between the ordinary and the holy, humans and ghosts. It is an extremely crucial moment. One can only use the Buddha's name to enlighten their consciousness and must never bathe them, change their clothes, or move their sleeping place. Whatever their position, sitting or lying down, one can only follow their position and must not move them even slightly. One must also not show any sorrowful feelings or even cry.

※ If the sick person is about to stop breathing, one should recite together in three shifts, until after they have stopped breathing. Then, divide into shifts again and recite for three more hours (the *Guideline for Proper Dying Moments* states, "The longer the time, the better." Modern eminent monks generally advocate continuing to help recite for eight to twenty-four hours). Then rest, in order to arrange for the funeral.

※ Just put the word "death" on your forehead and hang it on your eyebrows.

※ The reason why the mind is not focused when reciting the Buddha's name is because the mind is not earnestly contemplating death. If one thinks that one is about to be washed away by water or burned by fire, and there is no way to be saved, or that one is about to die and fall into hell, then the mind will naturally become focused, without the need to seek another wonderful method.

※ Contemplate the suffering of hell and generate the Bodhi mind. This is the most essential teaching of the Great Awakened World Honored One.

※ When reciting the Buddha's name, one should always think that one is about to die and fall into hell. Then, even if one is not earnest, one will naturally become earnest; even if one is not in harmony, one will naturally become harmonious.

※ Reciting the Buddha's name with a fear of suffering is the first wonderful method for escaping suffering, and it is also the first wonderful method for resolving karma according to conditions.

※ One must hang the word "death" on one's forehead. (Original note: "This word is very good.")

※ When a person who recites the Buddha's name is sick, they should wholeheartedly wait for death. If their lifespan has not yet ended, they will be able to recover quickly, because putting everything down and reciting the Buddha's name is the best way to eliminate karma, and when karma is eliminated, the illness will be cured. If one does not let go and wants to get better, but cannot get better, then there is definitely no way to be reborn, because they do not wish to be reborn. If these principles are not understood, how can one obtain the Buddha's compassionate power?

※ The best method for recommending the deceased is reciting the Buddha's name. The food offerings in this world are all just for show.

※ Meat and wine are absolutely not allowed during a funeral.

※ After a person dies, one can only recite the Buddha's name. Do not perform water and land ceremonies, chant scriptures, or perform repentance ceremonies, because these things are all just for show, empty displays of power and influence, with little real benefit.

※ Hang the word "death" on your head.

※ Why be afraid of death? If one has a fear of death, one will forever suffer in the cycle of birth and death, with no time to escape from suffering.

※ Now, when reciting the Buddha's name, imagine that one has already died but has not yet been reborn. In every thought, all worldly feelings and thoughts should be put aside. Other than the Buddha's name, there should be no other thoughts.

※ Because I am already dead, all delusions are useless. Being able to recite in this way will surely bring great benefit.

※ Being reborn in the West is like leaving a cesspool and prison to arrive at a pure, blissful, free, and comfortable home.

※ One must never foolishly and falsely imagine being afraid of death. Having a fear of death will prevent one from being reborn.

※ Vainly spending seventy years, one's remaining days are few. Like a prisoner going to the marketplace, every step is closer to death. Reject everything and focus on cultivating the Pure Land. If you appreciate my foolish sincerity, you are a true lotus friend.

Grand Master Hongyi's Teachings

※ Reciting the Buddha's name is the most practical, simplest, and most vivid path in Buddhism, but because of its simplicity and practicality, without profound and mysterious principles, it makes intellectuals doubt it. For this path, intuition is more important than understanding. Don't ask "Where is the Land of Ultimate Bliss?" First, affirm whether you can humbly accept this Dharma door. When you enter this door, you will feel that this world is not simple, but profound and magnificent.

※ First, I ask you all: 1. Do you want to prolong your life? 2. Do you want to cure your illness? 3. Do you want to avoid disasters? 4. Do you want to have children? 5. Do you want to be reborn in the Pure Land? If you wish for these, I now offer you a very simple method, which is to release life.

※ I only wish that from now on, you will all vigorously practice the act of releasing life and painfully change the act of killing.

※ When one is seriously ill, one should put down all family matters and one's own body, and single-mindedly recite the Buddha's name, wholeheartedly hoping to be reborn in the West. One who can do this, if their lifespan has ended, will definitely be reborn. If their lifespan has not ended, even if they seek to be reborn, their illness can recover quickly, because their mind is focused and sincere, so they can eliminate karmic obstacles from past lives.

※ If one does not put down everything and single-mindedly recite the Buddha's name, if their lifespan has ended, they will definitely not be reborn, because they are only seeking to be cured and not seeking to be reborn, so there is no way to be reborn. If their lifespan has not ended, because they are wholeheartedly hoping to be cured, they will falsely generate worry and fear. Not only will they not recover quickly, but they will also increase their suffering.

※ Amitabha Buddha is the Supreme Physician King. To not seek refuge in him is called madness.

※ The phrase "Amitabha" is a panacea. To not take this medicine is called a great mistake.

※ If you are seriously ill and experiencing great pain, do not panic. This suffering is caused by karmic obstacles from past lives, or it may be a light reception in this life of suffering that would have occurred in the three evil realms in the future, in order to quickly repay it.

※ At the moment of death, do not ask about the will, and do not engage in idle talk or gossip, for fear of being moved by love and attachment to the world, which would hinder rebirth.

※ If you want to leave a will, you should write it when you are healthy and entrust it to someone for safekeeping.

※ Before ordinary people die, their bodies inevitably suffer. If they are forcibly moved, bathed, or changed clothes, the suffering will be greatly increased.

※ There are many cases where people who have vowed to be reborn have their right mindfulness disrupted by their family members, etc., at the moment of death, and consequently fail to be reborn.

※ There are cases where someone is about to be reborn in a good realm, but is touched by someone by mistake, causing them to become angry and be drawn into an evil realm.

※ When the masses are helping to recite the Buddha's name, a welcoming image of Amitabha Buddha should be placed in the patient's bedroom so that they can look at it.

※ The number of people helping to recite the Buddha's name is not fixed. If there are many people, they should take turns reciting continuously. Whether reciting the six-character or four-character Buddha name, whether fast or slow, one must first ask the patient and recite according to their usual habits and preferences, so that the patient can silently follow along.

※ Now I see that those who help to recite the Buddha's name all follow their own ideas without asking the patient. Since they have already violated their usual habits and preferences, how can they silently follow along? From now on, I hope that everyone who helps to recite the Buddha's name will pay attention to this matter.

※ After death, the most important thing is not to rush to move the body. Even if the body is soiled with excrement, do not rush to wash it. One must wait eight hours before bathing and changing clothes. Ordinary people do not pay attention to this matter, but it is the most important. I hope that you will widely advise others to act cautiously in accordance with this.

※ After death, family members must never cry, because what good does crying do? Being able to help recite the Buddha's name with all their might is the real benefit to the deceased. If one must cry, one must wait eight hours after death.

※ After death, after the recitation of the Buddha's name is finished, immediately lock the door to prevent others from entering and accidentally touching the deceased. One must wait eight hours before bathing and changing clothes. I have already said this earlier, and now I earnestly urge you again to remember, remember. Because if one moves the body within eight hours, the deceased will feel pain, even though they cannot speak.

※ After eight hours, when putting on clothes, if the joints of the hands and feet are stiff and cannot be moved, they should be washed with hot water. Wrap hot water with a cloth around the armpits and knee bends, and they will soon become active, like a living person.

※ We who cultivate the Pure Land school take rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss as our primary goal. Therefore, all our current activities, such as lecturing on the scriptures and writing treatises, are secondary. When the time comes, let go and leave, and never generate the slightest attachment or regret because our work of propagating the Dharma is not yet finished.

Venerable Daoyuan's Teachings

※ Let us study the value of the eight characters: "Abstain from killing, release life, eat vegetarian food, recite the Buddha's name." These eight characters are indeed the Buddha Dharma, and they are also the achievements, and the essence of Buddhism.

※ Buddha Dharma places the most importance on cultivation. What is called cultivation? It is correcting sinful behavior. Killing is the greatest sinful behavior!

※ All sentient beings have a desire to live. Being killed is so painful! Yet one is willing to kill them. This shows evil in body, mouth, and mind, and it is completely contrary to the Buddha's compassionate heart. Creating this evil karma will surely lead to falling into hell. How can one become a Buddha!

※ We advise Buddhist disciples to first take the passive step of "abstaining from killing." Next, take the active step of "releasing life." Since we ourselves can refrain from killing, then when we see sentient beings being killed, we should generate compassion and use various means to save them from being killed.

※ We ourselves do not create the karma of killing, but others create the karma of killing, and we ourselves eat meat. Is this reasonable? Therefore, not eating the flesh of sentient beings is the most thorough way to abstain from killing!

※ Abstaining from killing, releasing life, and eating vegetarian food are three good karmas that are preliminary practices. They cannot end birth and death. Severing karma is what ends birth and death. In the Dharma-Ending Age, sentient beings have heavy karma that is difficult to sever. Only the method of "reciting the Buddha's name" allows one to be reborn with karma, without waiting to sever it.

※ The first three good deeds are auxiliary practices, and reciting the Buddha's name is the main practice.

※ In the ten Dharma realms, reciting the Buddha's name is reciting the Buddha-realm. One thought of Buddha, one thought manifests the Buddha-realm; thought after thought of Buddha, thought after thought manifests the Buddha-realm. Over time, the mind and the Buddha become one. The other nine Dharma realms will not manifest. Is there any reason not to see the Buddha, not to be born in the West, and not to become a Buddha?

※ Reciting the Buddha's name requires reciting honestly, starting from the lowest and most superficial point, and obtaining the highest and most profound effect. One must never aim too high or be fickle.

※ It is difficult to sever afflictions with self-power, but relying on the Buddha's power allows one to be reborn with karma. Demons come to disturb with self-power, but the Buddha's power can ward off demons. The principles of the self-power Dharma doors are high and profound, and ordinary capacities are not easy to understand. The method of reciting the Buddha's name is simple and easy to understand, and it does not lead to mistakes. Relying on the Buddha's power is more stable and easier than self-power.

※ Reciting the Buddha's name is not reciting the nine Dharma realms, but reciting the Dharmakaya of the Buddha-realm. In this one thought of the Buddha's name, it is the time when the entire Dharmakaya manifests. There is absolutely no room for affliction to exist in it.

※ Reciting the Buddha's name is like being dyed with the Dharmakaya fragrance of the Buddha. Use the Dharmakaya fragrance to inspire the light of wisdom, and at the same time use the fragrance and light to perfume one's own inherent principle of enlightenment, which is called adorning with fragrance and light.

※ This land is turbid and evil and not easy to cultivate. The West is pure and good for effort.

※ Whether one is reborn in the West or not depends on whether one has faith and vows. In other words, as long as one has faith and vows, no matter how much one recites the Buddha's name, one will definitely be reborn in the West. This shows how important faith and vows are!

Venerable Yuanyin's Teachings

※ Amitabha Buddha is the teacher of all Buddhas, the king of all Buddhas. Reciting one phrase of "Amitabha Buddha" is equal to reciting all the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times.

※ What Amitabha Buddha has realized and accomplished is completely and completely condensed into this phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha," the myriad-virtue great name. In other words, this phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is everything that Amitabha Buddha has realized and accomplished.

※ One phrase of "Amitabha Buddha" contains all virtues, encompassing all six perfections and myriad practices; one phrase of "Amitabha Buddha" contains all meanings, encompassing the three collections of scriptures and twelve divisions of teachings; one phrase of "Amitabha Buddha" contains all Dharma doors, encompassing Chan, Teachings, Esoteric, and Vinaya.

※ The *Great Collection Sutra* says, "If a person only recites Amitabha, this is called unsurpassed profound Chan." One phrase of "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is Chan, and it is the most profound Chan.

※ One phrase of "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is Esoteric; the six-character great name is based on Sanskrit, and not a single character has been translated. It is the simplest and truest mantra.

※ All the three collections of scriptures and twelve divisions of teachings, condensed, are one phrase: "Namo Amitabha Buddha." Therefore, reciting one phrase of "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is equal to reciting all the three collections of scriptures and twelve divisions of teachings.

※ Reciting the Buddha's name is the most victorious, extraordinary, inconceivable, and unsurpassed great Dharma. Only Buddhas and Buddhas can fully understand this Dharma door; those below the Equal Enlightenment stage can only know a small part of it, let alone we ordinary beings with karmic obstacles.

※ One phrase of "Namo Amitabha Buddha" fully possesses all perfect blessings, completely encompassing all profound wisdom. Just upholding and holding onto this one phrase of "Namo Amitabha Buddha" encompasses the entire ocean of Buddha Dharma, without any shortcomings.


※ The entire essence of Buddhism is contained in the phrase 'Namo Amitabha Buddha.' In other words, this phrase 'Namo Amitabha Buddha' is sufficient to represent the entirety of the Dharma.

※ The phrase 'Namo Amitabha Buddha' is the primary purpose of the World-Honored One's appearance in this defiled and evil world, the ultimate and uninhibited expression of the Buddha's original vow, and the supreme essence of all the Three Baskets and Twelve Divisions of the scriptures.

※ The phrase 'Namo Amitabha Buddha' transcends all Chan, Teachings, Vinaya, and Tantra, encompassing all Chan, Teachings, Vinaya, and Tantra. Therefore, Master Yin Guang said: "Sentient beings of the Nine Realms, apart from this door, cannot perfectly accomplish Buddhahood; Buddhas of the Ten Directions, abandoning this Dharma, cannot universally benefit all beings."

※ To speak all the good words in the world is not as good as saying nothing and reciting 'Namo Amitabha Buddha'; to learn all the knowledge in the world is not as good as being illiterate and reciting 'Namo Amitabha Buddha.'

※ If we are truly learning Buddhism, the more we learn, the simpler we should become; the more we learn, the more humble we should become; the more we learn, the more ashamed we should become. Simplicity reaches the point where only the sacred name 'Amitabha Buddha' fills our lives; humility reaches the point where we see everyone as a Bodhisattva, and only we are truly ordinary beings; shame reaches the point where all good deeds are directed towards others, and all mistakes are always directed towards ourselves.

※ Those who truly recite the Buddha's name must bow to the Buddha every day. Consider the Flower Garland Sutra, revered as the King of Sutras. The focus of this great sutra lies in the Ten Great Vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. The first of these Ten Great Vows is 'Reverencing All Buddhas.' One can imagine the importance of bowing to the Buddha for cultivation.

※ One bow to the Buddha eradicates sins like the sands of the Ganges. The evil karma we have created over countless lifetimes is as vast as empty space. If we do not bow to the Buddha and repent, how can we eliminate evil karma that is like mountains and seas?

※ To lavishly claim that reciting the Buddha's name eliminates the need to bow to the Buddha is the deceptive and self-deceiving rhetoric of lazy and indolent people. Everyone must never follow this.

※ Among all sins, killing is the heaviest, because what sentient beings value most is their own life. To kill it is what it hates most, creating the deepest enmity. Blood debts must be repaid with blood, and the future karmic retribution will be the most tragic and intense!

※ The root of all diseases comes from killing. All natural and man-made disasters, cancers, epidemics, and all kinds of misfortunes are due to the karmic retribution of the killing we have committed in the past.

※ The Lankavatara Sutra says: "Eating meat is the same as killing." Because meat all comes from the slaughter of living beings, eating meat is equivalent to killing. If we eat meat every day, it is equivalent to creating killing karma every day. Eating meat for three meals is equivalent to owing killing debts for three meals.

※ The Nirvana Sutra says: "Those who eat meat cut off the seeds of great compassion." The Buddha's mind is the mind of compassion. How can those who eat meat cultivate and nurture compassion when they have already cut off the seeds of great compassion, deviating from the Buddha's mind? All cultivation is in vain!

※ The Surangama Sutra says: "Those who eat meat will not accomplish any merit they seek." Eating meat creates killing karma and invites killing sins, which is the biggest reason why most Buddhists are hindered from being reborn in the Pure Land. Eating vegetarian food is the crucial key to our rising or falling. Everyone must not neglect this!

※ The greatly compassionate World-Honored One instructed us in the Bodhisattva Precepts of the Brahma Net Sutra: "Out of compassion, practice the activity of releasing life." Releasing life is generating a compassionate heart, contributing money and effort to rescue living beings who are trapped, suffering, and about to be slaughtered. Because what all sentient beings value most is their own lives, the merit of releasing life is the greatest, and the good karmic connections formed are the deepest. It is, besides the main practice of reciting the Buddha's name, the supreme auxiliary practice for being reborn in the Pure Land.

※ The Bodhisattva Precepts of the Brahma Net Sutra say: "The Dharma of permanence is to teach people to release life." Because the compassion of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors; because the longing for freedom and the desire for life and survival of all beings in heaven and earth will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors. Therefore, releasing life is a permanent method, unchanging and always feasible, that will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors.

※ Master Lianchi, a great virtuous one of his generation who vigorously promoted releasing life throughout his life, exhorted us: "The Brahma Net Sutra regards releasing life as the Dharma of permanence. Permanence is the vajra body, immeasurable life."

※ Releasing life is an act of rescuing lives in times of emergency, so the merit is great and cannot be compared to other small good deeds.

※ Releasing life is the best way to nurture compassion.

※ Eating vegetarian food is merely stopping evil, passively no longer creating new killing karma and no longer accumulating new killing debts; while releasing life is promoting good, actively redeeming lives and repaying killing debts owed in the past. Eating vegetarian food and releasing life are two sides of the same coin and need to complement each other, proceeding side by side, so that the effect will be significant.

※ Depending on the size of each person's mind and the level of wisdom, there will be completely different reactions and views on releasing life. The greater the mind and the higher the wisdom of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the purer and simpler they are in generating a compassionate thought to redeem lives, without consideration, without purpose, without discrimination. Ordinary people are filled with deluded thoughts, discrimination, attachment, hesitation, and even ridicule and criticism. The smaller the mind and the lower the wisdom, the more opinions there are, the deeper the slander, and the more intense the obstruction!

※ Even in the most恶劣, the most dangerous, and the most polluted environments, regardless of the time or place, as long as there is an opportunity, and we see living beings in urgent distress and suffering, those with a compassionate heart will definitely not sit idly by and watch them die, but will definitely do their best to help them. But those without compassion will only make excuses, hesitate, and never reach out a helping hand, watching helplessly as living beings are tragically slaughtered!

※ The issue of releasing life is actually just a matter of having or not having compassion.

※ Even if everyone in the world opposes releasing life and criticizes releasing life, I will still insist on releasing life for the rest of my life, and I will promote releasing life for the rest of my life, because all sentient beings are our past parents and future Buddhas. To watch them die and allow them to be slaughtered is to be unworthy of being human!

※ Reciting the six-character mantra 'Namo Amitabha Buddha' is the greatest release of life among all releases of life, and it is the most important and ultimate meaning of releasing life!

※ The four key points of learning Buddhism are: 'Honestly reciting the Buddha's name, bowing to the Buddha and repenting, abstaining from killing and eating vegetarian food, and rescuing lives through releasing life.'
