**A Compilation of Exhortations on Practice**

Collected by the Kaohsiung Pure Land Society

**Foreword**

The Buddha Dharma is the most magnificent treasure in the human world. The Buddha, through the ultimate, perfect, unsurpassed, and equitably enlightened realization of an awakened being, revealed the truths of the universe and human life, the principles of karmic cause and effect, and the methods for pursuing a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. These methods lead to liberation from the six realms of transmigration and the cycle of birth and death. He fully laid out this teaching for all future generations to find peace in the present and liberation at the end of life.

However, from the Dharma's golden age in India two or three thousand years ago to its introduction to China during the Eastern Han Dynasty, which marked the beginning of the Semblance Dharma Age, and then to the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, when it entered the Degenerate Dharma Age, the Buddha had long foreseen that the Dharma's fortune would gradually decline. This was because, in the Degenerate Dharma Age, people’s hearts would become increasingly corrupt, ethics more shallow, the world's chaos would intensify, and the maladies within Buddhist communities would continually worsen. Nonetheless, the Buddha's teachings are flawless. The spirit and essence of the Dharma have not changed. It is simply that beings in the Degenerate Dharma Age have deep karmic hindrances, meager blessings, shallow wisdom, and inferior faculties. Those who propagate the Dharma fail to understand the needs of beings, teachings are flawed, practitioners blindly practice, and learning is deficient. Even demonic and heretical paths infiltrate Buddhist communities, using distorted Dharma to seek fame, gain, and amass wealth. In the Degenerate Dharma Age, heretical teachers appear like the sands of the Ganges. If practitioners are not careful, they can easily stray from the spirit and essence of Buddhism, fall into evil traps, and become unwitting servants of demons.

In the Degenerate Dharma Age, it is difficult to encounter good and wise teachers and even harder to meet enlightened masters. Everywhere there are outwardly radiant but inconsistent heretical teachers, and everywhere there are the blind leading the blind, gathering disciples like demons. If practitioners cannot distinguish right from wrong and lack steadfast views, they easily follow the crowd, absorb demonic views, go astray, and plunge themselves into eternal suffering. This is a matter that should never be taken lightly.

In fact, the safest and most reliable method for practicing Buddhism in the Degenerate Dharma Age is to ‘take the ancients as our teachers.’ We should take the great masters of past generations, with their lofty aspirations and renowned achievements, as our guides and their precious teachings as the mottos for our own practice. Among those closest to our time and most revered by the masses, Master Yin Guang stands out. Therefore, the ‘Complete Works of Master Yin Guang,’ the ‘Selected Excerpts from Master Yin Guang's Essays,’ and the ‘Selected Q&A from the Complete Works of Master Yin Guang’ are the canon that those aspiring to learn Buddhism should respect and review daily. By constantly reading Master Yin Guang's writings and striving to put them into practice, we are constantly drawing near to him and becoming his direct disciples. Through this kind of practice, we can be certain to achieve daily progress and success!

This book, “Exhortations on Practice,” aims to extract the most essential insights from the Buddha’s sutras, combined with the most important instructions from the teachings of great masters, so that we ordinary beings of the Degenerate Dharma Age can quickly grasp the key points of Buddhist practice. By putting them into practice, we can successfully follow in the footsteps of the Buddha and past masters and embark on the broad path to peace and liberation!

**Ten Essential Points for Practice**

**1. Filial Piety Towards Parents**

Buddhism regards filial piety as the foundation. Filial piety toward parents is the greatest root of the Buddhist path and the most basic element of being human. Even crows know how to repay their parents’ kindness. If we cannot be filial to our parents, are we not worse than beasts?

Our parents are the greatest fields of merit in our lives. The merit of being filial to parents is no different from that of being filial to the Buddha. The inability to be filial to parents is the greatest mistake in life. Those who are unfilial do not even have the basic qualifications to practice Buddhism.

Furthermore, persuading our parents to have faith, vow to be reborn in the West, and be forever liberated from the suffering of transmigration is the most ultimate and complete form of filial piety.

**2. Fulfilling One's Duties**

In this world, each person has their own duties and responsibilities. Practitioners of Buddhism should be diligent in their work, setting an example for their families, society, and nation. Being filial to parents, educating children, caring for the family, benefiting society, and serving the country – these are the marks of a true practitioner. To avoid one's responsibilities and fail to fulfill one's duties while claiming to be a practitioner is self-deception. One will not achieve anything in this way.

**3. Deep Faith in Karma**

The heart of all Buddhist teachings is the principle of cause and effect. Planting good causes will surely lead to good results, and planting evil causes will surely lead to evil results. The law of karma is infallible. If retribution is not seen, it's merely because the time is not yet ripe. Practitioners of Buddhism should deeply believe in karma, take the precepts as their teacher, reflect daily, and constantly correct their faults.

Furthermore, those who practice mindfulness of the Buddha deeply believe that planting the good seed of Buddha recitation will surely lead to the good result of Buddhahood. This is the most profound of karmic principles.

**4. Abstaining from Killing and Eating Meat**

Practitioners of Buddhism should avoid all evil deeds, making every effort to cut off all sinful behavior. Among all sins, the sin of killing and eating meat is the gravest. This is because what beings value most is their own lives. To kill them and eat them is the source of their deepest resentment, creating the deepest karmic debts. In the future, these debts will surely be repaid with blood and suffering. Therefore, among all evils, abstaining from killing and eating meat is the most urgent!

**5. Releasing Lives and Saving Beings**

Practitioners of Buddhism should practice all good deeds, making every effort to act whenever opportunities arise. Among all good acts, releasing lives is paramount. This is because it is an act of emergency rescue, with the greatest merit, far surpassing other minor acts of good. What beings value most is their own lives. To release and save them elicits their deepest gratitude, establishing the deepest good karmic connections. Future blessings will be incredible. Therefore, among all good deeds, releasing lives and saving beings should be prioritized!

**6. Utmost Sincerity and Reverence**

Sincerity and respect are the foundations for accomplishing any endeavor in the world. Master Yin Guang further teaches that we should exert ourselves to the utmost, putting sincerity and respect into practice in the most extreme way. With a bit of sincerity and respect, we gain a bit of merit. With full sincerity and respect, we gain full merit. This is the miraculous secret to success in Buddhist practice that everyone must remember!

**7. Awakening the Bodhi Mind**

The merit of Buddhist practice is directly proportional to the breadth of one's heart. The greater the heart, the greater the merit. Therefore, practitioners of Buddhism must have a vast heart. They should never do anything for selfish gain! They must truly awaken within their hearts a sincere desire to benefit all sentient beings. We aspire to achieve Buddhahood and, upon doing so, will have the ability to liberate all beings. We guide beings, aspiring to share the essence of the Dharma with the masses whenever the opportunity arises.

Furthermore, the sincere desire to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is the true awakening of the Bodhi Mind.

**8. Bowing to the Buddha and Repenting**

The sins we have committed throughout countless lifetimes, if they had a physical form, would be more vast than empty space itself. We are, in reality, but ordinary beings burdened with deep karmic hindrances. Therefore, practitioners of Buddhism must cultivate a sense of shame and repentance and diligently perform prostrations. One prostration can eliminate countless sins. Prostrating and repenting is the best way to express our sincerity, respect, and self-reflection.

**9. Faith, Vow, and Mindfulness of the Buddha**

The Pure Land path relies on the Buddha’s power for salvation. Faith means believing that there is an Amitabha Buddha in the Western Pure Land. Vow means sincerely wanting to be reborn in that land and to leave this suffering world. Practice means to wholeheartedly recite the holy name “Namo Amitabha Buddha.” As long as one possesses the three provisions of faith, vow, and practice, one can, in this very lifetime, rely on Amitabha Buddha's great vows for salvation, escape the cycle of birth and death, and end transmigration forever. This is the deepest, most wondrous, most special, and most convenient of all Buddhist paths!

Logically speaking, a single recitation of ‘Amitabha Buddha’ relies on the Buddha's power for salvation and is a completely, absolutely guaranteed way to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. However, why are there so many people reciting the Buddha’s name now, yet so few actually reborn in the Pure Land?

This is a very serious and critical issue. The reason why people reciting the Buddha's name today fail to be reborn is that they ‘lack faith and vow, fear death, and do not genuinely desire rebirth.’ Most people recite the Buddha’s name simply to seek longevity, health, peace, wealth, and worldly success. They absolutely do not seek rebirth in the Western Pure Land!

The single word ‘death’ can be used to test whether a practitioner of mindfulness of the Buddha possesses genuine faith and vow. Ask yourself, are you afraid of death? If you had to die now, and Amitabha Buddha was ready to receive you into the Western Pure Land, would you be willing? A true practitioner who detests this Saha world and rejoices in the Pure Land would surely view death as going home and be willing to go with Amitabha Buddha to the Western Pure Land as soon as possible. They would absolutely not be afraid of death. They would welcome death and be ready to be reborn at any time. However, the hypocritical and falsely devoted practitioners are attached to life and afraid of death. They do not want to die or be reborn. They make excuses and cling to life. They want to live a few more years. Know this: this single fear of death, this unwillingness to die, this unwillingness to be reborn is contrary to Amitabha Buddha's heart. If one lacks the three provisions of faith, vow, and practice, how can one successfully be reborn in the Western Pure Land?

Most people reciting the Buddha's name today are, in fact, false practitioners. The word 'death' must be constantly kept in mind so we can test ourselves. As long as a practitioner is not afraid of death, welcomes death, and is ready to be reborn in the Pure Land as soon as possible, they are truly a person who "detests the Saha world and rejoices in the Pure Land." Such a person, whether they recite the Buddha's name one thousand times or ten thousand times, will surely be reborn in the Pure Land!

**10. Practice and Implementation**

The most important thing in Buddhism is practice. An old woman who is illiterate, who doesn't understand the scriptures, who only knows to eat vegetarian food, prostrate before the Buddha, and sincerely recite 'Amitabha Buddha' often achieves more than a renowned scholar who is eloquent and has mastered the three canons. The key is whether one is able to practice and implement. Knowledge without action is like fighting battles on paper or counting treasures in a dream. It is ultimately futile!

In conclusion, in the study of Buddhism, one should strive for focus and avoid distractions. As long as one grasps the key points and strives to implement them, one will truly realize the practical benefits of the Dharma.

**II. Essence of the Five Pure Land Sutras**

**The Amitabha Sutra (Buddha Speaks of Amitabha)**

*   “From here, passing over hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha lands to the West, there is a world called ‘Ultimate Bliss’. In that land, there is a Buddha named Amitabha, now teaching the Dharma.”
*   “The sentient beings of that country experience no suffering, but only various joys. Hence, it is called ‘Ultimate Bliss’.”
*   “In that Buddha land, there are no three evil paths. Shariputra, in that Buddha land, even the names of evil paths do not exist, let alone the reality.”
*   “The Buddha's light is immeasurable, illuminating all the lands of the ten directions without obstruction. Therefore, He is called Amitabha.”
*   “The Buddha's lifespan and that of His people is immeasurable and without limit of Asankheya Kalpas. Therefore, He is called Amitabha.”
*   “Since Amitabha Buddha attained Buddhahood, ten kalpas have passed until now.”
*   “In the land of Ultimate Bliss, all those born are non-retrogression (Avivartika).”
*   “Sentient beings, upon hearing this, should make a vow to be born in that land. Why is that? Because they will be able to meet and be together with all the supreme sages.”
*   “One cannot be born in that land with a small amount of roots of goodness, merits, and causes.”
*   “If a good man or good woman, hearing of Amitabha Buddha, hold onto His name, if for one day, two days, three days, four days, five days, six days, or seven days, with focused concentration, at the time of their death, Amitabha Buddha and His assembly of sages will appear before them. At the time of death, their minds will not be confused, and they will be born in the land of Ultimate Bliss of Amitabha Buddha.”
*   “If there are sentient beings who hear these words, they should make the vow to be born in that land.”
*   “You sentient beings, should believe in the praise of the inconceivable merit of this sutra that is protected by all Buddhas.”
*   “If a good man or good woman, upon hearing this sutra, accepts it, upholds it, and hears the names of the Buddhas, all these good men and women will be protected by all the Buddhas, and they shall all attain non-retrogression from Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.”
*   “You all should believe and accept my words and the words of all the Buddhas.”
*   “If there is anyone who has already made a vow, is making a vow, or will make a vow to be born in Amitabha Buddha’s land, all of these people will attain non-retrogression from Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi. In that land, whether they have already been born, are being born now, or will be born, all will attain enlightenment.”
*   “All good men and good women, if they have faith, should make the vow to be born in that land.”
*   “Know that I, in this world of five turbidities, have accomplished this difficult thing and attained Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi and have taught this difficult-to-believe Dharma to all sentient beings. This is truly difficult.”

The exception is for those who commit the five heinous crimes or slander the true Dharma.”
*   “Constantly use compassion to liberate sentient beings, completely liberating all suffering beings.”
*   “Carefully guard your speech, not criticizing others’ faults.
Carefully guard your body, not straying from the precepts.
Carefully guard your mind, with purity and no defilements.”
*   “To the West, past billions of Buddha lands, there is a world called Ultimate Bliss. The Dharma Treasury has become a Buddha named Amitabha. Since achieving Buddhahood, ten kalpas have passed until now. He is now teaching the Dharma.”
*   “The majesty and light of Amitabha Buddha is the most honored and supreme, beyond the reach of all Buddhas in the ten directions.”
*   “Only Amitabha Buddha's light illuminates limitless, boundless, and countless Buddha lands.”
*  “The light of Amitabha Buddha is good and magnificent, surpassing the light of the sun and moon by ten billion times. His light is the most revered, and He is the King among Buddhas.”
*   “All those who are reborn in the ten directions are born naturally in the seven-jeweled lotus ponds. They receive bodies of pure emptiness and infinite forms. They do not hear the names of the three evil paths. Even the concept of suffering is non-existent, let alone the actual suffering. There is only the sound of natural joy. Therefore, that country is called Ultimate Bliss.”
*   “If one awakens the Bodhi mind, single-mindedly recites Amitabha Buddha, cultivates various merits, and vows to be born in that land, at the end of their life, Amitabha Buddha and His assembly of sages will appear before them. In an instant, they will follow that Buddha and be reborn in his country.”
*   “If there are sentient beings who wish to see Amitabha Buddha in this lifetime, they should awaken the unsurpassed Bodhi mind. They should also single-mindedly recite the name of the land of Ultimate Bliss, accumulate good roots, and dedicate them. By doing so, they will see the Buddha, be born in that land, attain non-retrogression, and achieve unsurpassed enlightenment.”
*   “You must awaken the unsurpassed Bodhi mind and single-mindedly recite Amitabha Buddha.”
*   “You must be filial and sincerely faithful. Believe in the profound words of the Buddha’s sutras and believe that good deeds bring good fortune.”
*   “All who are reborn attain non-retrogression, possess the thirty-two marks of a Buddha, and will all become Buddhas.”
*   “There are limitless, countless, inconceivable, incomparable, and boundless worlds where all the Buddhas and Tathagatas praise the merits of Amitabha Buddha.”
*   “The Buddha's original vows have the power that upon hearing his name, those who wish to be reborn in that land will naturally attain non-retrogression.”
*   “Worldly men and women, if they are in sudden distress, should take refuge in Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. There is no one who will not be liberated.”
*   “In the eight directions and above and below, there are countless Buddha lands. Amitabha’s land is vast, long-lasting, bright, and happy. It is supremely unique.”
*   “The secret treasures of all Buddhas are completely understood.”
*   “People in the world contend for unimportant things. In this extremely evil and suffering world, they diligently work to sustain themselves. The high and low, rich and poor, young and old, men and women, are constantly thinking and worrying, driven by their minds. Without fields, they worry about fields. Without homes, they worry about homes. They worry about whether they have or do not have families and possessions.”
*  “People, amidst their cravings and desires, are born alone, die alone, leave alone, and return alone. They experience suffering and joy alone. No one can replace them.”
*  “Why not strive to practice good when you are strong and healthy? What are you waiting for?”
*   “There are many who are deluded, and few who are enlightened. Each harbors malicious intentions. Evil permeates the world. They recklessly act against the way of heaven and earth.”
*   “Love, desire, and glory are not permanent. All will be separated. There is nothing to rejoice in. You should strive diligently to be born in the land of peace and bliss.”
*   “Between heaven and earth, things happen naturally. Even if retribution is not immediate, good and evil will always return in due time.”
*   “Between heaven and earth, the five paths of rebirth are clear. Good and evil deeds have their corresponding retributions. Misfortunes and blessings follow one another. Everyone must bear their own consequences. No one can take their place.”
*   “What is paramount? One should correct one’s own mind. One should correct one’s own body. The ears, eyes, mouth, and nose should all be corrected. Keep one’s mind and body pure, aligning with goodness.”
*   “Know that doubt is a great harm to all Bodhisattvas. It leads to the loss of great benefits. Therefore, one should clearly believe in the unsurpassed wisdom of all Buddhas.”
*   “If you use formless wisdom to cultivate roots of merit, purify the body and mind, separate from discrimination, seek rebirth in the Pure Land, aspire to Buddhahood, you will be born in a Buddha land and attain eternal liberation.”
*  “If good men and women hear the name of Amitabha Buddha and can generate a single thought of joyful fondness, take refuge in Him, respectfully worship Him, and practice as taught, know that these people have gained great benefit and have acquired the merits spoken of above. Their minds will not be inferior or arrogant. All of their good roots will increase. Know that such people are not of the Small Vehicle. In my Dharma, they are called the foremost disciples.”

**The Contemplation Sutra (Buddha Speaks of Contemplation of Immeasurable Life)**

*   "Those who wish to be born in that land should cultivate three types of good conduct."
    *  "First: Filial piety towards parents, serving teachers and elders, compassionately refraining from killing, and cultivating the ten good deeds."
    *  "Second: Accepting and upholding the three refuges, fulfilling all precepts, and not violating decorum."
    *  "Third: Awakening the Bodhi mind, deeply believing in karma, reciting the Mahayana sutras, and encouraging others to practice."

These three actions are called the pure karma. These three types of actions are the pure causes and conditions for the three Buddhas of the past, present, and future.

*   “All Buddhas and Tathagatas are the Dharmakaya body, pervading the minds and thoughts of all sentient beings. Therefore, when you think of the Buddha, that thought is the thirty-two marks and eighty minor marks of a Buddha. That mind becomes the Buddha. That mind is the Buddha.”
*   "The mind of the Buddha is great compassion. With boundless compassion, it embraces all sentient beings.”
*   "Those who see Immeasurable Life Buddha will also see all the immeasurable Buddhas of the ten directions."
*   “Reciting Namo Amitabha Buddha, because you recite the Buddha's name, in each moment, you eliminate the karmic hindrances of eighty billion kalpas of birth and death.”
*   “If a good man or good woman, upon hearing the name of the Buddha and the names of the two Bodhisattvas, eliminate limitless kalpas of sins. How much more so by being mindful of them! If one is mindful of the Buddha, know that this person is like a lotus flower among humans.”
*  “You must remember these words. To remember these words is to remember the name of Immeasurable Life Buddha.”

**The Great Strength Bodhisattva Chapter on Perfect Enlightenment through Mindfulness of the Buddha (From the Shurangama Sutra)**

*   “If sentient beings are mindful of the Buddha, they will surely see the Buddha in the present and in the future. They will not be far from the Buddha. Without relying on expedient methods, their minds will be opened naturally.”
*   “When asked about perfect enlightenment, I have no choice. By gathering the six senses and maintaining pure mindfulness continuously, I have achieved samadhi. This is foremost.”

**The Universal Worthy Bodhisattva’s Conduct and Vows Chapter (From the Flower Garland Sutra)**

*   **The Ten Great Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva**
    1.  Bowing in Reverence to All Buddhas
    2.  Praising the Tathagatas
    3.  Making Extensive Offerings
    4.  Repenting of Karmic Hindrances
    5.  Rejoicing in the Merits of Others
    6.  Requesting the Turning of the Dharma Wheel
    7.  Requesting the Buddhas to Remain in the World
    8.  Constantly Following the Teachings of the Buddha
    9.  Always Accord with Sentient Beings
    10. Dedicating All Merits Universally

*   “When repenting of karmic hindrances, the Bodhisattva reflects: ‘In countless kalpas in the past, due to greed, anger, and ignorance, through body, speech, and mind, I have committed limitless, countless evil deeds. If these evil deeds had a physical form, the entire space of the universe could not contain them. Now, I will, with my pure three karmas, repent sincerely before all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the cosmos and all realms of infinite particles, vowing never to repeat them and to always uphold pure precepts.’”
*   "If Bodhisattvas can accord with sentient beings, then they are according with offering to all Buddhas. If one respects and serves sentient beings…"

This translation seeks to be both accurate and easily understood by a contemporary English-speaking audience while preserving the spirit and essence of the original Buddhist text.


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional and accurate rendition while maintaining the spirit and tone of the original Buddhist teachings:

**Section One: Respecting and Serving the Tathagata**

*   To show respect and serve the Tathagata is to bring joy to sentient beings. When sentient beings are made joyful, all Tathagatas are thereby made joyful.

*   The Buddhas and Tathagatas take great compassion as their very essence. It is through sentient beings that great compassion arises; through great compassion that the Bodhi mind is born; and through the Bodhi mind that Perfect Enlightenment is achieved.

*   All the evil deeds I have committed in the past are rooted in beginningless greed, anger, and ignorance.  They arose from my body, speech, and mind. I now repent of them all.

*   I vow that as I approach the end of my life, may all obstacles be completely removed. May I see the Buddha Amitabha face to face and be reborn immediately in the Land of Bliss.

*   May the supreme practice of Samantabhadra that I have cultivated, with its immeasurable merit, be dedicated towards all beings drowning in suffering. May they swiftly reach the land of the Buddha of Infinite Light.

**Section Two: Essences of the Sutras**

**The Great Collection Sutra**

*   In the Dharma-Ending Age, billions practice, but few attain the Way. Only by relying on mindfulness of Buddha can one transcend birth and death.

*   If a person simply recites Amitabha, this is called the supreme and profound Chan (Zen) meditation.

*   If there is no Buddha in the world, to serve one’s parents well is to serve the Buddha. Serving one's parents is serving the Buddha.

**The Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Sutra)**

*   Bodhisattvas of the Ten Stages (Bhumis) never abandon mindfulness of the Buddha, from beginning to end.

*   Apart from the Bodhi mind, all actions become the works of demons.

*   Precepts are the very root of unsurpassed Bodhi, nurturing all roots of virtue.

*   The Bodhisattva is like a clear, cool moon, always dwelling in ultimate emptiness. When the defilements of sentient beings' minds are purified, the reflection of Bodhi appears.

*   All sentient beings are endowed with the wisdom and virtuous characteristics of the Tathagata. It is only due to delusive thoughts and attachments that they cannot realize this. If one abandons these delusive thoughts, complete wisdom will immediately manifest.

*   The karmic consequences of killing lead sentient beings to fall into the hell, animal, and hungry ghost realms. After enduring suffering in these three evil paths, upon being reborn as humans, they will still have to endure two types of karmic retribution: firstly, a short lifespan; secondly, much illness.

*   Faith is the source of the Way and the mother of merit, increasing all virtuous dharmas. It removes all doubts, and reveals and opens the supreme path.

*   If one wishes to understand the realm of the Buddha, one should purify one's mind like empty space.

*   Bodhisattvas give all possessions in charity, giving equally to all sentient beings, without expecting reward or seeking fame.

**The Brahma Net Sutra**

*   If a Buddha's disciple, out of compassion, engages in the practice of releasing life, then all men are my fathers and all women are my mothers. In each of my lives, I have been born from them. Thus, all beings of the six realms are my parents. To kill and eat them is to kill my own parents, and also to kill my own past bodies.

*   All earth and water were my past bodies; all fire and wind are my present essence. Therefore, always engage in releasing life. Through life after life, this is an abiding law. Teach others to release life. If one sees people killing animals, one should find ways to rescue and protect them, relieving their suffering.

*   Filial piety towards one's parents, teachers, and the Three Jewels is the most profound Dharma. Filial piety is called the Precept.

*   Bodhisattvas should awaken the Buddha-nature of filial piety and compassion, constantly helping all beings to create happiness and joy.

*   Bodhisattvas should awaken the constant mind of compassion and filial piety and should find means to protect all sentient beings.

*   Bodhisattvas should accept the insults and negative actions on behalf of sentient beings, directing the bad towards themselves and the good towards others.

**The Surangama Sutra**

*   Those who consume meat will fail to achieve any merit they seek.

*   Restraining the mind is the precept; from the precept arises Samadhi (concentration); from Samadhi arises wisdom. This is called the three non-outflow studies.

*   If all those in the world who practice cultivation do not uphold the precepts, they will never be able to leave the three realms.

*   People eat sheep; the sheep dies and becomes a person. The person dies and becomes a sheep. Death after death, life after life, they devour each other, and together they create negative karma that continues into the endless future. You owe me a life; I return the debt. Because of these conditions, they remain in the cycle of birth and death for hundreds and thousands of kalpas.

*   When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, first sever sexual desire. This is the First Definitive and Pure Instruction of the Tathagatas and Buddhas of the Past.

*   When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, next sever killing. This is the Second Definitive and Pure Instruction of the Tathagatas and Buddhas of the Past.

*   When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, afterwards sever stealing. This is the Third Definitive and Pure Instruction of the Tathagatas and Buddhas of the Past.

*   When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, finally sever all major lies. This is the Fourth Definitive and Pure Instruction of the Tathagatas and Buddhas of the Past.

*   You should know that meat-eaters, even if they have mental openings that resemble Samadhi, are all great Rakshasas (demons). When they reach the end of their lives, they will definitely sink into the sea of suffering of birth and death, and are not disciples of the Buddha.

*   If the foundation (causal ground) is not genuine, the result will be crooked.

**The Sutra of Contemplation on the Buddha**

*   Manjushri Bodhisattva's verse: May I, as I reach the end of my life, remove all obstacles. May I see the Buddha Amitabha face to face and be reborn in the Land of Bliss.

**The Buddha's Bequeathed Teaching Sutra**

*   Always be filled with shame and remorse; never abandon it even for a moment. If one abandons shame and remorse, one loses all merit and virtue.

*   Those who are ashamed possess good dharmas. Those who are without shame are no different from birds and beasts.

**The Diamond Sutra**

*   Bodhisattvas should give in charity in this way, without dwelling on any characteristics. Why? Because if a Bodhisattva gives in charity without dwelling on any characteristics, the merit and virtue will be immeasurable.

*   All characteristics are unreal and illusory. If one sees that all characteristics are not characteristics, one sees the Tathagata.

*   All the wise and noble ones are different because of their non-conditioned dharmas.

*   One should awaken such a pure mind, not dwelling on form in creating the mind, nor on sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma in creating the mind. One should create the mind without dwelling anywhere.

*   Wherever this sutra is found, the Buddha is also present. It is worthy of respect, just like a disciple.

*   When faith is pure, one attains the True Reality.

*   To be free of all characteristics is to be called a Buddha.

*   The Tathagata is one who speaks truth, speaks the actual, speaks as it is, does not lie, and does not speak differently.

*   Good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra, if they are despised, this person's past bad karma, which should cause them to fall into evil paths, will be extinguished due to the despise they experience in this life. They will attain Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

*   The past mind is unattainable, the present mind is unattainable, and the future mind is unattainable.

*   This Dharma is equal; it is without higher or lower. This is called Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

*   By cultivating all virtuous dharmas without a self, a person, sentient beings, or lifespan, one will attain Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

*   All dharmas are without a self; one achieves forbearance.

*   Bodhisattvas should not become attached to the merit and virtue they have created. Therefore, it is said that they should not receive merit and virtue.

*   All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows; like dew or lightning. One should contemplate them in this way.

**The Nirvana Sutra**

*   The wise are of two types: one does not create any evil; the other creates evil and then repents. The foolish are also of two types: one creates evil; the other conceals it.

*   Those who eat meat sever the seed of great compassion.

*   Rely on the Dharma, not on the person. Rely on the meaning, not on the words. Rely on wisdom, not on consciousness. Rely on the sutras of definitive meaning, not on the sutras of provisional meaning.

*   All in this world who are born must eventually die. Though life may be immeasurable, it is certain to come to an end. Everything that flourishes will inevitably decline. That which is gathered will be scattered. No dharma is permanent; all things are in constant flux.

*   If sentient beings do not protect and uphold the precepts, how will they see the Buddha-nature? Although all sentient beings have the Buddha-nature, they must uphold the precepts to realize it.

**The Golden Light Sutra**

*   The so-called golden light extinguishes all evil. The gravest of evil karmas created over thousands of kalpas can be completely eliminated if one repents sincerely. I have already taught this method of repentance. The Golden Light Sutra is pure, wondrous, and quickly able to extinguish all karmic obstacles.

**The Medicine Buddha Sutra**

*   Releasing beings brings the removal of illness, the release from difficulties. Releasing life to cultivate blessings enables beings to transcend suffering and escape from all kinds of difficulties.

**The Lankavatara Sutra**

*   Eating meat is the same as committing the act of killing.

*   All sentient beings, from beginningless time, are caught in the cycle of birth and death, without cessation. In that process, they have all been our parents, brothers, sisters, children, and relatives, as well as friends and servants. Having changed forms, they become birds and beasts. How can we kill and eat them?

**The Sutras**

*   Abstaining from killing and releasing life brings the karmic reward of longevity. Moreover, abstaining from killing and releasing life can resolve grievances and dissolve knots, nurture compassion, and moisten the seeds of Bodhi.

**The Sutra in Forty-Two Sections**

*   It is more important for people to be filial to their parents than to serve the heavens, earth, and ghosts. One's two parents are the most sacred of all.

*   A Buddha's disciple, even if he is thousands of miles from me, if he remembers my precepts, will certainly attain the fruit of the path. One who is by my side, though constantly seeing me, will not attain the path if he does not follow my precepts.

*   The Buddha said: "If an evil person, hearing of good, comes to disrupt, you must restrain yourself and not become angry. He brings evil, but the evil falls back on himself."

**The Great Ratnakuta Sutra**

*   It is better to accept the criticism of the wise than to receive the praise of the foolish.

*   The Great Compassion of all the Buddhas and Tathagatas is constantly turning. Why? Because the Buddhas and Tathagatas do not abandon any sentient being.

**The Lotus Sutra**

*   The teachings of all the Buddhas are without difference. There is only the One Vehicle, not two. They use different skillful means to help reveal the supreme meaning.

**The Sutra on the Samadhi of Moonlight**

*   Generosity is the vanguard that breaks through stinginess. It is the entrance to the true path.

**The Sutra of Great Expedient Repaying Kindness**

*   Parents and the Sangha are two fields of merit for all sentient beings. They are the cause for attaining the wondrous fruit of human, heavenly, and nirvanic liberation.

*   The Sangha is the field of merit that transcends the three realms. Parents are the most supreme field of merit within the three realms.

**The Mahavairochana Sutra**

*   The Dharma of the Buddha takes the Bodhi mind as the correct cause and great compassion as its foundation.

**The Upasaka Precepts Sutra**

*   The mind of compassion is the cause of all peace and happiness.

**The Dirgha Agama Sutra**

*   Giving brings merit, compassion brings no resentment, practicing good eliminates evil, and freedom from desire brings no suffering.

**The Miscellaneous Treasure Sutra**

*   If one performs minor evils towards one's parents, one will receive great suffering as retribution. If one makes minor offerings, one will obtain immeasurable merit. You should learn and strive to serve your parents with all your heart.

**The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment**

*   Desire is the root of birth and death.

**The Sutra on the Establishment of Right Mindfulness**

*   The king of death swallows all beings. Old age drinks up youth. Sickness reduces the strength of the robust. The world does not know this.

*   The most excellent mindfulness is the mindfulness of death. By constantly being mindful of death, one develops fear. Because of fear, one does not create evil karma.

**The Earth Store Sutra**

*   Those sentient beings who are not filial to their parents, or even kill them, will fall into the Avici Hell, and will have no hope of release for trillions of eons.

*   Those who draw blood from the Buddha’s body, defame the Triple Jewel, and disrespect the sutras will also fall into the Avici Hell, and will have no hope of release for trillions of eons.

*   If there are men or women who do not perform good deeds, do evil deeds, or even disbelieve in cause and effect; who engage in sexual misconduct or false speech; who are double-tongued or speak harshly; or who defame the Mahayana, all these karmic actions will definitely lead them to evil realms.

*   When one is about to die, relatives should perform virtuous deeds on their behalf, providing resources for their journey ahead.

*   If one can perform more good deeds within the forty-nine days after a person's death, it can enable them to leave the evil paths forever and be born in the human and heavenly realms, enjoying superior joy. The present relatives will also obtain immeasurable benefit.

*   When sentient beings are about to die, be careful not to kill any beings or create any evil conditions, nor make offerings to ghosts or spirits. Why? Because all of this killing and offering has no ability to benefit the deceased. Instead, it creates negative karmic conditions, making the situation worse.

*   When one is dying, there will be hundreds and thousands of evil ghosts and spirits who may transform themselves into your parents or relatives to lead you to evil paths.

*   Family members should perform great offerings, recite sacred sutras, and invoke the names of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Such virtuous conditions can enable the deceased to leave the evil realms, and all demons and ghosts will disperse.

*   If all sentient beings, when nearing the end of life, hear the name of one Buddha or one Bodhisattva, or even one line or verse from a Mahayana sutra, I (Kshitigarbha) observe that such people, apart from the five heinous offenses of killing parents, killing an Arhat, etc., even minor evils which might lead them to evil paths are immediately liberated.

*   All sentient beings, present and future, whether heavenly beings, humans, men or women, who simply invoke the name of one Buddha, will generate immeasurable merit and virtue, let alone invoke many names. These beings will receive great benefits both at their birth and death and will never fall into the evil paths.

*   If someone is about to die, and even one member of their family invokes the name of a Buddha in a loud voice for that person, then apart from the five heinous offenses, all the rest of that person’s karmic retribution will be extinguished.

**The Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom (Mahaprajnaparamita Shastra)**

*   Among all offenses, the act of killing is the most serious. Among all virtues, releasing life is foremost.

*   The Dharma of the Buddha values practice, not the absence of practice. If one can be diligent in practice, even with little learning, one will enter the path sooner.

*   To accomplish the great matter of adorning the Buddha lands, the merit and virtue from one’s individual practice alone cannot succeed. Therefore, it is necessary to have the power of vows. It is like the strength of an ox that can pull a cart, but needs a driver to reach its destination.

*   If one lacks shame and remorse, one loses all merits. Those who are ashamed possess good dharmas. Those who are without shame are no different from birds and beasts.

**The Jataka Sutra (Story of the Buddha's Previous Lives)**

*   Even if a person carries their father on one shoulder and their mother on the other for their entire life, without ever resting, supplying them with clothes, food, medicine, and all necessities, they still cannot repay the profound kindness of their parents.

**The Sutra on the Contemplation of the Mind Ground**

*   Because of the kindness of a compassionate father and a loving mother who nurtured them, all men and women find peace and happiness. The kindness of the compassionate father is as high as a mountain, and the kindness of the loving mother is as deep as the ocean.

*   When one’s parents are alive, one is considered rich. When one’s parents are gone, one is considered poor. When one’s parents are alive, it is like daylight; when one’s parents are gone, it is like darkness. Therefore, you should diligently cultivate filial piety and nourish your parents. When one makes offerings to the Buddha, the merit and virtue is the same as when one serves one's parents.

**The Dhammapada (Verses on the Dharma)**

*   Even if one uses one’s entire life to diligently serve the gods of the world, making offerings of elephants and horses to the heavens, it is not as good as practicing one moment of compassion.

**The Sutra on the Unborn Enemy (Ajatasatru Sutra)**

*   The greatest good is filial piety, and the greatest evil is harming one’s parents.

**The Sutra of Impermanence**

*   Even the wondrous Mount Meru will be destroyed by the end of an eon. Even the deep, bottomless ocean will dry up. The earth, the sun, and the moon will all return to nothing. No single dharma has ever escaped being swallowed by impermanence.

**The Sutra of the Eight Realizations of Great Beings**

*   Much desire brings suffering. The weariness of birth and death arises from greed. Having few desires leads to non-action, and freedom of body and mind.

**The Sutra on the Conditions of the Thousand Buddhas**

*   Giving is a wonderful accumulation that produces limitless rewards. All gods and humans have been established by giving. Therefore, wise individuals should practice giving.

**The Sutra on the Buddha’s Healing**

*   If you are able to correct yourself, then teaching others will not be difficult. To teach others, you must first teach yourself.

**The Sutra on Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin)**

*   The Bodhi mind is the mind of great enlightenment; it is a mind of equality and a mind of universality.

**The Agamas**

*   If there is no love or attachment in the world, then there will be no worries, suffering, or vexations. When all worries and suffering are eliminated, it is like a lotus flower that is not stained by water.

**Section Three: The Essential Teachings of Past Masters**

**Master Shandao’s Teachings**

*   Gradually, the skin becomes like a chicken, the hair becomes white, and walking becomes slow and labored. Though one possesses mountains of gold and jade, one cannot escape the decline of old age and sickness. No matter how much happiness you may have, impermanence is sure to arrive. The only true path is cultivation, just reciting Amitabha Buddha.

*   The great sages, out of compassion, directly advise one to specifically recite the name because it is easy to recite, and easy to sustain. If you can sustain it with every single thought, with your entire life as the limit, then ten will certainly be reborn out of ten, and one hundred out of one hundred.

*   When ordinary people reach the end of their lives, they must not be afraid of death. Constantly contemplate that this body is filled with suffering and impurity. If one can give up this illusory body and be reborn in a virtuous realm, that is an agreeable matter.

*   When one is ill, one should only contemplate impermanence and wait for death with a single mind.

*   If one abandons single-minded recitation and engages in miscellaneous practices, there is little hope of success. If one in a hundred might achieve it, if one in a thousand, three or four might succeed.

*   This is the true path to entering the Buddha way. The cultivation of other practices is indirect and difficult. Only this path enables one to quickly transcend birth and death.

*   One may ask: “Does reciting Buddha enable one to be reborn in the Pure Land?” The master replied, “As you recite, so shall your wish be fulfilled.”

*   *Namo* means to take refuge and also includes the meaning of vowing to dedicate merit. *Amitabha Buddha* means the actual practice. With these meanings, rebirth is certain.

**Master Yongming Yanshou’s Teachings**

*   **The Four Considerations:**

    Those with Chan (Zen) but no Pure Land practice, nine out of ten will go astray. When illusory states appear, they will instantly be led away by them.

    Those without Chan but with Pure Land practice, ten out of ten will be reborn. Once you see Amitabha, why worry about not awakening?

    Those with both Chan and Pure Land practice are like tigers with horns. In this life they are teachers of people; in the next life they will become Buddhas.

    Those with neither Chan nor Pure Land practice will be on beds of iron and pillars of copper. For thousands of kalpas, for hundreds of lives, they will have no refuge.

*   Those who sincerely cultivate must aim to be reborn in the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss, and single-mindedly and sincerely recite the name of Amitabha Buddha.

    This one thought is my original teacher.

    This one thought is a manifested Buddha.

    This one thought is a mighty general who can destroy hell.

    This one thought is a sword of preciousness that can cut through all evils.

    This one thought is the direct path for transcending the three realms.

    This one thought is a bright lamp that dispels darkness.

    This one thought is a compassionate boat that crosses the sea of suffering.

    This one thought is the good medicine for leaving birth and death.

    This one thought is Amitabha in one's original nature.

    This one thought is the Pure Land that is only mind.

    Just keep this one phrase of Amitabha Buddha in your heart, do not let it be lost. May it constantly be present in every thought. In every thought, do not leave it. When you are at ease, recite it. When you are in trouble, recite it. When you are happy, recite it. When you are in pain, recite it. When you are alive, recite it. When you are dying, recite it. If you recite in this way, clearly and distinctly without being obscured, why ask others and seek another path home?

**Master Lianchi’s Teachings**

*   The matter of birth and death is a great matter.

*   I only know how to recite the Buddha’s name, I have no other skill.

*   Nagarjuna, having read the Avatamsaka Sutra in the Dragon Palace, vowed to be reborn in the Pure Land. Samantabhadra, being the eldest son of the Avatamsaka Sutra, vowed to be reborn in the Pure Land. Manjushri and Samantabhadra both assisted Vairochana and are known as the Three Sages of the Avatamsaka Sutra. They all vowed to be reborn in the Pure Land. All of these things are based on clear evidence, as bright as the sun and stars.

*   Those who are clever and eloquent, engaging in empty talk about Prajna, after they have eaten their fill of meat, come to the monks to speak about Chan, these are demons. It is noble to be foolish in being a fool. I truly take stock of myself. It is better to be an old vegetarian devotee than to be an old demon follower.

*   The group should recite the Buddha's name honestly. Do not create strange practices; do not ruin my rules.

*   Scattered thoughts are an illness; reciting the Buddha is the medicine. Reciting the Buddha is the proper cure for scattered thoughts. The reason that it cannot cure them is because the recitation of the Buddha’s name is not sincere enough. When scattered thoughts arise, you must work harder to recite, word by word, phrase by phrase, purely and without wavering. Then the scattered thoughts will naturally stop.

*   When myriad thoughts come flying, this is the time to work hard. Return and let go, let go and return. After a long time, when your practice is pure, naturally, wandering thoughts will not arise.

*   Those who study the Buddha do not have to focus on appearance, they should value genuine practice.

    Lay practitioners do not have to wear monastic robes. Those who have hair may recite the Buddha's name while wearing their normal clothes. There is no need to bang on wood blocks or drums. Those who like quietness may recite the Buddha's name silently. There is no need to gather in groups. Those who fear trouble can recite the Buddha’s name behind closed doors. There is no need to enter a temple to listen to the sutras. Those who are literate may follow the teachings and recite the Buddha’s name.

*   Burning incense for a thousand miles cannot compare to peacefully sitting at home and reciting the Buddha’s name.

    Making offerings to evil teachers cannot compare to being filial to your parents and reciting the Buddha’s name.

    Making friends with demons cannot compare to reciting the Buddha’s name in solitude and purity.

    Making preparations for the future cannot compare to creating merit in the present and reciting the Buddha’s name.

    Making vows for protection cannot compare to repenting and reforming while reciting the Buddha’s name.

    Learning the literature of external paths cannot compare to reciting the Buddha’s name without knowing a single character.

    Speaking vainly about Chan principles cannot compare to honestly upholding the precepts and reciting the Buddha's name.

    Wishing for spiritual powers from ghosts and demons cannot compare to having correct faith in cause and effect and reciting the Buddha’s name.

*   Master Bianrong taught Master Lianchi: "You should hold onto your own responsibilities, do not be greedy for fame and profit, and do not seek out connections. Just be clear about cause and effect and recite the Buddha's name single-mindedly."

*   What is taught by the entire Tripitaka is nothing more than precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Reciting the Buddha's name is precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Why should you follow every word and line to read the entire Tripitaka? Time passes quickly and life is short. I wish everyone would take the Pure Land practice as their most urgent matter.

*   I am an inferior commoner who is content in my ignorance. The only thing I have done throughout my life is to recite the six characters "Namo Amitabha Buddha". Now that I am old, if anyone asks, I will certainly answer this way.

*   Wandering thoughts are an illness, reciting the Buddha is the medicine. A long-term illness cannot be cured by a single pill. Accumulation of scattered thoughts cannot be eliminated by one moment of recitation. Do not worry about the flight of scattered thoughts. Just value reciting the Buddha sincerely.

*   The cause of illnesses often comes from killing. Therefore, releasing life is so important.

*   Families that abstain from killing are protected by virtuous deities. Calamities will be removed, lifespans will be extended, children and grandchildren will be wise and filial, and all types of auspiciousness will arise. It is difficult to list them all. If, further, one engages in releasing life and invoking the Buddha, not only will one increase one's merit and virtue, but one will definitely be reborn according to one's wish, escape the cycle of rebirth, and enter the stage of non-retrogression.

*   In the world, the most important thing is life. In all the world, the most tragic thing is killing and harming.

*   Giving all has its karmic consequences; nothing is without evidence. It is recorded in the books and can be seen by our eyes and heard by our ears. I wish that all people may develop a compassionate mind for all that they see, and give up non-lasting wealth to engage in expedient actions. If you show favor to many lives, you will accumulate great hidden merit. Even if you give benefit to an insect, it is certainly not something other than good.

*   Those who release life may increase their good fortune, extend their lifespan, be free from impending danger, recover from chronic illnesses, be reborn in the heavens, or attain the fruit of the path. According to their actions, their karmic rewards will be bestowed. However, those who perform good acts and bring forth auspiciousness do not expect karmic rewards! They do not seek karmic rewards, but the karmic rewards arrive on their own. Cause and effect are inevitable, and cannot be avoided. Those who engage in releasing life should know this.

*   If the mind is great and the virtue is deep, how will the effects manifest? Benefiting others is the practice of the Bodhisattva. Using this type of practice to help in one's cultivation, is like a boat that catches a favorable wind. One will surely quickly reach the shore of Nirvana. Of the Three Blessings of the Pure Land practice, compassion and non-killing are among them. If one abstains from killing and also releases life, and further uses the Dharma to lead beings to be reborn in the Pure Land, with such a mind, when your karmic merit is complete, you will certainly step onto the nine grades of lotus platforms. I sincerely urge the people of the world not to disbelieve my words because I am of little virtue and influence.

*   I urge all the people of the world, when you see a living being, to awaken the mind of compassion, to give up your worldly wealth, and perform such expedient acts.

*   The Brahma Net Sutra considers releasing life to be a constant Dharma. The constant means the diamond body and infinite life.

*   I advise everyone that when your parents are alive, you should encourage them to recite the Buddha’s name. When your parents die, you should recite the Buddha’s name for them for three years. Those who are unable to do so may do it for one year or forty-nine days. A filial child should know this if they wish to repay the nurturing grace of their parents.

*   When one's parents leave behind defilements, the son's path is completed.

*   To teach people to release life is to have them realize the principle of endless lives and to attain the diamond body and infinite life.

**Master Ouyi’s Teachings**

*   The method of reciting the Buddha's name has no particular strangeness or uniqueness. It is simply a matter of having profound faith, earnest vows, and the power of practice.

*   When one recites Amitabha Buddha fluently, the entire Tripitaka, with its twelve divisions, and its ultimate teachings are all contained within. All seventeen hundred gong-an and their upward pointing mechanisms are contained within. All three thousand rules of deportment, the eighty thousand subtle practices, and the three types of pure precepts are contained within.

*   Truly being able to recite the Buddha’s name, letting go of body, mind, and the world is true great giving.

    Truly being able to recite the Buddha’s name, no longer giving rise to greed, anger, or delusion is true great upholding of the precepts.

    Truly being able to recite the Buddha’s name, not remembering right or wrong, self or others, is true great forbearance.

Okay, here's the translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining the tone and depth of the original Chinese:

**Translation:**

Truly being able to recite the Buddha's name without the slightest interruption or mixing it with other thoughts is great diligence.

Truly being able to recite the Buddha's name without wild thoughts running rampant is great meditative concentration.

Truly being able to recite the Buddha's name without being misled by other paths is great wisdom.

※ That which is capable of holding (the name), is the initial awakening. That which is held (the name itself), is the original awakening. Now, directly holding it, there is no Buddha outside of the holding, and no holding outside of the Buddha. The ability and the held are not two. Thus, the initial awakening aligns with the original awakening, reaching complete and ultimate awakening.

※ From beginningless time until the end of the future, we never cease to have thoughts. Even if the mind becomes ashen and enters a state of non-thought, it still falls into the 84,000 withered and chaotic thoughts. But if one thinks of hell, one becomes a person of the hell realm; if one thinks of hungry ghosts, one becomes a person of the hungry ghost realm; and even so, if one thinks of the Buddha, then one becomes a person of the Buddha realm. This principle is supremely clear. Therefore, the *Zong Jing Lu* (Record of the Source Mirror) says: "One thought in accord, one thought Buddha; each thought in accord, each thought Buddha."

※  A virtuous master who had attained realization asked me about the essence of the mind. I said, "The essence of the mind is none other than reciting the Buddha's name."

※  If a person wholeheartedly recites Amitabha Buddha's name, it is called the unsurpassed, profound, and wonderful meditation. When one wholeheartedly visualizes seeing the Buddha, one is in the realm of the non-arising, non-ceasing Dharma.

※  The Samadhi of reciting the Buddha's name is called the King of Jewels Samadhi, the king among all Samadhis. All Samadhis – partial, complete, provisional, and real – flow from this Samadhi, and all return to this Samadhi. This is the essence of the most perfect and immediate teaching, and also a skillful expedient suitable for all three capacities.

※  This Dharma-door of holding the name, though seemingly for those of middle and lower capacities, is still the most immediate and complete. The name that is held, regardless of understanding or not, its substance is none other than the one realm and three truths. The mind that holds it, regardless of whether it has reached understanding or not, its substance is none other than the one mind and three contemplations.

※ The name is the Dharma realm, the Middle Way, the true reality. It encompasses all and contains all; there is no Dharma outside of the name.

※ Killing beings is killing all the future Buddhas in your own mind; liberating beings is liberating all the future Buddhas in your own mind. If you liberate all the future Buddhas in your own mind, you are in true Buddha-recitation Samadhi. Practicing this Samadhi is constantly turning the *Lotus Sutra* hundreds of millions of times.

※  If you wish to realize the Buddha-mind from the human mind and transform the turbulence of the kalpa into a Pure Land, there is no method more effective than liberating beings. The Dharma of liberating beings should be expanded and prolonged. One cup of water cannot extinguish a cartload of burning firewood; but if we each offer a cup of water, then another cup, and more, the combined water will certainly extinguish the fire. Now, the karma of killing is rampant, due to shared karmic causes. What can extinguish it if not the water of compassionate Samadhi?

※  View all kinds of adverse and difficult circumstances as genuine opportunities for benefit. View all favorable circumstances, like fame, gain, sensual pleasures, praise, and offerings as poison and poisoned arrows.

※  When worldly people discuss life and death, few are not alarmed and apprehensive. The reason they often cannot truly deal with life and death is that they can't let go of their immediate daily affairs. And the reason they cannot let go of these affairs is simply that they have not thoroughly seen the suffering of life and death.

※  When a person is deeply aware of the great matter of life and death, piercing through all worldly attachments – whether favorable or adverse, realizing they are all false, unreal, and as empty as flowers that pass before the eyes – and single-mindedly holds onto the practice of upholding the precepts, repenting, and sincerely trusting in the Three Jewels, they will live and die together with that faith.

※   Focus on your own faults, not blaming others for theirs.

※   Why not take advantage of this time to let go of illusory dreams and worldly labors, and diligently cultivate precepts, meditative concentration, and wisdom?

※   Within the three realms, there is nothing that is not a prison. Temporary happiness ultimately returns to impermanence.

※   Extremely intelligent people are often misled by their cleverness, and therefore cannot recite the Buddha's name and seek rebirth in the West. But foolish women are often willing to detest the suffering of the Saha world and deeply seek liberation. One should realize that they are truly not foolish, but possess great wisdom. Distinguish good from bad, and do not deceive yourself.

※  Only with a deep mind of upholding the precepts and reciting the Buddha's name, if upheld purely and recited sincerely, you will naturally come to a sudden belief. This is what is called using other expedient methods to illuminate the ultimate truth.

※   The more knowledge one has, the more arrogant one becomes; the longer the habit, the further from the Way one goes. It is truly frightening to increase one's own views through much study.

※   For each degree you diminish your worldly attachments, you gain an equal degree of strength in the Dharma. For each degree you lighten your attachment to this Saha world, you gain an equal degree of security in your rebirth in the West. This matter is only a question for your own heart; there's no need to ask learned individuals.

※   If one frequently contemplates being sick, worldly desires will gradually diminish.
If one frequently contemplates death, the aspiration for the path will arise naturally.

※   The Dharma declines not from lack of external protectors, but from lack of internal upholders.

※  If one has the slightest intention of worldly fame and gain, the Buddhadharma will merely become worldly dharma, which is truly lamentable.

※  If you wish to become a sage, a worthy, or a Buddha, you must accept scolding and abuse as if drinking sweet nectar, and meet adversity as if encountering a treasure.

※  Upholding the precepts is the foundation. The Pure Land is the destination. Observing the mind is essential. Good friends are the support.

※  A finger snap to return to the Land of Peace, this Jambudvipa should not be lingered in.

※  Take refuge in the great compassionate father, to swiftly exit from the realm of Saha.

※  The method of counting recitations is suitable for all three capacities. The highest may not be hindered by it, the lowest must use it. Therefore it is generally used as a means of discipline; thus, the sharp minded may readily attain one pointedness through this, and the dull minded will not lose the wholesome roots as a result. If, on the other hand, one were to say that principle and practice are one and that one does not need to count, I fear that with few of the sharp-minded and many of the foolish, very few could ever avoid forgetting.

※ Repentance, dedication, and further recitation of the Buddha's name—there is no undertaking that will not succeed with these.

※  Of all the methods of Buddha recitation, the simplest and most secure is to have faith and aspiration, and solely uphold the name. One need not practice visualizations, nor engage in contemplative investigation.

※  With the single practice of holding the name now, we need only hold straight and directly, without double-mindedness. Firmly believe that the Pure Land is attainable, make a firm vow to be reborn, and take holding the name as the primary practice, and the six perfections as supporting practices. This can be guaranteed for anyone who cultivates it; ten thousand cultivators will go.

※  When the Buddhadharma flourishes, people strive for substance. When it declines, everyone competes for fame. Hence, when seeking liberation from birth and death and the attainment of Bodhi, contending for fame inevitably leads to selfishness and will increase the karmic influence of Mara. Those with aspirations must thoroughly examine this.

*Extracts from the Essential Explanation of the Amitabha Sutra*

※ Among all expedients, to seek the most direct, most complete, and immediate one, there is none better than reciting the Buddha's name and seeking rebirth in the Pure Land.

※ Among all the Dharma-doors of reciting the Buddha's name, the simplest and most secure is to have faith and aspiration, and solely hold the name.

※ Faith, aspiration, and holding the name are the fundamental principles of cultivation. Without faith, aspiration cannot arise; without aspiration, practice cannot be guided; without the wondrous practice of holding the name, one cannot fulfill one's aspirations and realize what one believes.

※ The *Miaozong* says: When taking and discarding reaches its extreme, it is not different from not taking or discarding. If one doesn't engage in taking and discarding, but simply focuses on not taking and not discarding, then that is adhering to theory and abandoning practice. If one abandons practice, the theory is not complete either.

※  The name summons the virtue. The virtue is inconceivable, and so the name is also inconceivable. The merits of the name are inconceivable, which enables it to scatter the seeds of Buddhahood and uplift those who hold it to the level of non-regression.

※  Only the single practice of holding the name is the most accessible to all capacities and the easiest to begin with.

※  In the future, when the Dharma is near extinction, this Sutra will be especially preserved for one hundred years to broadly liberate all sentient beings. It is the *Agada* medicine (elixir) that can cure all diseases. It is absolute, perfect, and inconceivable.

※  The profound treasures of the *Avatamsaka*, the secret essence of the *Lotus Sutra*, the heart of all Buddhas, and the compass of all Bodhisattva practices, all lie within this.

※  Whether one is reborn depends entirely on the presence or absence of faith and aspiration. The grade of rebirth depends entirely on how deep and profound one holds the name.

※ Amitabha, correctly translated, means "immeasurable," which is inherently indescribable. The original teacher used the two meanings of light and life to encompass all that is immeasurable. Light pervades all ten directions horizontally, and life extends infinitely through the three periods of time vertically. These horizontal and vertical dimensions intertwine to become the very essence of the Dharma realm. This essence is taken as the body and land of Amitabha, and it is also taken as the very name of Amitabha.

※ The name of Amitabha Buddha is the inherent rational nature of all sentient beings. Holding the name is the initial awakening combining with the original awakening. The initial and original are not two. The sentient being and the Buddha are not two. Therefore, one thought in accord, one thought Buddha; each thought in accord, each thought Buddha.

※ Throughout Shakyamuni’s life of teaching, only the *Avatamsaka Sutra* clarifies the perfect fulfillment in one lifetime, and the cause for that perfect fulfillment lies in the final chapter of the *Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's Vow*, where the ten great vows guide one to rebirth in the Land of Peace, and this also persuades the assemblies of the Flower Store Sea.

※ What the *Avatamsaka Sutra* proclaims is all contained in this Sutra.

※ Only by having faith in the Buddha’s power can one deeply believe in the merit of the name. Only by holding the name can one deeply believe in the inconceivable nature of one's own mind. Only with this deep belief can one give rise to great aspiration.

※ Deep faith and aspiration are the unsurpassed Bodhi. With these faith and aspiration combined, one has the guiding light of the Pure Land.

※ If faith and aspiration are firm, even ten recitations or one recitation at the end of life will ensure rebirth. If there is no faith and aspiration, even if one holds the name as solidly as an iron wall, impermeable to wind and rain, one cannot be reborn.

※ Amitabha Buddha’s name is the great name that embodies all virtues. By using the name to summon the virtues, nothing is left out. Therefore, upholding the name is the main practice, without needing to engage in visualization or contemplative investigation, making it the simplest and most direct.

※ Faith, aspiration, and practice are not successive stages, nor are they fixed into three distinct aspects. Without aspiration, practice cannot be considered genuine faith. Without practice, faith cannot be considered genuine aspiration. Without faith and aspiration, there is no genuine practice.

※ The three – faith, aspiration, and practice – are fully present in each and every utterance. Thus, it is called the “cause and condition of many wholesome roots and meritorious virtues.” The *Contemplation Sutra* states that by calling the Buddha's name, one eliminates the sins of eighty billion kalpas of birth and death in each and every thought. That is what this means.

※ This profound and wondrous Dharma-door utterly shatters all idle debates and eradicates all opinions. Only those like Asvaghosha, Nagarjuna, Zhiyi, and Yongming were able to completely bear the burden. Those with worldly wisdom and debating skills, learned scholars, and Chan practitioners who try to fathom it through thinking and reasoning, will only go further astray. They are not as good as foolish men and women who genuinely recite the Buddha’s name, who can secretly connect with the Buddha’s wisdom and unconsciously align with the wondrous path.

※ This sutra is the realm of the Buddhas, and only the Buddhas can truly disseminate it.

※ Upholding the name of one Buddha is the same as being protected and supported by all Buddhas. It is no different than holding the names of all Buddhas.

※ Aspiration is the essence of faith and the key to practice. It is particularly important. When aspiration arises, faith and practice are included within it. Therefore, it is urged with sincerity three times.

※  One utterance of Amitabha Buddha's name is the same as the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment that Sakyamuni, the original teacher, attained in the five turbid and evil ages.

※  Now, this fruit of enlightenment is given entirely to impure and evil sentient beings, which is the realm practiced by the Buddhas. Only Buddhas can fathom it completely. It cannot be believed or understood by those of the nine realms through their own power.

*Instructions from Master Xingce*

※  In cultivation, there are no essential techniques other than generating true faith and aspiration and solely focusing on continuous recitation. Then all practices will naturally be on the right path.

※  Zen Master Zhenxie said, “Buddhas pass on to Buddhas, patriarchs transmit to patriarchs; this is the one and only matter, there is nothing else.”  The World Honored One delivered teachings for 49 years through 300 assemblies, and yet he praised the teaching of the Pure Land so earnestly. Is this not the most expeditious path to transcend the mundane and enter sainthood!

※  All my fellow practitioners, should deeply realize the dangers of the Saha world and seek to swiftly escape the six paths of transmigration, abandon the impure and embrace the pure. Do not chase after empty fame or cling to empty views. Do not be confused by the verbal Samadhi of high-hatted Chan practitioners.  Do not seek quick results which will invite demonic interference. Constantly take Buddha recitation as the primary practice and diligently cultivate all virtues as supporting practices. Maintain pure recitation continuously, and let aspiration and practice support each other. Then everything will naturally be stable and assured.

※  If one does not solely focus on recitation and seek rebirth in that Land, one will definitely be subject to karmic flow and suffer immeasurable pain.

※ Recite the Buddha’s name with one mind to seek swift rebirth in the Land of Bliss.

※  At the very end of the Avatamsaka Sutra, the ten great vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva lead one to rebirth in the Land of Utmost Bliss. He urges and entreats with earnestness and repeated emphasis, fully expressed in the chapter on practice and vows.

※  Solely reciting Amitabha Buddha of the West, with all wholesome roots, dedicate them with the aspiration to be reborn, which will definitely result in non-regression, to be close to Amitabha Buddha.

※ Amitabha Buddha is the embodiment of the Dharma realm. The Land of Utmost Bliss is the sea of the Lotus Store. Seeing one Buddha is seeing limitless Buddhas. Being reborn in one land is being reborn in limitless lands. Reciting the name of one Buddha is reciting the name of all Buddhas. Thus, it is being protected and supported by all Buddhas. This is because the Dharma body is not two, the sentient being and the Buddha are not two, and the ability to recite and that which is recited are not two.

※ Cultivate genuine aspiration, and generate a joyful aspiration. View the three realms as prisons, the home as shackles, sounds and sights as poison, fame and gain as fetters, and one’s past decades of prosperity and misfortune as nothing more than a dream. View this lifespan in the Saha world as being in temporary lodging. Firmly believe in swiftly leaving this behind. With one mind recite the Buddha's name and aspire to be jointly reborn in the Pure Land.

※ Like a prisoner being led to the market to be executed, every step is closer to death. One must diligently strive day and night, regardless of summer or winter, with each utterance of the Great Name continuously without break.  Rebirth in the Pure Land is definitely attainable. Be mindful not to start out enthusiastically and then become lax.

※ Only seek liberation and do not seek worldly blessings, nor meritorious virtues, wisdom, eloquence, or enlightenment. Also, do not make vows such as being a monk in every life to propagate the Dharma. Only aspire to be reborn in that Land upon death, to be freed from the suffering of birth and death.

※ Holding the name is valued for its single-mindedness, without interruption or mixing. It's not necessarily better to recite quickly or a lot. Simply recite the name neither too fast nor too slow, clearly and distinctly in your heart. When dressing, eating, walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, continuously recite the Great Name with close attention. Such recitation can be considered single-minded and diligent.

※  The Dharma-door of Buddha recitation relies on the power of that Buddha's vows. So it doesn't matter whether one is wise or not, of high, medium, or low capacity. If one only holds the name with single-mindedness, for seven days or even one day, one will have the cause and condition of many wholesome roots and meritorious virtues, one will be received by Amitabha Buddha and his assembly, and one will be protected by all Buddhas in the ten directions. It is an inconceivable and unique expedient, and because of its uniqueness, it is superior.

※ This most superior and unique Dharma-door has been earnestly taught by Shakyamuni and praised with the broad tongues of countless Buddhas. Surely, it would not be to deceive us.

※  There are countless Dharma-doors in Buddhism. Some are difficult, and some are easy. If you seek ease and swift attainment, you should recite the Buddha’s name – calling Amitabha Buddha’s name – you will swiftly attain unsurpassed Bodhi.

※  In this world of five turbidities, seeking non-regression is very difficult. If you believe in the Samadhi of Buddha recitation, and take refuge in the Buddha’s vow power, by being embraced and received, you are assured of rebirth. Without relying on other expedients, your heart will naturally open, and you will not regress in any lifetime, and the Buddha stage is within reach.

※  The Pure Land broadly embraces all capacities, and all can attain non-regression.

※  Realize that time is like a fleeting stream, and old age is creeping in day by day. Do not waste your precious time. In addition to your set schedule, when you have spare time, simply add more recitations of the Buddha's name. As for mantras like the *Shurangama* and the *Great Compassion Mantra*, that’s not necessary at this time.

※ For each degree you lessen your love and attachment, your practice towards the Pure Land will mature an equal degree.

※ The sutras say, "The ocean of the Buddhas’ perfect wisdom arises from the thoughts of the mind." When a sentient being thinks of the Buddha, that mind is the thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics of a Buddha. That mind *becomes* the Buddha, that mind *is* the Buddha. These few words are the secret essence of the Samadhi of reciting the Buddha’s name. All visualization practices flow from this.

※  The Great Collection Sutra says: If a person only recites Amitabha Buddha's name, it is called the unsurpassed, profound, and wondrous meditation. When one wholeheartedly visualizes seeing the Buddha, one is in the realm of the non-arising, non-ceasing Dharma.

※ Zen Master Zhijue said: “One thought in accord, one thought Buddha; each thought in accord, each thought Buddha.”

※ The Buddha is the principle of the original awakening, and recitation is the wisdom of the initial awakening. Therefore, know that when we are correctly reciting the Buddha’s name, the initial and original awakenings combine, principle and wisdom merge, the ability to do and the doing itself disappear, and self and other are not two. There is no Buddha outside of the recitation to be the object of the recitation. There is no recitation outside of the Buddha that is able to recite upon the Buddha. This transcends feeling and view, transcends language and conceptualization. Nothing can be more direct, complete, and immediate than this. Outside of Buddha recitation, is there any other wondrous contemplation to attain?

※ How much more of your life remains? The most stable and easiest path is to urge each other with these six true words. This is an extraordinary prescription from the sea, able to cure any severe illness. It treats both the symptoms and the root. It is suitable for both urgent and gradual situations. The most important thing is deep faith, diligent practice, and focused recitation.

※  The sutras broadly praise the Pure Land, saying that it has: “Inconceivable merit,” “a Dharma that is difficult to believe in this world,” “protection from all Buddhas,” “unsurpassed, profound, and wonderful meditation,” “unique and extraordinary expedient,” “the king of all Samadhis,” and so on. However, sentient beings in this degenerated age tend to harbor doubts when it comes to the Buddha-recitation Dharma, even going so far as to destroy others' pure faith and obstruct their good practices. People with weak blessings and little wisdom tend to have these kinds of habits.

※  Be serene, as if you are just passing through, maintain a long-term vegetarian diet to serve the Buddha, be content with little and without desires, and diligently practice to inquire into the Tao.

※ A practitioner, without proper faith and aspiration for rebirth in the West, who broadly cultivates other virtuous practices, is called an enemy to his own liberation for future lives.

*Instructions from Master Chewu*

※ To truly resolve the matter of birth and death, arouse the Bodhi mind, and with deep faith and aspiration, hold the Buddha’s name. These sixteen words form the essential framework of the Buddha-recitation Dharma-door.

※ If one does not generate the true mind to resolve the matter of birth and death, all instructions are merely idle talk.

※ It should be like experiencing the loss of one's parents, or like saving a burning head.

※ Once the great mind is aroused, one should engage in great practice. Among all practices, the easiest to begin, the easiest to achieve, the most secure, and most complete is none other than to have deep faith and aspiration and to hold the Buddha’s name.

※ The phrase “holding the name” means to firmly embrace it and keep it at heart, without forgetting it for even a moment. If the mind is interrupted even for a single thought, it is not truly holding the name. Continuous recitation, without mixing or interruptions, is true diligence. If diligence continues, one will gradually enter the state of one-mindedness without confusion, and will thus accomplish the practice for the Pure Land.

※ One-mindedness without confusion is the final destination of the Pure Land practice and the great gate to the Pure Land. If one does not enter this gate, one is not truly safe. Practitioners should strive for this.

※  1.  To truly resolve the matter of birth and death and arouse the Bodhi mind is the common path for learning the Way.
  2.  With deep faith and aspiration, holding the Buddha's name is the true essence of the Pure Land.
  3.  Focusing one's mind and reciting attentively is the expedient means to begin.
  4.  Subduing present afflictions is the essential task for cultivating the mind.
  5.  Solely upholding the four heavy precepts is the foundation for entering the Way.
  6.  Engaging in various austere practices is an aid to cultivating the Way.
  7.  One-mindedness without confusion is the final destination of the Pure Land.
  8.  Various auspicious signs are the proof of rebirth.

  The above eight points should each be thoroughly explained. Those who cultivate the Pure Land should understand them.

※ The essence of all Dharma-doors is to clarify the mind. The essence of all practices is to purify the mind. And yet, the essential method for clarifying the mind is none other than Buddha recitation. When one remembers and recites the Buddha, one will definitely see the Buddha in this life and the next, and without relying on expedients, one’s heart will naturally open. Is this not the essence of clarifying the mind? Moreover, the essence of purifying the mind is also none other than Buddha recitation.  One thought in accord, one thought Buddha; each thought in accord, each thought Buddha. Like a pure pearl dropped into turbid water, the turbid water cannot help but become clear. Like a Buddha's name cast into a chaotic mind, the chaotic mind cannot help but become Buddha. Is this not the essence of purifying the mind?

※  One utterance of the Buddha's name encompasses the essence of both enlightenment and practice. When enlightenment is mentioned, faith is included within it. When practice is mentioned, realization is included within it. Faith, understanding, practice, and realization include the essences of both the great and small vehicles, all the sutras without exception. Then isn't one utterance of Amitabha truly the essential Way?

※  Our present moment of mind is entirely true and becomes false, yet entirely false and becomes true.  It is unchanging all day long, yet ever subject to conditions. If one does not follow the conditions of the Buddha realm to recite the Buddha's name, then one will be reciting the names of the nine realms. If not reciting the three vehicles, one will be reciting the six mundane realms. If not reciting the human and heavenly realms, one will be reciting the three evil paths. If not reciting the ghost and animal realms, one will be reciting the hell realm. Because as long as there is a mind, there cannot be no thoughts. The nature of the mind without thought is only truly realized by the Buddha. Even at the level of an enlightened Bodhisattva, all have thoughts. Every thought arises, one will fall into the ten realms. There is no thought that exists outside of the ten realms, because outside of the ten Dharma realms there is nothing. Every thought that arises is a condition for a new life. If one understands this principle and does not recite the Buddha's name, then it is unlikely.

※  All realms are karmically conditioned and are manifestations of the mind.

※ The two phrases from the *Contemplation Sutra*, "This mind becomes Buddha, this mind *is* Buddha," are even more direct and immediate than the Chan saying, “Directly pointing to the human mind, seeing the nature, and becoming Buddha.” How is this so? Because seeing one's nature is difficult, and becoming Buddha is easy. What is seeing one’s nature? It is when one leaves the realm of thought and consciousness, and a bright light shines forth. Only then is it seeing one’s nature, and it is therefore difficult. What is becoming Buddha? It is holding the Buddha’s name and contemplating the rewards and retributions of the Buddha. This is how one becomes Buddha. It is therefore easy.

※  The Sutra says, “When you think of the Buddha, that mind is the thirty-two marks and eighty minor characteristics.” Is that not becoming Buddha through thinking of the Buddha? Becoming Buddha is being a Buddha. There is no difference in principle, but the difficulty and ease between seeing one's nature and becoming Buddha is like this. Then is not reciting the Buddha's name more direct and immediate than practicing Chan meditation?

※ One is the words of a patriarch, one is the words of the Buddha. Which one is more important? Which one to embrace, and which to discard? Practitioners should just discard old habits, empty their minds, calm their spirit, and take the time to contemplate and examine it. Then, they will definitely acknowledge that this teaching is not mistaken.

※  When one is correctly reciting, the rewards and retributions of the West are within one’s heart, and that heart is already within the rewards and retributions of the West, like two mirrors reflecting each other, merging and illuminating, This is the aspect of pervading the ten directions horizontally. If we consider the endlessness of time vertically, then the time of recitation is the time of seeing the Buddha, and it is also the time of becoming the Buddha. The time of seeking rebirth is the time of being reborn, and it is also the time of liberating others. The three periods of time exist simultaneously; there is no before or after.

※  This principle is most difficult to understand, but it is most easy to believe. If one can just directly accept it, one will ultimately benefit fully.

※ Generate the vast mind, and cultivate genuine practice. When the mind aligns with the Buddha and with the path, then the mind can transform karma.

※ From here to the West, across ten billion Buddha lands, there is a world called “Utmost Bliss.” In that land is a Buddha named Amitabha, who is now teaching the Dharma. If one simply makes a vow and holds the name, one will achieve rebirth. This is the realm that the Buddha’s heart and eye personally know and see. It cannot be known or seen by the wise and worthy of the three vehicles. Therefore, one should deeply believe in the Buddha’s words, rely on this to make a vow and hold the name, and thus take the Buddha’s knowledge and view as one’s own, and there is no need to seek other entrances to enlightenment.

※ In other Dharma-doors, one must sever afflictions in order to cultivate the path. If even a little of the afflictions of view and thought remains, the birth and death by segments will remain, and one will not be able to leave the Land of Common Residence.

※  Only the cultivation of the Pure Land allows one to traverse the three realms horizontally. One does not need to sever afflictions, and from this Land of Common Residence, one will be reborn in that Land of Common Residence. Once reborn in that land, the roots of birth and death will be severed forever.

※ If one cultivates the Pure Land with an earnest mind, then the Pure Land practice will be strong. When the mind is earnest, the practice is strong, and one's inclination is towards the West. Then at the end of this life, one is sure to go to the West and not anywhere else.

※ The ocean of the Buddhadharma is entered through faith. The Dharma-door of the Pure Land depends on faith as its most essential aspect.

※  Holding the name and reciting the Buddha's name is the profound practice of all Buddhas. Only Bodhisattvas in their last lifetime can understand it in part. All other sages and worthies should just believe and follow it. It cannot be known by their limited wisdom, let alone ordinary beings with lower capacities.

※  Master Zhiyi said, "The mind in meditative concentration at the time of death is the same as the mind of being reborn in the Pure Land.”

※  The *Contemplation Sutra* states: “This mind becomes Buddha, this mind *is* Buddha.” Once these two phrases are mentioned, it implies that a mind not becoming Buddha, a mind is not Buddha; a mind becoming the nine realms, a mind is the nine realms; a mind not becoming the nine realms, a mind is not the nine realms. These implications will all be clear. Alas! If someone understood this principle and still doesn't recite the Buddha’s name, then I don't know what to do.

※  The two phrases from the *Contemplation Sutra*, "This mind becomes Buddha, this mind *is* Buddha," are not only the fundamental principle and essential teaching of this Sutra but also the fundamental principle of all teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha’s lifetime. It is not only the fundamental principle of Shakyamuni Buddha's Dharma-Treasury but also of all the Buddhas’ Dharma-Treasury throughout the ten directions and three times.

※  One who speaks well about the nature of mind will surely not abandon cause and effect. And one who deeply believes in cause and effect will ultimately come to clearly understand the nature of mind.

※ Our present moment of being able to recite, is entirely true and becomes false, and is also entirely false and becomes true. It is subject to conditions all day long, and it is unchanging all day long. The name of the Buddha that is being recited is established through the full merit.  Outside of the merit, there is no name. With the name, one summons the merit.  Outside of the name, there is no merit.  Outside of the ability to recite, there is no Buddha that can be recited.  Outside of the Buddha being recited, there is no mind that can recite.  The ability to do and that which is done are not two, and yet the sentient being and the Buddha are clearly distinct.  It is inherently beyond the four phrases, inherently detached from a hundred negations, inherently pervading everything, and inherently containing everything.  It is absolutely perfect, inconceivable, and harmonious.

※ The nature of one’s present moment of mind is the originally existing true mind.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for directness, clarity, and capturing the original spirit. I've also added some structural elements to enhance readability.

**The Teachings of Master Yin Guang: A Concise Translation**

**I. The Nature of Mind and Practice**

*   The single thought in the present moment can manifest both truth and illusion.  Illusion, in its entirety, is none other than truth. Day after day we accord with conditions, yet day after day remain constant.  Apart from this very thought in the present moment, where else would you find genuine mind and true nature?

*   **For a straightforward, direct, and perfectly complete path, nothing surpasses the single practice of reciting the Buddha's name.**

*   The mind that is capable of reciting is fundamentally a manifestation of truth becoming illusion, and illusion, in its entirety, is truth.  The Buddha who is being recited is fundamentally a complete virtue giving rise to a name, and that name, in its entirety, is virtue.  Outside the mind that is reciting, there is no separate Buddha to be recited.  Outside the Buddha being recited, there is no separate mind capable of reciting.  When the duality of reciter and recited are forgotten, mind and Buddha are one.  In every single thought, the afflictions of the five dwellings are completely subdued and severed; the three defilements are completely transformed and extinguished; the five aggregates are completely broken through; the five turbidities are completely transcended; the four Pure Lands are completely purified; the three bodies are completely contemplated; the myriad practices are completely cultivated; one’s original essence is completely realized, and supreme enlightenment is completely attained.

*   Therefore, with the mind that is wholly Buddha, recite the Buddha who is wholly mind. Indeed, your own fruition of Buddhahood contains a full measure of divine power and majestic virtue, secretly imbuing and blessing you.

*   A single utterance of the Buddha's name, not mixed with extraneous thoughts, allows one to transcend many eons in a single practice of ten recitations. Those who disbelieve this are truly like wood and stone. To abandon this practice and seek other paths is either madness or folly. What else can be said? What else can be said?

*   Severing the views of delusion is like cutting a river flowing for forty miles; how much more so the delusions of thought? If the delusions of view and thought are not completely exhausted, one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death in the realms of existence. This is called "vertically escaping the Three Realms," which is extremely difficult.

*   If with a deep, earnest, and diligent mind you faithfully and willingly uphold the Buddha’s name, this is to use the Buddha's wisdom and insight as your own.  It is, in every single thought, to use the Buddha’s wisdom and insight to cure the wisdom and insight of sentient beings.

*   When a mind filled with faith and aspiration to recite the Buddha's name is continuously maintained, the karmic causes of the realm of birth are transformed into the karmic causes of the realm of Buddhahood. This is an incredibly profound and effective method in the path of spiritual cultivation, akin to turning iron into gold.

*   While reciting the Buddha's name, you should not have any other thoughts. The absence of other thoughts is the practice of *shamatha* (calm abiding). While reciting the Buddha's name, you should be clearly and distinctly aware of what you are doing. This clarity is the practice of *vipassanā* (insight). In a single thought, both *shamatha* and *vipassanā* are complete. There is no separate *shamatha* and *vipassanā*.

**II.  The Incomparable Power of Amitabha Buddha's Name**

*   The enlightenment and awakening attained by Amitabha Buddha are entirely encompassed and completely contained within a single, all-encompassing holy name: *Amitabha Buddha*.

*   A single utterance of *Namo Amitabha Buddha*, if recited well enough, provides more than enough capacity for becoming a Buddha.  Why bother learning any other method?

*   Know that Amitabha Buddha is the embodiment of the Dharma realm. This very name encompasses all Buddhas' names from the ten directions and three times.

*   The practice of reciting the Buddha's name is the *dharani* (comprehensive) practice of Buddhism.

*   The Pure Land path of reciting the Buddha's name takes faith, aspiration, and practice as its core principles; the *bodhi mind* as its foundation; and the principle that "this mind makes a Buddha, this mind *is* a Buddha" as the true meaning of cause encompassing result, and result penetrating cause.  The most essential method of putting it into practice is to gather in the six senses and maintain pure, uninterrupted mindfulness.

*   Seeking rebirth in the Western Pure Land through recitation of the Buddha's name is the most convenient and secure method.

*   A single utterance of the Buddha's name encompasses the entire Tripitaka (Buddhist canon), without exception.

*   Faithfully aspiring to be reborn in the West through reciting the Buddha's name is the single, unsurpassed, and decisive strategy.

*   The practice of reciting the Buddha's name fully encompasses all practices from the whole of Buddhist teachings.

*   In this degenerate age, ordinary people who wish to attain saintly fruition are simply delusional if they do not rely on the Pure Land path.

*   Sentient beings in this degenerate age, with shallow roots and limited capacity, find it extremely difficult to gain genuine benefit from the scriptural teachings and meditation schools.  Only the Pure Land path is reliable refuge.

*   The Buddha's teachings are vast and profound. For ordinary people with limited capacity who wish to end the cycle of birth and death in this very life, there is no other way to fulfil this aspiration except through faith, aspiration, and reciting the Buddha's name to seek rebirth in the West.

*   Reciting the Buddha's name relies on the power of the Buddha to leave the Three Realms and be reborn in the Pure Land.

*   If there is no faith and aspiration, merely reciting the Buddha's name is still relying on one's own power.  Without faith and aspiration, one cannot connect with Amitabha's great vows and experience a responsive communion.

*   The practice of reciting the Buddha's name emphasizes faith and aspiration. With faith and aspiration, even without achieving single-mindedness, one can still be reborn. If one attains single-mindedness but lacks faith and aspiration, one cannot be reborn. The common mistake made by people is placing more emphasis on single-mindedness and neglecting faith and aspiration, missing the essential point.

*   In the practice of reciting the Buddha's name, faith and aspiration are the vanguard. Without genuine faith and earnest aspiration, not only will you not resonate with the practice and be unable to be reborn, even if you do resonate with it, rebirth will not be certain.

*   If ordinary beings lack faith and aspiration to connect with the Buddha, even if they cultivate all other superior practices, including the superior practice of reciting the Buddha's name, they cannot be reborn. Therefore, faith and aspiration are the most crucial aspects.  Master Ou Yi said: "Whether or not one is reborn depends entirely on the presence or absence of faith and aspiration. The degree of one's rebirth is entirely determined by the depth of one’s recitation." This is an ironclad truth that remains unchanged across the appearances of all Buddhas.

*   The most important aspect of reciting the Buddha's name is to end the cycle of birth and death.  If this is the goal, then naturally you will develop disgust for the suffering of birth and death and joyful yearning for the bliss of the West. In this way, faith and aspiration are naturally perfected in every thought.

*   The key point of the practice of reciting the Buddha's name lies in having genuine faith and earnest aspiration. With these qualities, even if one has not achieved single-mindedness, one can still rely on the Buddha’s compassionate power to be reborn with one's karmic burdens.  Without faith and aspiration, even if the mind is without stray thoughts, one will only attain human or heavenly blessings, because they do not resonate with the Buddha. Therefore, one should emphasize faith and aspiration in seeking rebirth in the West.

*   The practice of reciting the Buddha's name emphasizes the three aspects of faith, aspiration, and practice. If one only knows how to recite but does not generate faith and aspiration, even attaining single-mindedness might not be enough for rebirth.  However, with genuine faith and earnest aspiration, even without single-mindedness, one can rely on the Buddha's compassionate power to be reborn.

*   Why is it that many people in the world recite the Buddha's name, yet few are able to end the cycle of birth and death? It is because those who recite the Buddha's name do not have deep faith and earnest aspiration; instead they seek blessings and hope for wealth and status in the next life.

*   Those who cultivate Pure Land practices today generally do not understand the main principle, instead relying solely on ritualistic appearances.  Rebirth of ordinary beings depends entirely on genuine faith and aspiration, and upon the responsive communion between these qualities and Amitabha's great vows, through which one is then received.

*   Amongst Pure Land practitioners, ninety-nine percent lack both the attainment of *dhyana* (meditative concentration) and the purity of the Pure Land.

*   All other practices rely solely on one's own power to end the cycle of birth and death. The practice of reciting the Buddha's name relies on both one's own power and the power of the Buddha.

*   Sentient beings in this degenerate age have deep obscurations and shallow wisdom. Without relying on the Buddha's power, it is extremely difficult to attain liberation.

*   These other practices all rely on one's own power, and are therefore difficult. The Pure Land practice relies entirely on the Buddha's power and is therefore easy.

*   There are countless methods within Buddhism. If one wishes to rely on one’s own power to find the way through meditation, teachings, precepts, or esoteric practices, it is not easy. How much more difficult would it be to use these methods to realize no-birth and end the cycle of birth and death?

*   All other practices rely exclusively on one’s own power. The Pure Land practice relies solely on the Buddha's power. All other practices require the complete purification of all afflictions and karma in order to end the cycle of birth and death. The Pure Land practice allows rebirth with remaining karma, thus immediately joining the ranks of the sages.

*   To end the cycle of birth and death through one’s own power is truly as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

*   Sentient beings in this degenerate age have thin blessings and shallow wisdom, deep obscurations and heavy karma. If they do not cultivate the Pure Land practice, and wish to rely on their own power to cut off delusion and realize truth in order to end the cycle of birth and death, they will find it incredibly difficult, immeasurably difficult.

*   Zen relies solely on one’s own power.  Pure Land practice combines both one’s own power and the Buddha's power. Comparing these two, the Pure Land path is most suitable.

*   The Pure Land path surpasses all other practices because it relies on the Buddha's power. All other paths rely on one’s own power. How can one's own power be compared to the Buddha's power?  This is the most crucial point in understanding why one should cultivate the Pure Land path.

*   Know that even Bodhisattvas who have not yet attained Buddhahood need to rely on the Buddha’s power.  How much more so ordinary beings burdened by karma! To boast of one's own power and not rely on the Buddha's power is to speak loftily while acting poorly. The difference between the Buddha's power and one’s own power is as vast as the difference between heaven and earth. May all beings understand this.

*   In general, do not study Zen texts. Zen’s meaning lies beyond words; if you interpret the words directly, you will misunderstand the Buddha’s teachings and create bad outcomes from good intentions.

*   The method of Chan (Zen) meditation is not suitable for people of this present time.  Even if you try, you will only attain intellectual knowledge and never directly understand your own mind and see your own nature. Why? First, you lack a qualified teacher to guide and clarify your understanding; second, students do not know the true purpose of Chan and misunderstand what it means to "investigate Zen."

*   In general, do not concern yourself with the language of the Zen school, for their meaning is beyond words and not for you to understand. Furthermore, you need to personally investigate in order to awaken. Not only is it unlikely you will awaken, even if you do, it is difficult to end the cycle of birth and death because you rely on your own power. To speak ignorantly about Zen creates great offense, since it is a false discussion of prajna, with the power to confuse and mislead sentient beings. Beware! Beware!

*   The goal of the Zen school is awakening; the goal of the Pure Land school is rebirth. Of those who awaken but are not reborn, ninety out of one hundred do not attain liberation. However, amongst those who are reborn, none fail to awaken.

*   Outsiders often seek awakening, chasing after different kinds of experiences, neglecting the primary goal of certain rebirth.  This is to abandon the root and pursue the branches.

*   Practitioners of the Buddha-name recitation should not get involved with the method of Chan meditation and investigation, as those practitioners do not focus on faith, aspiration, and seeking rebirth.

*   Zen meditation focuses on investigating one's own mind; reciting the Buddha's name additionally relies on the Buddha's power.

*   Seeing one's nature and understanding one's mind is just awakening, it is not yet realization and is not liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

*   For the current times, it is advisable to set aside Zen texts and focus solely on cultivating Pure Land practices.

*   If one wants the clearest explanation about self-power vs. other-power and the ease vs. difficulty of Zen and Pure Land, nothing surpasses the "Four Discernments" of Master Yongming Yanshou.

*   While reciting the Buddha’s name, each word and each phrase should originate from the heart, be spoken from the mouth, and enter through the ears.  As it is for one phrase, so it is for a hundred or a thousand, or a hundred million. When one does this, stray thoughts will have nowhere to arise, and one’s mind will naturally harmonize with the Buddha. Gather in all six senses and maintain continuous pure mindfulness. If one follows this practice, there will be no deviation or error.

*   While reciting, one should gather their hearing and listen carefully. Whether one recites aloud or silently, the recitation should originate in the heart, the sound come from the mouth, and the sound enter the ears.  Both the heart and the mouth should recite clearly and distinctly, and the ears should hear clearly and distinctly. By focusing the mind in this way, stray thoughts will naturally cease.

*   The “ten-recitation counting method” means that when reciting the Buddha's name, from the first to the tenth phrase, one must recite clearly and remember clearly.  Having finished ten phrases, one should again begin from the first to the tenth, rather than going to twenty or thirty.  Recite and remember each phrase.  Do not count on prayer beads; only count with your mind. If counting to ten is difficult, divide it into two breaths: from one to five, then from six to ten. If this is still difficult, do three breaths: from one to three, from four to six, and from seven to ten. Recite clearly, remember clearly, and listen clearly. When stray thoughts have no foothold, single-mindedness will naturally be attained over time.

*   The most effective method for diligently reciting the Buddha's name is to gather in all six senses and maintain continuous pure mindfulness.

*   One should recite the Buddha's name continuously from morning to night.  The aspiration to be reborn should constantly remain in one’s heart. This is a constant dedication of merit.

*   Aspiration includes aspiring to quickly leave this suffering world and quickly be reborn in that blissful world.

*   When the mind, the mouth, and the ears are all clear, it means that all six senses are gathered in.  (The mind is the *manas* (mental) sense; the mouth is the tongue sense).  When the mind recites and the mouth speaks, the eyes will no longer seek outwards, and the body will no longer be arrogant or unrestrained.

*   The practice of listening is truly the essence of Buddha-name recitation. It is beneficial to all, and free from harm, with profound merit.

*   To begin, gather in all six senses through listening.

*   Reciting the Buddha's name while simultaneously listening intently is the most reliable approach. It benefits all people regardless of their aptitude and causes no harm.

*   When reciting the Buddha's name, by gathering in the hearing and listening carefully, the six senses are also gathered in.

*   Apply the methods used by Avalokitesvara (Guanyin) to reverse one's hearing and listen to the nature of self, and practice the Pure Land methods used by Mahasthamaprapta (Shizhi) to gather all six senses and maintain continuous pure mindfulness.

*   "Truly resolve the cycle of birth and death, generate the *bodhi mind*, and with deep faith and aspiration, uphold the Buddha's name." These sixteen words are the key points of the Buddha-name recitation method.

**III.  The Causes and Cures of Calamities and Disease**

*   The calamities of the current world, and all the disasters we experience, are caused by past bad karma that we created.

*   Amongst all evil actions, killing is the most grave.

*   Due to the karmic knots of killing, calamities of war occur, as well as disasters such as floods, fires, droughts, famines, diseases, winds, earthquakes, tsunamis, and river floods, all follow in succession.

*   All kinds of calamities and diseases are ultimately caused by deep karma from the past combined with the lack of caution in our current actions.

*   The karmic knot of killing is most intense in the practice of eating meat.

*   Looking back on history, there have been fewer times of peace and more times of chaos. Even when there is great peace, it only lasts for a hundred or so years. What is the reason for this? It is due to the accumulated karmic effects of killing and eating meat in past lives, combined with selfish, self-serving minds in this life.

*   The disasters of war, bandits, and disease are mostly caused by killing and eating meat.

*   Due to killing, great disharmony is created with nature; the resulting discordant *qi* (energy) manifests as disasters like droughts, floods, and pestilence. The karmic knot of killing causes the human calamity of war. When we explore the root of these disasters, it is all due to killing and eating meat in past lives and in the current life.

*   The calamity of eating meat is extremely harsh and severe, not only harming this present life but also impacting many eons to come.

*   Know that the great calamity of war is caused by the karma of killing in past lives.

*   Dangerous illnesses are mostly caused by the karma of killing in past lives and in the current life.

*   Even though a meat-eater does not personally kill, they are still not free of the karma of killing, for there would be no meat without killing, and they pay others to kill on their behalf.

*   In one lifetime, people unknowingly eat countless lives.

*   Killing all manner of beings to satisfy one's taste buds – are they not sentient creatures? Don’t they feel pain, want to live, and not want to be killed and eaten?  If you kill and eat them, they will certainly kill and eat you in the future.

*   Why needlessly spend money to buy misfortune (for eating meat incurs a karmic debt of killing and therefore is a cause for trouble)?

*   Eating meat is harmful to health. A vegetarian diet is beneficial to health.

*   All beings possess Buddha-nature; they were all our parents in the past, and will all become Buddhas in the future.  We should try our best to help and protect them, how can we kill them to satisfy our taste buds?

*   Eating meat daily is equivalent to killing daily, for without killing, there would be no meat.

*   The practice of eating meat or being vegetarian is a crucial factor in our personal rise and fall, and the peace and chaos of the world.

*   If you want to live a long, peaceful, and happy life free from unexpected calamities, the most effective way to reverse disasters and calamities is by practicing abstaining from killing and becoming vegetarian.

*   Those who wish to cultivate Pure Land practices must follow the proper ethics, fulfill their responsibilities, stay away from evil, and maintain sincerity. They must refrain from all evil, practice all good, abstain from killing and eating meat, protect all forms of life, faithfully aspire to be reborn in the West, and recite the Buddha’s name.

*   All great sages and virtuous people without exception regard refraining from killing and releasing beings as the fundamental practice for averting calamities of war, cultivating merit, calming violence, and living long and happy lives.

*   Those who refrain from killing and releasing beings rarely experience disasters such as plagues, floods, and unexpected catastrophes.  Therefore, it is clear that protecting life is essentially protecting oneself.  Refraining from killing prevents one from being killed by heavenly forces, ghosts, and bandits, or in future lifetimes due to karmic retribution.

*   If one wishes to eliminate the karma of killing from past and present lifetimes, they must refrain from killing and become vegetarian. In addition, if they sincerely recite the Buddha’s name and Avalokitesvara (Guanyin)'s name, they can quickly recover from illnesses. This will also cultivate virtue and plant good roots.

*   When afflicted by karmic illnesses that doctors cannot cure, sincerely reciting the Buddha’s name or Avalokitesvara’s name will bring quick recovery. This is because the vengeful ghosts will receive the benefits of Buddha-name recitation and go on to a better path.

*   When facing extreme emergencies, reciting the holy name of Avalokitesvara is the most effortless and most responsive method.

*   Having taken refuge in the Three Jewels, one must abstain from killing, protect living beings, and eat a pure vegetarian diet.  Even if one cannot adopt a pure vegetarian diet right away, one should observe the ten precepts or six precepts of fasting. One must deeply understand the harm of eating meat, and even on days that one is not vegetarian, one must try to minimize meat consumption and wholeheartedly recite the Buddha’s name.

*   The minds and morals of people in this present world have deteriorated to their limits. Calamities and disasters frequently strike. The arrival of misfortune cannot be predicted, cannot be avoided, and cannot be defended against. If one can follow the teachings of the Master Yin Guang's collected writings, and sincerely recite the names of the Buddha and Avalokitesvara, one will surely receive secret protection and guidance. One will experience a transformation, from difficulty to no difficulty, or from severity to mildness, and will definitely not suffer the same fate as those who do not recite the Buddha's name.

*   The merit of reciting the Buddha's name not only brings rebirth in the West, but can also eliminate unusual and unexpected calamities. Even chronic illnesses that doctors cannot cure will be completely healed through sincere recitation of the Buddha’s name over time.

*   People in the world have become accustomed to eating meat. You should know that all meat has poison, which is due to the hate and resentment in the hearts of those who kill the animals. Even if it does not cause immediate death, accumulating these toxins over time will cause sores and illnesses. Therefore, anyone who values their health should abstain from eating meat forever.

*   The practice of eating meat is extremely strange; it has become so customary that we have become ignorant of its wrongness.

*   To kill animals as a sacrifice to heaven and earth is to act against the benevolent virtues of heaven and earth that cherish life.

*   Do not create the karma of killing, for having created the karma of killing, one will surely experience retribution in the form of being killed.

*   For those who have chronic conditions that cannot be cured by Western or Eastern medicine, encourage them to refrain from killing, protect life, become vegetarian, recite the Buddha's name and Avalokitesvara's name. If they are genuinely sincere, they can immediately transform their situation and quickly heal.

*   If one can act with utmost sincerity and respect, generating the great *bodhi mind* of benefiting oneself and benefiting others, and recite *Namo Amitabha Buddha* and *Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva*, they can liberate the karmic debts from past lives. If the liberated beings are relieved of their suffering, the one reciting can experience the karma of their illnesses being dispelled.

*   One should focus on proper ethics and fulfilling one's duties. One should stay away from evil, maintain sincerity, refrain from all evil, practice all good, abstain from killing and protecting life, be vegetarian, recite the Buddha's name, aspire to be reborn in the West, and forever escape the cycle of suffering. One should also earnestly explain these principles to others.

*   The act of releasing beings and the act of killing beings are always witnessed by heaven, earth, and the spirits. They will definitely bestow blessings or calamities accordingly. Therefore, do not take the lives of the weak.

*   If you want your family to be peaceful and prosperous, to have good health and peace of mind, to have world peace and the wellbeing of all people, then seek them through refraining from killing, releasing beings, becoming vegetarian, and reciting the Buddha's name.  If you seek it, you will certainly obtain it.

*   I have always advocated refraining from killing and releasing beings, and explaining the principles of karmic retribution, hoping to reverse the calamities and disasters that we are now experiencing.

*   When treating illnesses, especially difficult-to-cure karmic illnesses, encourage patients to recite the holy name of Avalokitesvara, as well as refraining from killing and eating meat and protecting life.

*   Those who recite the Buddha’s name should observe a permanent vegetarian diet. If one cannot, one should at least observe the six or ten precepts of fasting, gradually reducing meat consumption until one can completely abstain, for this is the most sensible approach.

*   Moreover, this is an age of great suffering and turmoil, when the arrival of disaster is inevitable. If we can constantly recite the names of the Buddha and Avalokitesvara, we will certainly receive the protection of the Buddha’s compassion and transform misfortune into good fortune. Even if there is no disaster, our karma will be purified, our wisdom will be brightened, our obstacles will be removed, and our blessings will increase.

*   Those who benefit others and all living beings will thrive; those who harm others and living beings will perish.

*   Understand that benefiting others and all beings is true self-benefit. Harm to others and to all beings is worse than harming yourself. Doing good will definitely yield good results; doing evil will definitely yield evil results.

*   It is important to promote refraining from killing and becoming vegetarian as the root solution to our problems.

*   Vegetarian food is healthy; eating meat harms life. The hate-filled energy in the moment of killing is extremely potent. Do not crave meat; if you eat it you will need to repay the debt. When the time comes to repay, it will be truly pitiful.

*   All animals have sentience. They are afraid of death and treasure life. If you casually kill, or kill them to eat, you will definitely experience karmic retribution in this life or future lives.

*   In these times, the state of the world is like lying down on a pile of firewood while a fire is quickly rising underneath it. And yet we still pass our days casually, not seeking salvation in a single utterance of the Buddha’s name. How shallow is their perception!

*   If we investigate the causes of calamities, we find that they are mostly caused by killing. To stop killing, we must begin by refraining from killing, becoming vegetarian, protecting life, and buying lives to release them.

*   Thus, we see that refraining from killing and releasing beings is the most beneficial method to stop disasters at their roots.

*   Know that the act of releasing beings is a profound and good action that inspires everyone to protect all forms of life.

*   Releasing beings serves to awaken the inherent kindness in all people, so that they abstain from killing and become vegetarians, allowing all sentient beings to fulfill their natural lifespan. It will bring an end to the causes of killing, eliminate the consequences of killing, nurture our inner compassion, and reduce the overall calamity of killing in the world. Therefore, do not think of this as an unimportant matter and treat it with indifference.

*   Those who insist that releasing beings must be done perfectly before they are willing to do it will cause everyone to spend their entire lives without releasing beings. In the future, they will certainly find themselves in a situation where no one will be able to save them from death. How sad, how sorrowful.

*   The act of refraining from killing and releasing beings is simple and easily seen. However, the *principles* of refraining from killing and releasing beings are deep and difficult to understand. Without understanding these principles, even if one does the actions, one's mind will not be genuinely sincere and compassionate. The merit and benefits will be limited by the scale of one’s mind.  If they encounter criticism from those who do not understand, they might be easily swayed and their initial good intention may vanish.

*   Since Buddhism came to the East, it has explained the principles of cause and effect, encouraging people to refrain from killing and release beings, and give up eating meat.

*   If people wish for family reunions, long lives, good health, peace of mind, and all circumstances to go as wished, then one should generate great compassion and practice the releasing of beings. Thus, heaven, earth, and the spirits will acknowledge one’s sincerity in loving all living beings and the things one has wished for will be granted.

*   All compassionate people today advocate refraining from killing and releasing beings, becoming vegetarian, and reciting the Buddha's name. They explain the principles of the cycle of birth and death and karmic retribution, in the hopes that all people in the world may enjoy peace and attain liberation.

*   The purpose of releasing beings is to inspire everyone to refrain from killing and protect life, while also acting out one’s own compassion. There are many people in this world, and their minds and actions differ greatly. Even if we are unable to inspire everyone, by inspiring even one person, that one person will reduce killing over their lifetime. How much more so if there are more than one?

*   When releasing beings, it is important to act quickly in the summer. If you are too focused on making it perfect with specific rituals and methods, it may take a long time and harm the beings.

*   I am fortunate to have been born into human form due to the merit I have accumulated in the past. Therefore, I should resolve my grudges, refrain from killing and release beings, allowing all forms of life to live out their lives. In addition, I will recite the Buddha's name and dedicate this merit towards the Pure Land, allowing these beings to be liberated. Even if their karma is heavy and they cannot be reborn now, I will use the merit of my compassionate actions to attain rebirth in the West at the end of my life.

*   The Buddha, with great compassion, allows all beings to go about their lives according to their nature.

*   Those with limited wisdom who do not understand the greater principles use their foolish views to obstruct others from refraining from killing and releasing beings. In the future, when they become animals, they will not be able to encounter anyone who will release and save their lives. The suffering at that time will be due to the wrong views they cultivated in this lifetime.

*   It is not difficult to be vegetarian, but if you are greedy for flavor then it becomes difficult. The “three pure meats” and “vegetarian with meat flavoring” were created for those who have lower faculties.

*   The Buddha's intention in establishing the practice of eating vegetarian during fast days was to permanently end the karma of killing and to provide a means to gradually reduce meat consumption.

*   Eggs are also not suitable to eat, because they contain the potential for life and are also toxic.

*   Eggs should not be eaten. Some heretics say that eggs without a male are edible. Do not listen to them.

*   When buying and releasing beings, it is similar to giving alms. One should be wise in this, not choosing a specific time, place, or type of animal. Purchase and release beings spontaneously, allowing them to gain genuine benefit. If one specifies a time, place, or type of animal, then they will be encouraging people to capture more.

**IV.  Sincerity and Respect**

*   Sincerity and respect are truly the most profound secrets for transcending the ordinary, attaining sainthood, ending the cycle of birth and death.

*   If you wish to gain true benefit from the Buddha’s teachings, then seek it in respect. With even a small amount of respect, one will eliminate a fraction of their karmic offenses and add to their merit and wisdom.

*   There is a secret I must earnestly reveal: utmost sincerity and respect – wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, striving for accuracy, clarity, and a tone suitable for a general English-speaking audience interested in Buddhist thought. I've also added some notes where context or nuance might be helpful.

**Translation:**

**Core Principles:**

*   **"Sincerity and Respect":** These words are universally known, but the *path* they represent is universally misunderstood. 
    
    *(Note: This refers to the idea that everyone knows the importance of being sincere and respectful, but few truly embody these qualities in their actions and spiritual practice.)*

**Regarding Scriptures:**

*   **Writing Sutras:** Writing sutras should be done with the same care and attention to detail as a scholar drafting an examination essay. Not a single stroke should be careless, and the script must follow the formal style. Writing scriptures is intended to transform ordinary, mundane consciousness into the wisdom of the Tathagata (Buddha). Compared to a newly-graduated scholar entering the imperial examination, one should be even more diligent and respectful, without the slightest negligence. If one can maintain such a mindset, then one’s habitual consciousness can be transformed into the treasury of the Tathagata.
    
    *(Note: This emphasizes the reverence and focus required when dealing with sacred texts.)*
*   **Treating Scriptures:** When reciting scriptures, you must clear your mind of worries and attachments, focusing with a pure heart, as if standing before the holy presence, personally listening to the perfect teaching. One should not allow a single thought of laziness or negligence to arise. With persistent effort, one can gradually awaken to Buddha wisdom and naturally resonate with the profound truths of the Way. If sincerity reaches its peak, one will experience a sudden and complete breakthrough. This is the most effective method for reading scriptures and reciting the Buddha's name.

*   **Scriptures as Teachers:** Sutras are the teachers of all Buddhas throughout the three periods of time (past, present, and future) and are the relics of the Tathagata’s Dharma body. They should be treated as if they are the true Buddha and not merely paper and ink.
  
  *(Note: “Relics of the Tathagata’s Dharma body” refers to the idea that the teachings are the living essence of the Buddha.)*

**Repentance and Reform:**

*   **Repentance in Pure Land Practice:** Openly expressing repentance is most easily aligned with the Pure Land Dharma Gate. It is said, "If the mind is pure, the Buddha Land is pure." However, once one recognizes wrongdoing and genuinely expresses repentance, one must then correct those wrongs and move towards virtue. If there is no reform, then the repentance is just empty talk with no real benefit.
  
  *(Note: This highlights the importance of action following repentance.)*

**The Image of the Buddha:**

*   **Buddha Image:** Buddha images should be seen as if they were the true Buddha, not as mere clay, wood, bronze, or iron.
  
   *(Note: This emphasizes the spiritual significance of Buddha images as focal points for practice.)*

**Cause and Effect (Karma):**

*   **Cause and Effect as a Universal Law:** Cause and effect is the method that addresses both the root and the symptoms of our problems. From the first arising of aspiration in ordinary people to the attainment of enlightenment by the Tathagata, all actions fall within the scope of cause and effect.

*   **Using Karma to Transform Society:** In this present age, if the law of cause and effect is not used as the primary method to save the nation and its people, then any actions will not have a significant effect.
  
    *(Note: This highlights the societal implications of understanding and applying karma.)*
*   **The Depth of Karmic Teachings:** The Tathagata's teachings on the law of cause and effect, the cycle of six realms of rebirth, etc., can be understood at both a profound and a more superficial level. Through these teachings, we can cultivate our minds, cut through delusion, realize truth, and liberate ourselves from the cycle of birth and death. When applied to the world, these teachings can eliminate violence and return society to its original purity.
  
  *(Note: This emphasizes the dual purpose of karma teachings: personal and societal.)*

*   **The Importance of Cause and Effect in Today's World:** If the concept of cause and effect and the cycle of birth and death are not used as moral guidance in today’s world, even if all the sages appeared, they would be unable to do anything.

*  **Moral Decline:** The reason why the world's morals are declining and people are sinking into depravity is because of their failure to understand the principles of karmic cause and effect.

*  **A Foundation for Society:** Cause and effect is truly the great safeguard for maintaining human morality. It is capable of compensating for the inadequacies of government regulations. It is the great power of both worldly and other-worldly sages for governing the world and liberating beings. It is the key to the rise and fall of nations, past and present.

*   **Recommended Texts:** Among books that explain the principle of cause and effect, there are none better than *The Treatise on Action and Response* and the *Yin Zhi Wen*. Frequently explaining and discussing these two books will bring enormous benefits.

*   **Cause and Effect as the Entryway:** Cause and effect is the first gateway into the path.

*   **Promoting Karma:** Those who practice Pure Land should promote the understanding of cause and effect.

*   **Education of Children:**  Teaching children from a young age about the three lifetimes of cause and effect is truly the way to pacify the world and rectify the root of problems.

*   **Lack of Virtue:** The world lacks good people because of the lack of proper education in families, and within family education, the mother’s teaching is the most important.

*   **Women as Teachers:** The duty of women is to support their husbands and educate their children. If there are no virtuous women, how can there be virtuous wives and mothers?
 
*   **Early Childhood Education:** From the time children begin to understand, teach them the principles of filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as well as the concepts of karmic cause and effect and the six realms of rebirth.

*   **Early Education:** An ancient saying states: “Teach a wife when she first arrives; teach a child in infancy.” Because habits become character, we should be careful from the start. The order and disorder of the world all stem from this, so do not regard the old monk's rambling as irrelevant or unimportant.

*   **Effective Teaching Tools:** The best way to promote the concept of karmic retribution is to teach people to uphold *The Treatise on Action and Response* and the *Yin Zhi Wen*. These texts categorize good and evil, making them easy to understand and beneficial.

*  **Mirror of Conduct:** *The Treatise on Action and Response*, the *Yin Zhi Wen*, and the *Awakening the World Scripture* serve as invaluable guides for self-discipline and the restoration of proper conduct.

*   **The Most Excellent Book:** *An Shi Quan Shu* is the crown jewel of all virtuous books, past and present.

*  **The Root of Peace:** The good education of children is the foundation for peace and stability, and the education of girls is particularly important.

*   **The Power of Women:** Women wield a large share of the power to govern and bring peace to the world.
 
*   **The Importance of Virtuous Women:** The world lacks virtuous people because it lacks virtuous women. With virtuous women, there will be virtuous wives and mothers. And with virtuous wives and mothers, their husbands and children will rarely be bad.

*   **Cultivating Virtue:** If people have a virtuous mother when young and a virtuous wife when they grow up, it will be impossible for them not to become virtuous people. This is a sound strategy to rectify problems and bring peace.

*   **Addressing the Root Causes:** If we want to reverse the decline of morality and public sentiment, we must tackle the root causes of the problem, which is the most effective way to achieve great results with little effort.

*   **Fundamental Steps:** By focusing on the root causes, we are promoting family education and emphasizing karmic cause and effect.

*  **Family Education:** Family education is the foundation for governing the state and bringing peace to the world. And the principle of karmic cause and effect is an essential method to assist education.

*   **Mother’s Teaching:** Mother's education in the family is the key to producing talented individuals and achieving peace throughout the world.

*   **The Source of Wisdom:** Ancient sages were all products of their virtuous parents’ good teachings.

*  **Early Teachings on Cause and Effect:** When teaching children, it is important to start when they are young. First, they must learn about the principle of cause and effect. Then, they will naturally fear wrong and immoral behaviors, and will not engage in them.

*  **Rescuing the World:** The only way to save the world is to emphasize family education, hoping that everyone will explain the principle of cause and effect to their children, thereby establishing a solid foundation.

**Pure Land Practice:**

*   **Practice:** If you wish to practice the Pure Land Path, you must honor ethical relationships, fulfill your duties, eliminate evil, maintain sincerity, avoid all wrong actions, do all good actions, abstain from killing, be vegetarian, protect all life, have faith, make vows, recite the Buddha's name, and seek rebirth in the Western Pure Land.

*   **Practice and Ethics:** Those who recite the Buddha's name must be filial to parents, respect elders, be compassionate and refrain from killing, cultivate the ten virtuous actions, and also be kind parents, filial children, loving older siblings, respectful younger siblings, harmonious husbands and wives, benevolent masters, and loyal servants. Always fulfill your own duties and do not consider whether others are fulfilling their duties towards you.

*   **The Path of the Sage:** Being filial to one's mother-in-law, respecting one's husband, teaching one's children, being kind to servants, raising and educating children from previous marriages – this is the path of sages in the world and also the way to strengthen the foundation of Buddhist practice.

*   **Fulfilling Duties:** We should fulfill our duties, so that Heaven and the Buddhas can bear witness.

*   **The Core Teachings of Buddhism:** Understand that Buddha's teachings encourage us to honor ethical relationships, fulfill our responsibilities, avoid all wrong actions, do all good actions, abstain from killing, protect all life, be vegetarian, and recite the Buddha's name.

*   **Focus on Practice:** You should focus on honoring ethical relationships and fulfilling your duties as well as having faith, making vows and reciting the Buddha's name.

*   **Ethical Living:** Reciting the Buddha’s name, one must fulfill one’s duties, abide by the world’s ethics. This includes upholding moral duties, eliminating evil thoughts, cultivating sincerity, avoiding all evil deeds, performing all good actions.

*   **Practitioner's Duties:** Those who study Buddhism must be kind parents, filial children, loving older siblings, respectful younger siblings. They must first establish themselves and then help others do the same. They must practice self-benefit and benefit others. They should fulfill their individual duties, serve as an example, and cultivate the six paramitas extensively.

*   **The Endorsement of Buddhas:**  In today's world, even if ancient Buddhas who have already attained enlightenment appeared, they would not promote anything outside of upholding moral duties, fulfilling responsibilities, and emphasizing the Pure Land Dharma Gate. If even Master Bodhidharma were to appear now, he would be advocating for relying on the power of the Buddha’s Dharma.

*   **The Path to Liberation:** To uphold moral duties, fulfill responsibilities, eliminate evil, maintain sincerity, avoid all wrong actions, do all good actions, abstain from killing, protect all life, be vegetarian, recite the Buddha's name, aspire to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, leave the cycle of suffering forever, and earnestly explain this path to others.

*   **Filial Piety as the Foundation:** Buddhism considers filial piety as the root. Therefore, the *Brahma Net Sutra* says: "Filial piety is called precept, it is also called restraint."

*   **The Importance of Filial Piety:** If you are not filial to your parents and do not teach your children, you are a criminal in the Buddhist teachings. It is impossible to receive the blessings and guidance of the Buddhas.

*   **The True Cause for Pure Land Rebirth:**  The *Contemplation Sutra* considers filial piety, honoring one's teachers, having a compassionate heart and not killing, cultivating the ten virtuous actions, taking refuge in the Triple Gem, upholding the precepts, observing proper conduct, generating bodhicitta (the intention to seek enlightenment for the benefit of all beings), firmly believing in cause and effect, reciting the Mahayana teachings, and encouraging others to advance as the true causes for achieving Pure Land rebirth. Even if one has only one of these eleven qualities, with deep faith and vows, and the aspiration to be reborn, they can all achieve their wish.

**Maternal Care:**

*   **Pregnancy:** Pregnant women should avoid anger, as it can lead to miscarriage.

*   **Nursing:** When nursing, mothers must have a peaceful mind. If angry, the milk will become toxic. In severe cases, it will cause immediate death, and in mild cases, it will cause death within half or a full day; there will be no cases of the child surviving.  Even mild anger, though it will not cause death, can still cause illness.
    
*   **Dealing with Anger:** If a mother becomes angry, she absolutely must not feed her child immediately. She must calm her heart and mind first, and only feed after half a day. Before feeding, she should express a small amount of milk into a cup, throw it away, wipe the nipple clean, and then feed; this will prevent harm.

*   **Emotional State:** If the mother's heart is still burning with anger, she should not feed the child, even after a full day. If she does, even if the child doesn’t die, they will fall seriously ill.

*   **Tragedy of Toxic Milk:** Throughout history, countless children have been killed by toxic milk. How tragic!
     
**Master Yin Guang's Teachings (Part 4):**

*   **The Importance of Death Awareness:**  For those who pursue the Way (spiritual path), never forget the word "death," and your spiritual progress will naturally be accomplished.

*   **Death is Inevitable:** There is nothing more tragic in this world than death, and no one can escape it.

*   **Death is a Transition:** In reality, the word “death” is just a name. When our past life’s karmic reward comes to an end, we leave this body and receive another.

*   **The Eternal True Nature:** You must know that your own true nature does not die. What we call death is only the discarding of this body, and the taking of another.

*   **The Cycle of Rebirth:** If we do not recite the Buddha's name, we will again follow the force of our good and bad karma to be reborn in different realms of existence. However, if, as you approach death, you single-mindedly recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha", your sincere recitation will surely evoke the Buddha’s great compassion and guidance for rebirth into the Pure Land.

*   **Fear of Death is an Obstacle:** You must not fear death. Fearing death prevents us from escaping death and will hinder our chances of rebirth in the West because it is counter to the Buddha’s teachings. Although the Buddha has great compassion, he is helpless to assist those who do not follow his teachings.

*   **Rejoice in Death:** Leaving this suffering world and being reborn in the joyous world of the Pure Land is the most blissful thing. One should have a joyful heart.

*   **Focus on the Pure Land:** Strongly encourage the sick to let go of everything and single-mindedly recite the Buddha’s name. If there are matters to attend to, they should be resolved promptly. After that, they should be put aside. It should be taken that one is about to follow the Buddha to be reborn in the Buddha’s kingdom. All the riches, joys, family and the various worldly attachments become hindrances. They should not give rise to any attachment in their mind.

*   **Helping the Dying:** When parents, siblings, or other family members are seriously ill and recovery is unlikely, you should have filial and compassionate hearts and encourage them to recite the Buddha’s name and seek rebirth in the West. Support them by reciting with them. When the sick person passes away, they will be reborn in the Pure Land. The benefits are beyond measure.

*   **The Three Essentials for Rebirth:** Here are three essentials to help a dying person achieve rebirth:
    *   First: Skillfully guide and comfort them, helping them to generate true faith.
    *   Second: Organize a continuous rotation of people to recite the Buddha’s name, assisting in pure mindfulness.
    *   Third: Strictly avoid moving them or crying, to prevent any problems.

*   **Critical Time:** When a patient is about to die, it is the critical moment where the distinction between ordinary and saintly, human and ghost, is made. It is an extremely crucial time. Only the Buddha’s name can be used to guide their consciousness. Absolutely do not bathe them, change their clothes, or move their bed. Let them sit or lie as they wish. Do not move them at all. Also, do not express sorrow or cry in front of them.

*   **Assisted Recitation:** When a patient is about to stop breathing, three groups should continuously recite the Buddha's name until they have stopped breathing. Then the groups should rotate for another three hours, and according to other teachings, it is best to continue for eight to twenty-four hours. After that, you can rest and make necessary arrangements.

*   **Contemplating Death:** Keep the word “death” on your forehead and eyebrows.
  
*   **Attaining Focus Through Death Awareness:** If the mind is not unified during recitation, it is because the mind is not deeply aware of the reality of death. If you imagine being swept away by water or fire with no chance of rescue, and if you imagine that you are about to die and fall into hell, then the mind will naturally become unified. There is no need to seek other amazing methods.

*   **Think of Hell:** Think about the suffering of hell, and then generate Bodhicitta. This is the crucial teaching of the Greatly Awakened One.

*   **Mindful Recitation:** When reciting the Buddha’s name, always imagine that you are dying and falling into hell. Then your recitation will naturally become earnest, and naturally be in accord with your practice.

*  **The First Path:** Using the fear of suffering to recite the Buddha’s name is the first and most effective method to overcome suffering, and also the best way to dissolve karma.

*   **Placing Death at the Forefront:** Truly, you must put the word "death" (this word is extremely good) upon your forehead.

*  **Treating Illness:** If a person who recites the Buddha’s name falls ill, they should focus on waiting for death. If they have not yet reached the end of their life, they can then quickly recover by completely letting go of all attachments and reciting the Buddha’s name. This is the best way to dissolve karma. If you cannot let go and still seek a cure, then you will definitely not achieve rebirth, as you do not truly desire it. If you do not understand these principles, how can you rely on the Buddha’s compassionate power?

*  **The Best Way to Benefit the Deceased:** The best way to benefit the deceased is to recite the Buddha’s name. Rituals of offering food are only for show.

*   **Prohibit Alcohol and Meat:** You must not consume alcohol or meat during funeral rites.

*   **Focus on Recitation:** After death, one should only recite the Buddha’s name. Do not perform water-land rituals, recite sutras, or perform repentance rituals. These are mere formalities that have little real benefit.

*   **Death Awareness:** Keep the word "death" on your mind.

*   **Fear of Death:** Why fear death? If you have fear of death in your mind, you will continue suffering in the cycle of birth and death, with no chance of escaping.

*   **Contemplating Death While Practicing:** When reciting the Buddha’s name, imagine that you have already died and not yet been reborn. At each and every moment, put all the worldly attachments aside. Besides the Buddha’s name, there should be no other thoughts.

*   **Detachment Through Death:** Take it that "I am dead." All delusions are no longer useful. If you can recite like this, you will gain great benefits.

*   **The Pure Land as Home:** Rebirth in the Pure Land is like leaving a pit of feces and a prison and arriving at a pure, joyful, and comfortable hometown.

*   **Abandon Fear:** You must not have the foolish delusion of fearing death. If you have a fear of death in your mind, you will not achieve rebirth.

*   **Urgency:** You have lived seventy years and have few days left. Like a prisoner on the way to execution, you are taking each step closer to death. Refrain from everything else, and focus on the Pure Land path. If you see my sincere practice, then we are true fellow practitioners.

**Master Hong Yi's Teachings:**

*   **The Simplicity of the Pure Land Path:** Reciting the Buddha’s name is the most practical, simple, and vital path in Buddhism. However, because of its simplicity and lack of profound, mysterious doctrines, intellectuals often doubt it. For this path, intuition is more important than understanding. First, do not ask, “Where is the Pure Land?” First, affirm whether you can humbly accept this teaching. Only when you enter this path will you feel that this world is not simple but profound and magnificent.

*   **Questions on Long Life and Health:** First, I ask you: 1. Do you want to live longer? 2. Do you want to be healed of illness? 3. Do you want to avoid disasters? 4. Do you want children? 5. Do you want to achieve rebirth? If you do, then I have a most simple method to share with you: Release life.

*   **Release Life:** I hope that from today onward, you will diligently practice releasing life and thoroughly reform your practice of taking life.

*   **Letting Go in Sickness:** When severely ill, you should let go of all family matters and your own physical concerns. Concentrate on reciting the Buddha’s name with all your heart, and aspire to be reborn in the West. If you do this, and if your lifespan is complete, you will surely achieve rebirth. If your lifespan is not complete, and you seek to be reborn, then you can quickly recover because your sincere mind will eliminate past karma.

*   **Seeking Only Cure:** If you do not let go of everything and focus solely on reciting the Buddha’s name, then if your lifespan is complete, you will definitely not achieve rebirth because you are focused on seeking a cure instead of seeking rebirth. If your lifespan is not complete, you will only increase your suffering from your hopes for a cure and from fear and worry.

*   **The Supreme Physician:** Amitabha Buddha is the supreme physician. If you do not seek help from him, you are foolish and crazy.

*   **The Universal Medicine:** "Amitabha Buddha" is the panacea. If you do not take it, then you are completely wrong.
    
*   **Facing Intense Pain:** When suffering intense pain during an illness, do not panic. This pain is the result of past karmic obstructions, or it may be a way to experience the suffering of the three evil realms in this life to quickly pay karmic debts.
  
*   **Avoid Emotional Attachments at Death:** At the time of death, do not ask about a will or engage in idle talk. This can cause emotional attachment and attachment to the world, which can hinder your rebirth.

*   **Prepare a Will in Advance:** If you wish to leave a will, it should be written during good health and entrusted to someone for safekeeping.

*  **Avoid Disturbing the Dying:** Before a person dies, the body will naturally be in pain. Forcing movement, bathing, or changing their clothes will only intensify their suffering.

*  **Disturbances:** Many people who have aspired to be reborn have been disturbed by their family, causing them to lose their correct thoughts and, therefore, fail to be reborn.

*   **Anger at the Moment of Death:** Some people, who could have been reborn in good realms, are angered by the touches of others, which causes them to be reborn in evil realms.
  
*   **Image of Amitabha Buddha:** When a group is reciting the Buddha’s name to help another, an image of Amitabha Buddha should be placed in the patient’s bedroom for them to look at.

*   **Assisted Recitation:** The number of people assisting with recitation is not important. If there are many people, they should rotate, reciting continuously. Whether reciting the six syllables or four, fast or slow, ask the patient, and recite in whatever manner they are used to and prefer, so that they can follow along silently in their mind.

*   **Following Habits:** Currently, those assisting with recitation follow their own preferences instead of asking the patient. Because the recitation goes against the patient’s usual habits, it is difficult for them to follow along silently. I hope that those assisting with recitation from now on will pay attention to this matter.

*   **The Importance of Not Moving the Deceased:** After death, the most important thing is to avoid rushing to move the body. Even if the body is soiled, you should not immediately try to wash it. You must wait eight hours before washing the body and changing the clothes. People are generally not aware of this, but it is extremely important. I hope you will all inform others and follow this advice carefully.

*  **Avoid Crying:** Before and after death, family members must absolutely not cry. How does crying help? Only helping with recitation will bring real benefit to the deceased. If you must cry, you must wait for eight hours after death.

*   **Protecting the Deceased:** After death, the recitation of the Buddha's name has ended, and the door to the room should be locked.  Prevent anyone from entering the room and touching the deceased. It is essential to wait eight hours before washing and changing the clothes. I have already stated this, but I will repeat it again: Remember this, remember this. Because if the body is moved within eight hours, the deceased person, even if unable to speak, will still feel pain.

*   **Addressing Rigor Mortis:** Eight hours after death, when clothing is put on, if the joints are stiff and do not move, then they should be washed with warm water. Use cloth soaked in warm water and wrap the elbows and knees. After a short while, they will be able to move like a living person.

*   **The Priority of Rebirth:** Those who practice the Pure Land tradition aim for rebirth in the Pure Land as their first priority. All other activities such as lecturing on sutras and composing texts are secondary. When the time comes, you should let go and go, and you should not have the slightest attachment or regret because you have not completed your work of promoting the Dharma.

**Master Dao Yuan's Teachings:**

*   **The Value of Key Practices:** Let us explore the value of the eight words: "abstaining from killing, releasing life, vegetarianism, and reciting the Buddha’s name." These eight words truly represent the essence of Buddhism and are its most significant achievements.

*   **The Importance of Practice:** Buddhist teachings place utmost importance on practice. What is practice? It is the correcting of negative behavior. Killing is the greatest negative behavior!

*   **The Pain of Being Killed:** All living beings have a desire for life. Being killed is extremely painful! It is heartless to kill them. This is evil of body, speech, and mind. It is completely against the Buddha’s compassionate nature. Those who create such evil karma will fall into hell. How can they become Buddhas?

*   **The Path of Non-Killing:** We urge Buddhist disciples to start by passively "abstaining from killing." Further, they should actively "release life."  If we ourselves are able to refrain from killing, then seeing other living beings being killed will arouse our compassionate hearts, and we should use various methods to save them.

*   **Eating Meat:** Is it reasonable to avoid killing ourselves while we allow others to kill for us so we can eat meat? Therefore, to completely abstain from killing, we must avoid eating the meat of any living being!

*   **Cultivating Merit:** Abstaining from killing, releasing life, and vegetarianism are three beneficial practices, but they cannot lead to liberation from birth and death. Only by eliminating negative karma can we be liberated. In this degenerate age, it is difficult for living beings to eliminate negative karma, but the practice of reciting the Buddha’s name does not require elimination of karma; one can achieve rebirth even with negative karma.

*   **Recitation is Primary:** The first three practices are supplementary, while reciting the Buddha’s name is the primary practice.

*   **The Realm of the Buddha:** In the ten realms of existence, the practice of reciting the Buddha's name puts us in the Buddha's realm. With each recitation, we manifest the Buddha's realm. When we continually recite the Buddha’s name, we continually manifest the Buddha's realm. Over time, our mind will be one with the Buddha. If that is the case, is there any chance we will fail to see the Buddha, fail to be reborn in the West, or fail to become a Buddha?

*   **Recite Simply:** Recite the Buddha’s name honestly, beginning with the simplest method, and you will attain the deepest results. Do not be overly ambitious or fickle.

*   **Relying on the Buddha:** Our own power is insufficient to eliminate afflictions, but relying on the Buddha’s power we can achieve rebirth while still having karma. Our own power causes many demons to disturb us, but the Buddha’s power can drive away demons. Self-power practices are complex and profound; it is difficult for people of ordinary capacity to understand them. The practice of reciting the Buddha’s name is simple and easy, and it cannot be misinterpreted. Relying on the Buddha’s power is more reliable and easier than relying on our own power.

*   **The Dharma Body:** Reciting the Buddha’s name is not about reciting any of the nine realms of existence, but reciting the Dharma body of the Buddha. The moment we recite the name, the entire Dharma body appears, and there is absolutely no room for afflictions to exist.

*   **Transformation Through Recitation:** Reciting the Buddha’s name is like absorbing the fragrance of the Buddha’s Dharma body. The fragrance of the Dharma body will awaken wisdom, and this light and fragrance will permeate our inherent nature. This is called "fragrance and light adornment."

*   **The Pure Land:** It is difficult to practice in this defiled world, but in the Pure Land, it is much easier to focus on spiritual practice.
   
*   **Faith and Vow:** Whether one achieves rebirth in the Pure Land or not depends on having faith and vows. In other words, as long as you have faith and vows, regardless of how much you recite the Buddha’s name, you will certainly be reborn in the West. This shows how important the two words ‘faith and vow’ are!
    
**Master Yuan Yin's Teachings:**
    
*   **Amitabha Buddha, the Teacher of All Buddhas:** Amitabha Buddha is the teacher of all Buddhas and the king of all Buddhas. Reciting one phrase “Amitabha Buddha” is equal to reciting all Buddhas of the ten directions and the three periods of time.

*  **The Merits of the Name:** Everything that Amitabha Buddha has realized and accomplished is completely condensed into the name "Namo Amitabha Buddha." In other words, this name "Namo Amitabha Buddha" includes everything that Amitabha Buddha has attained and accomplished.

*   **The All-Encompassing Name:** The name “Amitabha Buddha” contains all merits and virtues, encompassing all six paramitas and ten thousand practices. The name “Amitabha Buddha” contains all the principles, encompassing all the sutras and commentaries. The name “Amitabha Buddha” contains all Dharma Gates, including Zen, Teachings, Esoteric, and Vinaya.

*   **The Highest Form of Chan:** *The Great Collection Sutra* states, "If one only recites Amitabha, it is called the highest, most profound Chan." The name "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is Chan and it is the most profound Chan.

*   **The Name as Mantra:** The name “Namo Amitabha Buddha” is mantra. The six syllables are derived from Sanskrit and are not translated into Chinese, so it is the most simple and authentic mantra.

*   **The Essence of the Teachings:** All the sutras and commentaries are condensed into the name "Namo Amitabha Buddha," so reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is equal to reciting the entire Tripitaka.
 
*   **The Inconceivable Method:** Reciting the Buddha's name is the most superior, extraordinary, and inconceivable method. Only Buddhas can fully understand this method; those below the level of Equal Enlightenment can only understand a fraction of it, let alone ordinary people burdened with karma.

*   **The All-Encompassing Practice:** The name "Namo Amitabha Buddha" contains all perfect blessings and virtues, and encompasses all profound wisdom. By simply holding onto this name “Namo Amitabha Buddha,” one can encompass the entire ocean of Buddhist teachings. There is nothing lacking.

**Concluding Note:**
This translation aims to convey the meaning of the original text while being accessible to an English-speaking audience interested in Buddhist philosophy and practice. However, some nuances may be lost in translation. A reader familiar with Buddhist terminology may be able to grasp the deeper implications of certain phrases.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining a respectful tone appropriate for Buddhist teachings:

**Translation:**

*   **The entire essence of Buddhism is encapsulated in the phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha." In other words, this one phrase, "Namo Amitabha Buddha," is sufficient to represent the entirety of the Dharma.**

*   **The primary purpose of the World-Honored One's appearance in this defiled and turbulent world is embodied in the phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha." It is the supreme Dharma that fully realizes the original intention of the Buddha and is the ultimate essence of all the Tripitaka (Three Baskets of Buddhist scriptures).**

*   **The phrase "Namo Amitabha Buddha" surpasses all Chan (Zen), teachings, precepts, and esoteric (tantric) practices, and it encompasses them all. Therefore, Master Yin Guang said: “If beings in the nine realms depart from this path, they cannot perfectly accomplish Buddhahood; if Buddhas in the ten directions abandon this method, they cannot universally benefit all living beings.”**

*   **Speaking all the good words in the world is not as valuable as uttering a single phrase, "Namo Amitabha Buddha," in silence. Learning all the knowledge in the world is not as valuable as not knowing a single word and reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha."**

*   **If we are truly practicing Buddhism, the more we practice, the simpler we become; the more we practice, the more humble we become; the more we practice, the more ashamed we become. Ultimately, in our simplicity, our lives are filled with only the sacred name of "Amitabha Buddha." In our humility, we see all others as Bodhisattvas, while recognizing that we alone are still ordinary beings. In our shame, we give all credit for good deeds to others and take responsibility for all mistakes ourselves.**

*   **Those who truly practice mindfulness of Buddha (Nianfo) should bow to the Buddha daily. Consider the *Avatamsaka Sutra* (Flower Garland Sutra), esteemed as the king of sutras. A major focus of this great sutra is the Ten Great Vows of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, the first of which is "To pay homage to all Buddhas." This illustrates the importance of paying homage to the Buddha for spiritual cultivation.**

*   **One bow to the Buddha can extinguish sins like the sands of the Ganges River. The evil karma we have created over many lifetimes is as vast as space. If we do not bow to the Buddha to repent, how can we eliminate our mountain-like and ocean-like evil karma?**

*  **To claim that one need not bow to the Buddha while practicing mindfulness of the Buddha is just self-deceptive and evil talk from lazy people who indulge in indolence. Everyone must absolutely not follow such ideas.**

*  **Among all evils, killing is the most grievous because life is the most precious thing to all beings. When you kill them, they harbor the deepest resentment, and the resulting enmity becomes very strong. Debts paid in blood will have the most bitter and terrible future consequences.**

*  **The root of all illnesses comes from killing. All natural disasters, man-made calamities, cancers, epidemics, and all misfortunes are the karmic results of our past killings.**

*   **The *Lankavatara Sutra* states: "Eating meat is equivalent to killing." This is because meat comes from living beings that have been slaughtered. Eating meat is the same as killing. We eat meat every day, which is the same as creating killing karma every day. Three meals a day of meat is equal to owing three meals of killing debts.**

*   **The *Nirvana Sutra* states: "Those who eat meat sever the seed of great compassion." The Buddha's heart is the heart of compassion. However, those who eat meat have already cut off the seeds of great compassion, and so they can no longer cultivate compassion. This is against the Buddha's heart and renders all practice futile.**

*   **The *Surangama Sutra* states: "Those who eat meat will not accomplish any merit they seek." Creating killing karma by eating meat and incurring killing sins is the greatest obstacle for most Buddhist practitioners to be reborn in the Pure Land. Whether we eat vegetarian or not is a critical factor that determines if we rise or fall. Everyone must not take this matter lightly!**

*   **The World-Honored One, out of great compassion, taught us in the Bodhisattva Precepts of the *Brahma Net Sutra*: “Due to compassionate hearts, we should engage in the practice of releasing life.” Releasing life is to generate compassion, to spend effort and money to rescue beings who are in distress, suffering, and about to be slaughtered. Because the most precious thing for all living beings is their life, the merit of releasing life is greatest, and the karmic connections created are deepest. It is a supreme auxiliary practice to be born in the Pure Land, in addition to the main practice of reciting the Buddha's name.**

*   **The Bodhisattva Precepts of the *Brahma Net Sutra* state: "The Dharma of constancy is to teach people to release life." This is because the compassion of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors. Likewise, the hopes of all living beings for freedom and survival will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors. Therefore, releasing life is a constant method, it is always unchanging and always feasible. It will never change due to any environmental or temporal factors.**

*   **The greatly virtuous Master Lian Chi, who dedicated his life to vigorously promoting the practice of releasing life, exhorted us: "The *Brahma Net Sutra* regards releasing life as a constant Dharma. Those who are constant are the diamond body and possess immeasurable life."**

*   **Releasing life is an act of saving lives in emergency, so its merit is extremely great, not comparable to other minor acts of goodness.**

*  **Releasing life is the best way to nurture a compassionate heart.**

*   **Being vegetarian is just to cease evil. It is to passively stop creating new killing karma and stop incurring new killing debts. Whereas releasing life is to promote good, it is to actively and further rescue lives and repay the killing debts we incurred before. Being vegetarian and releasing life are two sides of the same coin. They need to be interdependent and go hand in hand for the effects to be noticeable.**

*   **Depending on the size of each person's mind and the level of their wisdom, there are completely different reactions and views towards releasing life. The greater the mind and the higher the wisdom, the more pure and simple the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are in generating the compassionate thought of rescuing lives. They have no considerations, no purpose, and no discrimination. Ordinary beings are plagued with distracting thoughts, discrimination and attachments, they are hesitant, and even ridicule and criticize. The smaller the mind and lower the wisdom, the more opinions one will have, and the deeper the slander and the more intense the obstruction!**

*   **Even when faced with the most harsh, dangerous, and polluted environments, no matter the time or place, as long as there is an opportunity, if one sees a living being in danger, suffering, and distress, a person with a compassionate heart will absolutely not sit idly by and watch it die. They will do their best to rescue that being. Whereas a person without compassion will only make excuses, hesitate, and never extend a helping hand, watching helplessly as living beings are brutally killed!**

*   **The issue of releasing life is really just about whether one has a compassionate heart or not.**

*  **Even if everyone in the world opposes releasing life and criticizes releasing life, I will still insist on releasing life my whole life, and I will promote releasing life my whole life, because all beings are our past parents and future Buddhas. To watch them die and allow them to be slaughtered is not something a human being should do!**

*   **Reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha," the six-syllable Great Name, is the greatest act of releasing life, and it contains the most important and ultimate meaning of releasing life!**

*   **The four essential points of practicing Buddhism are: 'Sincerely reciting the Buddha's name, bowing to the Buddha for repentance, abstaining from killing and being vegetarian, and rescuing lives by releasing them.'**
