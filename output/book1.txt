**Editor's Preface**

"Hoping one's son becomes a dragon, and one's daughter a phoenix," is the aspiration of every parent. "To discover talent for the world" is the ambition of every educator. How can we become the guiding light in the lives of our own children, our students, and even everyone around us, using the lamp of love and wisdom to illuminate each other’s path?

In July 2013, the China Teacher Development Foundation and the National Teacher Research Foundation, under the "Twelfth Five-Year Plan" key project, the “Action Research on Chinese School Legal Education,” organized a principal training class in Nanjing with the theme "Learning Traditional Culture to Become Moral Educators." Mr. Cai Lixu was invited to give a free lecture on the topic "Being a Guiding Light in a Child’s Life," which consisted of six class sessions. As the lectures in Nanjing were not yet complete, Mr. Cai continued to record this course every Saturday after returning to the Malaysian Chinese Cultural Education Center, adding another seventeen class sessions. Therefore, the total series of lectures on this topic comprised twenty-three sessions.

With a sincere and selfless heart, Mr. Cai has shared his profound understanding of the five thousand years of Chinese educational wisdom, as well as his over ten years of experience in promoting culture and nurturing talent, generously offering it to the public. This series of lectures is another brilliant presentation by Mr. Cai, following his "Happy Life Lecture" and "Detailed Explanation of the *Di Zi Gui*." It is not only worth careful contemplation by all parents and educators, but also worthy of reference for entrepreneurs and team leaders who strive for the happiness of their employees and the inspiration of the public.

In light of this, our lecture notes team has slightly reorganized Mr. Cai's lecture transcripts for the benefit of our readers. We kindly ask that you, our esteemed readers, not hesitate to offer your valuable guidance if you find any improper compilation or textual errors.

**Lecture 1: Explanation of the Topic**

Respected Mr. and Mrs. Ye, Secretary-General Mo, Teacher Chen, fellow educators, esteemed elders, brothers and sisters, good morning to you all!

It is a great joy to see all of you principals and fellow educators here. Confucius said, "It is a pleasure to have friends coming from afar." The backdrop on our stage is a field of rapeseed flowers. The countless beautiful blooms remind us that all of you principals and educators are diligently working and thinking for the happiness of children's lives. Your dedication will surely blossom in the lives of the children, like this rapeseed field. Behind each of you principals, you may be influencing the happiness of tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of children's lives. Therefore, the topic I will be discussing with you today is "Being a Guiding Light in a Child's Life."

Since arriving at the Nanjing Ju Meixin Education Center yesterday, I have been continually moved. Last night, during everyone's self-introductions, a common saying came to mind: "To have one true friend in life is enough to die without regret." Listening to the principals share, I felt that here, we have met many kindred spirits; there is a sense of deep understanding and appreciation for one another. I also experienced what the classics tell us: "Virtue is never alone, it is bound to have neighbors" and "all within the four seas are brothers." Furthermore, today's gathering is an opportunity for us to form a teaching team on the path of promoting sage education. Over a hundred of us will join hands and work together. We can share our good experiences and examples with each other, and that power will be truly immense.

In the past, we fought alone. Now we have met all of these like-minded people from across our motherland, these principals who have a deep sense of mission for education. It is a truly extraordinary gathering. As the saying goes, "understand the affinity, cherish the affinity, create the affinity," and this will create happiness for the teachers, colleagues, and children in all of our schools. We also have the principle of "know gratitude, feel gratitude, repay gratitude." We are grateful to the Nanjing Ju Meixin Education Center for its commitment to promoting sage education and the future of education. They have a deep sense of mission and have put in so much effort to organize this course during the summer holiday. We also appreciate the organizers, the China Teacher Development Foundation under the Ministry of Education, the National Teacher Research Foundation, and this project team, who have worked together with the Ju Meixin Center to bring about this gathering. Behind it all are these dedicated people, with their great care and consideration. In addition, the entire Ju Meixin staff takes good care of us, ensuring we eat and sleep well. We are truly grateful for everything.

Therefore, knowing the gratitude, knowing the effort made by so many people, whenever we meet a staff member, we should show a bright smile to thank them for their contribution. And not just here; back in our schools, let’s thank all the teachers and colleagues for working together, and thank all the parents for their support of the school. We are all living in a world of gratitude.

In fact, as long as a person has a grateful heart, they are bound to be happy. Knowing gratitude, feeling gratitude, what follows is? Repaying gratitude. Through our own self-improvement, and by putting it into practice in our schools, we can truly establish and promote ethics and moral education, making our schools models of schools implementing ethics and moral education in China. This is called illuminating the vast land of China. We already have role models, like Teacher Wang Qi from Songhua River Middle School in Jilin. She devotedly worked in her class, neither seeking fame nor gain, simply hoping to give her children a good future. Just imagine, how much power can one person's sincerity unleash? It might be hard to imagine. It’s like a seed falling into the soil. It roots, it sprouts, it grows strong, and then bears much fruit. And in these fruits, there are more seeds. One single seed can eventually produce many fruits and many seeds, which fall onto the ground and grow into more big trees. That seed is a person's good heart, a mission for education. It can create immense power.

Teacher Wang Qi is a great example, a role model. She single-handedly managed her class extremely well. Principal Lu Jie is also a very dedicated principal. When he passed by her class, he noticed how focused the children were and how unaffected they were by external distractions. It left a deep impression on him. During the flag-raising ceremony, he saw that her students were vibrant and orderly, without any restless movements, and had a commanding presence. These impressions led him to investigate. He discovered that Teacher Wang Qi had incorporated traditional Chinese culture, including ethics and moral education, filial piety, and character development, into her teaching. He was overjoyed and moved, and decided to promote this from one class to the entire school.

Because the school implemented the initiative school-wide, character improved very quickly. By chance, that year's national college entrance exam was held at their school. Upon entering the school gate, there was a statue of Confucius. As it was an exam site, many students from different schools came, not just those from Songhua River Middle School. But all the students from Songhua River Middle School respectfully bowed to the statue of Confucius before entering. The education officials in charge of the exam were surprised to see these students bowing so reverently to the statue of Confucius. They thought it was a beautiful sight. After making inquiries, they discovered that all these students were from Songhua River Middle School, and that's how their school began to gain attention from the educational community. That year, the school's results on the college entrance exam dramatically improved. Their usual percentage of high scoring students had been about half of that of another school. But that year, they surpassed that other school by a factor of two. Thus their academic performance rapidly improved. And the entire educational community in Northeast China was influenced by Songhua River Middle School. It became known as the "Songhua River Middle School Effect."

Just think, how much impact can one person create? How much impact can one class create? How much impact can one school create? The greater the aspiration, the greater the power. Our ancestors taught us principles that are the truth of life. Every person can verify these truths as long as they truly contemplate and practice them. Just as the last sentence in the *Di Zi Gui* tells us, “Do not give up on yourself, do not abandon yourself. With diligence, one can reach the level of a sage or a worthy.” The word "reach" means that as long as we are willing to put our heart into it, we can achieve the realm of sages and worthies.

The opening lines of *The Great Learning* tells us, "In ancient times, those who wished to illuminate their luminous virtue throughout the world," which demonstrates a world-embracing perspective on the values of life. "First governed their nation; those who wished to govern their nation, first ordered their families." We now have our own families, and our schools, which are also great families. "Those who wished to order their families, first cultivated their personal lives; those who wished to cultivate their personal lives, first rectified their hearts," and the heart is the basis of personal cultivation. “Those who wished to rectify their hearts, first made their intentions sincere; those who wished to make their intentions sincere, first extended their knowledge; the extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things." So, where does the foundation lie? Investigating things. When things are investigated, then knowledge is extended, then intentions are made sincere, then the heart is rectified, then personal life is cultivated, then the family is ordered, then the nation is governed, and then the world is at peace. And the "investigation of things" means what? It means eliminating bad habits and eliminating material desires. The lighter a person's troubles are, the greater their wisdom will grow.

People today have too many material desires; "desire obscures wisdom, profit makes one lose their senses." They pursue quick results and immediate benefits. They are like tasting honey on the edge of a knife. They would rather take a taste of sweetness, neglecting the fact that their tongue might be cut off. In fact, isn’t this what humanity is doing now? In just a few short decades, they have turned a beautiful planet into many places that are uninhabitable. Especially in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, as the saying goes, "In heaven, there is paradise, and on Earth, there is Suzhou and Hangzhou." How many beautiful places were there in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area. When we were children, the ditches were clear, and fish were swimming there. And now? The pollution is rapid and severe. Scientists have already pointed out that many regions are uninhabitable, and some areas, which used to be beautiful mountains and clear waters, have been polluted into high-risk areas for cancer. Isn't this depriving future generations of their place to live? Isn’t this like tasting honey on the edge of a knife? Just for a little bit of sweetness, the tongue is cut off. Just for a little bit of sweetness, immediate gain takes priority, neglecting and destroying future generations.

Now, it’s not just one area that is pursuing quick results; it’s the entire world that is pursuing quick results and is being polluted by utilitarianism. That's why the whole world is facing similar problems: environmental pollution, and also rising juvenile crime rates. This is a problem worldwide, reminding humanity that without a good next generation, will humanity even have a future? Yet people are pursuing money and have forgotten about the most important thing in life: educating the next generation. They value profit over righteousness! Our ancestors taught us that, "Among the three acts of unfilial piety, not having descendants is the greatest." Humanity cannot just think about the present moment.

As parents and as teachers, our two roles are the most honorable on Earth. We have the greatest impact on our children's lives. Think back, what is the first word a child learns to say? Women will say "Mama," and men will say "Papa." Husbands and wives should not fight about this. “Learning 'Papa' first,” or “learning ‘Mama’ first,” arguing over this is not okay. Harmony between husband and wife has a decisive influence on a child’s lifelong healthy personality.

From the time a child starts babbling, when they can finally speak fluently and can speak whole sentences, out of ten sentences, how many are “my dad said,” or “my mom said?” Quite a few, right? I think more than half. So, every parent was once the idol of their child, right? Your children are your fans. This is innate. The love between parents and children is innate. The most precious goal of education is to maintain the filial love between parent and child for the rest of their lives. This person is the happiest in the world. This feeling can only be known through experience. When we kneel down, thinking of our parents’ lifelong care and education, and kowtow to them, having kowtowed three times, we can finally understand that kneeling and kowtowing is so much more comfortable than standing. That connection to the innate virtue within brings great joy and expresses our gratitude towards our parents. The feeling of having washed a parent’s feet is definitely different from that of not having done so. “To learn something and practice it regularly, isn’t it a joy?” The joy of putting something into practice can definitely be felt.

I was very touched by a statement made by director Zhai Junjie on the “Parents All Over the World” program. Someone asked him what he felt was the most happiness in life, and he, being over sixty years of age, said, "The greatest happiness in my life is returning to my home, opening the door, and being able to call out 'Mother'." When hearing a man in his sixties saying such words, do you visualize anything? Is there a similarity between a man in his sixties and a toddler who can’t even walk steadily? Have you seen toddlers, who can't yet walk very steadily, suddenly see their parents and burst into a smile? They teeter as they walk, calling “Mama,” and run to hug their mother’s or father's legs, as if they are the happiest people on Earth, right? Do they have money? Do they have status? But they are the happiest people. Yet, we, who have money and status, don't smile as brightly as they do, right? Yes, this makes us think a lot.

According to scientific experiments, one to two-year-olds smile an average of one hundred and eighty times a day. I believe this number is correct. Why? Just recently my colleague had a child, who is four months old, and we are neighbors. The first key point is that he did a good job with prenatal education. His mother often read classical traditional Chinese texts to him, so he doesn’t cry. Sometimes he fusses a little, but as soon as she reads the classics to him, he stops crying. It’s very effective. Furthermore, I often go visit him. His nickname is Shuer, meaning "the way of loyalty and forgiveness," to encourage him to practice it throughout his life. You see, parents with a cultural foundation know that they should give their child a name that reflects the classics. They should guide his life with teachings that align with the classics, benefiting his entire life with correct thinking. I often visit this child at their home. Even when no one is talking to him, he smiles to himself. He just chuckles. So it’s definitely true that they can smile one hundred and eighty times.

That's the translation. I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any other requests.


Okay, here's my professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural flow while preserving the essence of the original:

**Translation:**

But after people reach adulthood, they smile an average of seven times a day.

This scientific finding leads us to consider a question: What is the goal of human existence? What is the purpose of living? It’s to pursue happiness and well-being for ourselves, and also for the happiness and well-being of our families. Do you agree? If so, good. In fact, everyone agrees with this statement. Our ancestors taught us this in the very first line of the classics: "The Great Learning teaches the way of illuminating one's luminous virtue, loving the people, and resting in the highest good." This is the value of our lives. "Illuminating one's luminous virtue."  "Luminous virtue" refers to the inherent goodness within us; “illuminating” signifies wisdom, and “virtue” represents moral power and blessings.  We can restore ourselves to the boundless wisdom, moral power, and blessings that were possessed by Confucius and Mencius.

Take King Shun, for example. "Shun was indeed a great example of filial piety!" His filial piety reached its peak, and his wisdom was also manifested, because filial piety can unlock a person's luminous virtue. The *Doctrine of the Mean* states, "He was indeed greatly filial! His virtue attained the sage level." By vigorously practicing filial piety, he ultimately attained the realm of sagehood. "His virtue became that of a sage, and his honor became that of the Son of Heaven." He was able to become the Son of Heaven, and his blessings were the greatest in the world. Moreover, what else? His moral power was also high. The *Analects* also state that King Shun was very wise; he was able to "respectfully govern himself and then face the south (to rule)." By doing well himself, he set an example. "Facing the south" means governing the world. He used only five people to stabilize the world; of course, these five people were all sages, who managed the most important affairs. King Shun was able to govern the world. Did he have moral power and ability? Yes, he did. Therefore, he restored his “luminous virtue.”  Yao and Shun restored it, and the sages of all generations restored it.

Therefore, "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Those who make the effort can be like him!” Sages and virtuous people do not deceive. They say that as long as people are truly willing to follow the teachings, they can all attain the realm of sagehood. This statement must be the truth. We cannot doubt the classics, and even more so, we cannot doubt ourselves. If people doubt themselves, they will fall like a mountain collapsing.  "Heaven helps those who help themselves; Heaven abandons those who abandon themselves."  If we abandon ourselves, even if Confucius were to come back, he would be unable to help us. All sages, virtuous people, and those we encounter in life, are contributing factors to our lives. The most important thing is ourselves. We must be willing to stand on our own feet, be self-reliant, and strive for our own good fortune. Only then can these contributing factors have a positive impact.

The *Great Learning* states, "Illuminating one's luminous virtue.” When a person recovers their boundless wisdom and moral power, they will certainly be happy.  So, we just said that we strive for our own happiness throughout our lives. Furthermore, we strive for those we are connected to in life, our families, our colleagues (teachers at school), and all of our students; this is called “loving the people.” The "people,” in governing a nation, refers to all the people, even the entire world.  Therefore, this means cherishing the relationships between people and helping all of them achieve fulfilling lives. When we do "illuminating one's luminous virtue" and "loving the people" to their utmost extent, we are “resting in the highest good.”

And this scientific experiment shows that, on average, people smile only seven times a day after reaching adulthood. If adults smile seven times a day, let me ask you, how many times do people smile when they are seventy?  That's hard to say. But have you ever encountered people who are eighty or ninety years old who smile very brightly, returning to their true nature? Yes, I have. My teachers, they live their lives like that, smiling brilliantly, like children, and their skin is also like a child’s. Singapore’s national treasure, Madam Xu Zhe, lived to be 114. When we were in Malaysia, she was 112, and we invited her to come. She smiled just like a child, very innocent.

So this is what people should strive for. Otherwise, the more we live, the less we smile, making ourselves miserable and scaring others when we go out. So a person should do more good deeds and accumulate virtue. First of all, don’t have a murderous look on your face. If people tremble when they talk to us, we are harming them. Therefore, we are told to have "no anger on our face." No murderous intent, no anger. Be "respectful in everything." Treat people with utmost respect, giving them a very positive impression. It feels very comfortable to interact with this kind of person, like a gentle spring breeze. They must be students of traditional culture. We are giving honor to our ancestors, aren't we? If you are always smiling, spreading joy wherever you go.

Therefore, "people can spread the Way." The teachings in the classics are reflected in your being, and wherever you go, the Way is spread. If today we can only recite the classics, but our behavior does not align with them, people will become averse, thinking, "They are just all talk and demand it of others, but they don't practice it themselves." That will smear the name of the sages’ teachings. That is not good.

Let’s calmly consider things. Because in this era, with the development of technology, ideologies are flourishing, and there is simply too much information every day. If you ask someone a question about life, you might get ten different answers from ten different people. Maybe even eleven or twelve. Why? Because some people might give you an answer in the morning, and then call you in the afternoon with a different answer. Therefore, people's hearts are restless. What is the correct way of thinking about life? At this time, what is needed? We must first calm down and settle. The more stable, less agitated, and purer our hearts become, the more wisdom we will have. If you look at a lake surface, when there are no ripples or waves, you can clearly see the reflection of objects on its side. Once waves appear, the reflections become unclear.

Where is the truth? It is right before our eyes, in every day of our lives. Do you all believe this? For example, yesterday was the ceremony for Confucius’s birthday. The day before, we were going to practice, but it rained too heavily, so we couldn’t. But yesterday, it didn’t rain.  When the entire ceremony finished, what happened? The rain came down again. What did everyone realize? Heaven can be reasoned with. We have heard too many of these kinds of stories, and we have experienced too many of them ourselves.

The “Parents of the World” program team was in Jiaxiang County, the hometown of Zengzi (one of Confucius’s disciples). Just as they were establishing a filial piety village, the leaders had scheduled the event, but it rained constantly in the days prior. If you wanted to reschedule, that’s very difficult for leaders, who are very busy. So they had to carry on. When the time came to start, the rain stopped. When the opening address began, the whole process lasted for half an hour, and it didn’t rain. When the half hour was about to be over, everyone took a group photo, very happy. As soon as the photo was finished, the rain came down. It was such a perfect coincidence. How could things be so coincidental?

In 2007, we went to Shenyang, where more than 300 teachers from across Liaoning province were being trained. The officials from their side had previously come to the Lujiang Training Center for a course to familiarize themselves with the curriculum, so they could use it as reference when they returned. At that particular time, our lecture had more than 1,000 people participating. They had to eat in three separate locations. It was raining that day, so we were thinking that the center didn’t have 1,000 umbrellas, and no organization would have 1,000 umbrellas. They wouldn’t have purchased so many. But when class was over, the rain stopped. When people went to the three dining areas to eat, it started to rain again. After about 20-30 minutes, when everyone had finished eating and was going to go back to rest, the rain stopped again. It was perfectly coordinated. This example was shared when I was having dinner with the Director of the Education Bureau of Liaoning Province. The officials told the Director, “Wow, it’s too magical.  We went to class, with more than a thousand people, and heaven can be reasoned with and can cooperate.” It's better for an education official to say these things. If I said them, people might have objections to me, right?

So what is the principle behind this? The teachings of our ancestors. Where is this wisdom? It's in the concept of "the harmony of heaven and humanity."  What is "heaven"? All natural phenomena. It all corresponds to the human heart; it's not separate. The *Book of Documents* states, "Those who do good will be met with myriad blessings; those who do evil will be met with myriad misfortunes."  These words in the classics are the truth of life. When we understand this statement, we will understand the root of solving problems is in transforming people's hearts.

Where does the greatest crisis of the Chinese people lie?  It is in our loss of national self-confidence. We don’t learn from our own classics, and we study foreign things more. I came into contact with the classics of our ancestors first, and then some newer theories. If the new theories are correct, I can guarantee to everyone that any correct theory you learn can be found in our several-thousand-year-old classics. All of the good words in the world, our ancestors have said them all, because they were immensely compassionate towards future generations.

We need to be calm. Ask yourselves, are the hearts of the sages and ancestors thousands of years ago purer and less desirous, or are the hearts of people today? The ancestors and sages were purer. A pure heart generates wisdom. People today are more restless, and many of their views are not necessarily correct. Confucius was a sage with great wisdom, yet he left us an approach to learning that is so precious, called, "transmit, but not create; believe and love the ancient." He believed the teachings of ancient sages and virtuous people, without any doubt. And what he spoke was all from the teachings of ancient sages and virtuous people. He did not come up with his own inventions: “He followed the teachings of Yao and Shun and modeled himself after the ways of Wen and Wu."

Therefore, if someone says, "This idea or theory of mine, no one before has ever said," then you better not believe that person's theory. It’s certainly wrong. Those who have attained enlightenment are all like Confucius, "transmitting, but not creating; believing and loving the ancient." We now all talk about innovation. In fact, what must we grasp first in innovation? Unchanging principles.  If we deviate from benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, all innovation will bring enormous danger to the world. If it does not go beyond these five constant virtues, then what is there to create or invent? Aren't all these things extensions of our inherent virtue? And aren’t these extensions a result of first learning ethical relations from our sages and ancestors?  How then can they pat their chests and say they have invented these things?

So, when people today say they have new things of their own, this in itself is already arrogant. The two most important spirits of traditional culture are filial piety and the way of teachers. The way of teachers must be passed down from one generation to another. Confucius himself also inherited the entire lineage of the Way. It is because we have received the teachings of our teachers that we are able to understand these principles, so we are grateful our whole lives. How could we then say that everything was created and invented on our own?

Furthermore, in our generation, the passing down of teacher's wisdom is facing a major crisis, because very few people carry it forward. My teacher is 87 years old this year. When he was a child, he still attended a private school for a few months. He received the education of traditional culture. His younger brother, six years his junior, did not come into contact with it.  Instead, the emphasis was on knowledge and skills, the Western education system.  The Western education system has its merits. But we must calmly observe a phenomenon:  The education systems around the world are all similar now. Yet the crime rate of the next generation worldwide is increasing, and the quality of the next generation is declining.  Family education and school education need to be seriously reconsidered.

I myself teach on the front lines of education, and what do I see? It's not that each generation is worse than the last, but that each class is worse than the previous class. A few days ago, I received a call from a university teacher. He lamented and told me, “It’s not just that each year is worse than the previous year, but each day is worse than the previous day.” Social pollution is very serious. A child may commit a mistake that leads to eternal regret just because they were not exposed to the teachings of the sages for even one day. Therefore, bringing the ethical and moral principles of our ancestors into everyone's lives is as urgent as putting out a fire.  If you do not tell them, they may fall.

Professor Liu Yuli of the Central Party School once gave a lecture to officials.  She talked about Song Hong of the Eastern Han dynasty. At the time, Emperor Guangwu wanted to marry his widowed elder sister, Princess Huyang, to Song Hong.  That would make Song Hong an in-law of the imperial family, the emperor’s brother-in-law.  Emperor Guangwu spoke to Song Hong using common sayings. He said, "When people become wealthy, they change friends; when they become rich and noble, they change wives. Is this human nature?” He was hinting at Song Hong. Ancient people were very wise; they studied the *Book of Odes* and understood the meaning beyond the words. Song Hong immediately said: "The friends of one's days of poverty and humble beginnings cannot be forgotten."  Friends who helped me when I was in hardship and poverty, even for a single drop of kindness, I cannot forget. “A wife who has shared a life of hardship should not be abandoned.” We should remember the kindness and the love of the partner who persevered with us through all the trials and tribulations, we cannot abandon her. When Emperor Guangwu heard these words, he felt ashamed. So, this statement became a famous saying throughout history. There is a story of this in the *Essential Writings for Governing the Nation* and also in the *Moral Education Textbook*. After Professor Liu Yuli told this story, one official came to thank her, saying, “I was just about to go through with a divorce in the next few days. After listening to your story, I realized how wrong I was, that I wasn’t acting human. I must go and apologize to my wife immediately.” Just imagine, how much impact did Professor Liu’s lecture have on this official’s life, his family, and his future generations?

Therefore, we can understand that our colleagues and our children are facing so many temptations today. We must quickly lead them to the correct way of thinking and help them so they will not be tainted by this society, as lotus flowers grow from mud, but are not defiled. If we truly have this sense of urgency, we will study traditional culture with courage and vigor, without needing others to remind or push us. Why? Because we will have this heart of benevolence and universal love. We must improve ourselves so that we can help others; we must become enlightened in order to enlighten others. Otherwise, if we have not studied well, we will not be able to help people. As the saying goes, "a clay Buddha cannot cross the river, unable to save even himself.” This state of mind is a sense of righteousness.

Earlier, I discussed the experiment of the scientists, which should make people in this era consider things calmly. As children, we laugh 180 times a day, but as adults, we only laugh seven times. Have you ever met anyone who said, "I work so hard and diligently every day so that I can laugh less and less"? Have you ever met any friends or family members like that? No. If you have, you might need to send them to a mental hospital. Right? There aren't such people, but the vast majority of people in the world are living their lives in this way, laughing less and less. Isn't that running contrary to the goals of life? If we continue to laugh less and less, can we be mentors to others? If we teach people to laugh less and less, aren’t we making their lives more miserable?

There was a graduate student in a research program who felt very miserable from all the studying he was doing. He wondered, Confucius said, "To study and at due time practice what one has learned, is that not a pleasure?" How come the more I study, the more miserable I become? Then, he was in the library preparing his thesis. He was so overwhelmed that he went outside. He saw some residents strolling through the campus of the teachers’ college, walking their dogs. Then this graduate student was watching the dog and thought, “How come it is so free and at ease?”  How come my life can’t even compare with that of a dog? He felt very disheartened. Finally, he mustered the courage to ask his head teacher: "Teacher, how come I feel more miserable the more I study and the more I live? Life should be about pursuing happiness." His head teacher told him: "I feel the same way." He didn't give up. He found their department's most popular teacher and asked the same question, "How come I am getting more miserable?" The most popular teacher looked at him with a solemn and righteous expression and said, "Life is just like that!"  If life is inherently miserable, and we live in a way that makes it more miserable, no wonder suicide rates are increasing. If it is more and more miserable, why bother to live? Therefore, people have been living their lives all wrong. “To study and at due time practice what one has learned, is that not a pleasure?” is the correct way.

Actually, in the first sentence of the *Analects*, “At due time practice what one has learned,” what does “at due time” mean? It means to maintain it constantly. “Practice” means to put it into practice. When you truly act on it, joy will come. When you treat people with respect, offering them a bright smile and saying, "Good morning!" the other person will be very happy, and what about you?  You will also be very happy. Therefore, the respect that one gives to others first nourishes one’s own mind and body. When you extend love to others today, it will first nourish your own mind and body. Therefore, "the benevolent live long." Why do benevolent people live long? Because their minds and thoughts are full of benevolence, and the energy around them is the best, in a state of perfect harmony. Just like when we recite the words of gratitude in the morning, how does it feel in our minds and bodies? Very joyful and peaceful. Our entire being is within a field of gratitude. "Is that not a pleasure?" Confucius did not deceive us, did he?  We used to think that studying was miserable, and how could it be joyful? Because we had learned the wisdom that can benefit us our whole lives and turned it into mere knowledge, only used for tests. It was meant to be of great use, but now, we use it as an ordinary object and even throw it aside and don’t use it. It is such a pity.

"To have friends come from far away, is that not a joy?" With more than a hundred like-minded people gathered together, isn’t Confucius’s words being realized? "To not be upset when others do not know you, is that not the mark of a gentleman?" Some people might come here for a day or two, be very excited, and call their family members to share what’s happening here. When you share so excitedly, your wife or husband might say, “Do you have a fever?”  People who do not understand your feelings might think you’re a little abnormal. At this time, “others do not understand,” and they are not able to understand your feelings. “But be not upset.”  "Be not upset" means you don't have any discomfort in your heart, no emotions. We treat it calmly when others do not understand us. "To not be upset when others do not know you, is that not the mark of a gentleman?"

And all of you principals and colleagues, after your 21-day training here, you will go back and meet many people who don't understand you, won't you? Yes, you will.  You will be coming down from heaven to the ordinary world, you need to adjust. At this time, "To not be upset when others do not know you, is that not the mark of a gentleman?"

First, I'll share this saying with everyone as encouragement: "What is wrong with others is also right, and what is right with me is also wrong." If this is a bit confusing, let's discuss it together. Why is what is wrong with others also right?  That “right” refers to the normal phenomenon, the common phenomenon, because they have not learned yet.  "If people do not learn, they do not know"; "If people do not learn, they do not know righteousness."

If people do not learn, who is responsible? It is the parents and the teachers. We do not blame others. The *Three Character Classic* tells us, "If there is only nurturing but no teaching, it is the father’s fault; if there is teaching but no strictness, it is the teacher’s laziness." Behind every honorable position is a responsibility that must be fulfilled.  Among heaven and earth, there are three most honorable roles: the ruler, parents, and teachers. For thousands of years, the memorial tablets in most families' ancestral halls are inscribed with the words: "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher." This shows us that our ancestors had hearts filled with gratitude towards all things in the universe. Therefore, the term "environmental protection" is also a foreign term. Because for the past 5,000 years, we have been respecting heaven, earth, and all things, and even during harvests, we show respect to the rivers because they have allowed us to have today's bountiful harvest. The gratitude of ancient people was so admirable. Even the first temple built in the Han Dynasty was called the White Horse Temple. Because at that time, this white horse carried many Buddhist scriptures back. The horse was so tired that it eventually died. Our ancestors were grateful to a horse and could not forget its kindness, so they named the first temple the White Horse Temple. From these historical events, we can understand the valuable attitude of our ancient people, which was, "When you drink the water, remember the source, know kindness, and repay kindness."

Now, because traditional culture has been neglected for several generations, no one has learned it. It would be too harsh to criticize those who have not learned. We should not blame those who do not know. “To punish one without teaching is cruelty.” This is stated in the *Analects*. If you punish someone without first teaching them, it is an act of cruelty to the people or students. Therefore, "Our ancestors were not good." The last few generations did not place importance on it and did not pass it down. "They do not know ethics and morality, and no one has told them. They cannot be blamed." The ancients taught us that we should be generous and kind in our approach to things, and not be harsh.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and natural flow:

**Title: Compassion, Not Condemnation: Understanding and Guiding Others**

We hold this attitude: when others misunderstand us, or when others do wrong, we do not blame them, nor do we stand in opposition to them. Instead, what arises? A heart of compassion. We can tolerate and accept the faults of others, even to the point of thinking: How can I quickly help them?

If everyone calmly thinks about it, there are no wicked people under heaven, only pitiful ones. Why do we feel someone is detestable? Because we cling to the words they used to scold us, we cling to the despicable things they did. Once we cling to these things, anger and antagonism arise. This is not helpful to ourselves, nor to the other person, and it further obscures the root cause of the issue. Ask yourself: is it a person’s severely negative behavior the cause or the result? The cause is a lack of education and a lack of love. Should you be angry with someone who has not had the loving care of parents and teachers? They are to be pitied.

Everyone who comes into this world is innocent and pure. When children are born, each and every one is adorable. I remember when I went to the nursery, my impression was very deep. Visiting hours were limited. When looking at the babies, of course, people first look at their own children, their own offspring. But you can’t help but be drawn to the innocent faces nearby. Human nature is inherently good, and it’s clear on the faces of newborns. They are happy with anyone who holds them, they do not discriminate, they are not attached.

Has anyone ever gone to the nursery to see these children and then say, “I’m telling you, that one is a murderer; that one will be a repeat offender; that one will make their parents miserable?” Is that possible? No. They are all so innocent. But then, why do they become the way they do? So, when you get angry at someone, when you really can’t stand a student, immediately picture them as a newborn, or keep a photo of them as a baby. Then, every time you get angry at a particular student, look at that picture, reminding yourself, "This child was once this adorable." And then a feeling of compassion will suddenly arise. Why has a child who was once so innocent become like this now? Their parents divorced; their parents were irresponsible; they didn’t teach them. They are even mixed up with gangs in society. How pitiful. Seeing it from the root cause, they are to be pitied. This is what I personally experienced in my two or three years of teaching.

There was a student who had already been expelled from three schools. Our school was his fourth. At school, he was also a bully and notoriously bad. Once, he made a serious mistake and received severe punishment. He looked so dejected, sitting on the stairs. I saw his back, and I could feel his emotions, so I sat down next to him for a while. Of course, that was when he needed the most care and attention. After sitting with him for a while, he started to tell me what was on his mind. He said, “Teacher, I really want to die.” I asked, “Why do you want to die?” He said, “Nobody likes me.” Then I guided him, “Why don’t people like you?” “Because I hit people, I swear at people.” He knew it himself; he couldn’t control himself because he had been without proper guidance for too long. I then told him, “Then don’t hit people, don’t swear at people, and then people won’t dislike you. If you change, you will become a popular person.”

I guided him like this, and I gave him books to read about the noble conduct of sages. A few days later, he had drawn a portrait of a sage, one he had seen in the book, on the back of his hand. He covered it with his other hand and circled around the office, shyly. I saw him out of the corner of my eye, and from his expression, I knew he was trying to get my attention. But I pretended not to notice. "Who are you looking for? What's the matter?" He said he was looking for me, and slowly, he removed his hand. The drawing was really good, my drawing talent wasn't as good as his. So, every trade produces its masters. It's not just the academically gifted who have a bright future. Every child has deep talents and special abilities. If discovered, they could become leaders in their respective fields.

Just imagine, how long did that child spend drawing that sage's image? If he spent an hour, what was on his mind for that whole hour? He was fully focused on thinking about the sage. It is just that his circumstances were different. If he had met good parents and teachers who had taught him and immersed him in the teachings of sages, then he could have achieved great things in this life. But because his parents did not teach him, and the media polluted his mind, of course he became more and more degenerate. Therefore, when considering the root cause, he is a pitiful person. And his current wrong behavior has planted a seed; what will be the result? His life will be very tragic, possibly even with an irredeemable future. Therefore, looking at it from his past causes, he is a pitiful person; and from his future results, he is also a pitiful person. Thus, the benevolent person has no enemies. There are absolutely no evil people in this world, only pitiful ones. Especially those of us engaged in education can see this clearly: the correct mindset needs to be conveyed through education. With good education, everyone can be taught well. But without good education, anyone is susceptible to rapid degeneration in this life. Thus, "the faults of others are also correct" – compassion and tolerance arise.

"My correctness is also wrong." We cannot become fixated on the words themselves, but must comprehend the principles behind them. Why? "My correctness," what is that? It is when one’s own heart feels that one is correct. When there is correctness, there is what? Wrongness. Right and wrong are in opposition, creating superiority and inferiority. I am high; others are low. And then? When superiority and inferiority are created, arrogance follows. So, where does the work of self-cultivation lie? In protecting this heart from greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt. Arrogance is very powerful.

Confucius reminds us that, “People all desire to be teachers,” showing how easily arrogance can arise. So, how do we counteract this arrogance? In fact, in our interactions, particularly when engaged in education, “the noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Way grows.” Whether it is our own studies or our work as educators, to succeed we must focus on the root. Like a tree, it must have deep roots to have flourishing branches. And what is the root for an educator? Mr. Zhang Fa, the Deputy Director of the Hainan Provincial Department of Justice, has a famous saying. I believe this saying will go down in Chinese history. Because the achievements of Hainan Province are currently the most successful example of traditional culture. And this example is not just applicable to prisons, but to any and all situations.

The first principle is that leaders take the lead. He, as the top leader, brought eight cadres, nine people in total, to attend a five-day class. They sat in the first row, a truly impressive sight. They were all military personnel, energetic and fully focused on the lectures. After the nine people returned, they took the lead in studying, using fifteen days to rotate all the police officers in Haikou City through training. Police officers need to educate inmates, but educators must first educate themselves. If we cannot educate ourselves well, how can we educate others? We must love ourselves to love others. “Those who wish to love others, must first love themselves; those who wish to help others, must first help themselves; those who wish to know others, must first know themselves.” These are all about focusing on the root.

And they advance step by step, from points, to lines, to surfaces. This is the principle of how things should be done. Nowadays, people like to be fast, they like a lot, they rush into things with unstable foundations, and then their energy is all over the place. In the end, good intentions are ruined. It’s a great pity. Our ancestors told us: “Do not desire speed, do not seek petty gains. Haste makes waste, and seeking petty gains will ruin great plans.” If you only care about the present, putting on a fancy show on the surface, you are certain to ruin major endeavors and cause misunderstandings about traditional culture. Therefore, we must proceed step by step, with a solid foundation: “When the melon is ripe, it will fall from the vine; when the water flows, a channel will be formed.” This is the correct attitude and method for doing things. So Hainan Province started with one prison area. The inmates in this area had a very different mental outlook and temperament compared to other places. Once results were seen and people had confidence, the approach was expanded to the entire prison, and after it was stable, the entire city of Haikou was brought on board. When Haikou City was stable, the entire Hainan Province was included. In this way, the entire province received education in ethics and morality. Many inmates changed their fates. Mr. Zhang Fa has performed a great meritorious service. He is sixty-five years old now, and I see him flying around like a whirlwind, giving over twenty speeches every month. But he is becoming more energetic with every speech, because he has great compassion and wants to benefit more people. He tirelessly forgets about himself and thus becomes healthier and healthier.

Good, we realize that the root lies in self-education, starting with the investigation of things. When things are investigated, knowledge will be extended. Then one’s intentions become sincere, one’s heart becomes upright, one’s character is cultivated, one’s family is managed, the state is governed, and the world will find peace. Our lives can indeed be like classic texts, generating the value of governing the state and bringing peace to the world. We invited Principal Lu Jie and Teacher Wang Qi to Malaysia to speak to over a thousand principals and teachers, all from Chinese-language elementary schools. Their influence benefited Chinese people around the globe. And during their sharing, there were several Malay principals present who started to implement the *Standards for Being a Good Student* in their own schools. They thus benefitted people of different countries, different ethnicities, and even different religions. Is this not the effect of governing the state and bringing peace to the world? As long as we have this aspiration, each of our lives can become like that described in the *Great Learning*, creating the value of self-cultivation, family management, state governance, and world peace.

Therefore, in learning, “the most important thing is to establish one’s aspirations.” First, we should establish the same aspirations as Confucius because Confucius is the best example in education. When introducing myself as a teacher at a school, I say “I work with Confucius,” and I am honored. However, in working alongside him, we must also be like Confucius and emulate him. During Confucius’s time, there was societal decay and a crisis of cultural transmission. Confucius was able to compile the *Book of Poetry*, the *Book of Documents*, establish ritual and music, clarify the Way of the *Yi Jing*, and write the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. It was through Confucius that the tradition of the Way was passed down. I ask, when comparing the crisis of cultural transmission today with that of Confucius’s time, which is more dangerous? Yes, it’s much more dangerous now. Should we not stand up? Yes, we should. I met a female principal of a junior high school. When she went on stage to encourage us, her first sentence caused the hair on my head to tingle. She is a true heroine. She said, "The more chaotic the society, the more we should stand up. There is nothing too difficult to do, only whether something should be done." This is a life of righteousness. If something should be done, we should do it even if the odds are stacked against us. If something should not be done, we should remain unmoved even if gold and silver mountains are before us.

Mr. Lin Zexu also faced a national crisis in his time. So many Chinese people were addicted to opium that the country was on the verge of collapse. At that time, he received orders from the emperor to go to Guangzhou to prohibit opium. At the time, countless people were making money from opium; there were millions of vested interest holders. When they knew that he was going to prohibit opium, there were many who wanted him dead. It was during this crisis that Lin Zexu uttered the famous words: "If it benefits the nation, I will risk my life; how could I avoid misfortune or seek good fortune?" He was not afraid to die if it would benefit his country and his people. Now, we are restoring ethics and morality, restoring Chinese culture, and we don’t have to risk our lives! How can we compare ourselves to them? We have no risk of losing our lives, yet if we don't do it, we are not worthy of facing the ancient sages. And perhaps there are descendants of Lin Zexu in the audience. I have heard that Lin Zexu's descendants do not smoke because their ancestor was the first person in the world to prohibit drugs. If his descendants smoke, they would tarnish the face of their ancestor.

Moreover, the descendants of Confucius and Mr. Fan Zhongyan are exceptionally talented. I have met several, and they all have excellent family educations. When Confucius was at a critical point in cultural transmission, he directly took on the responsibility, with courage and righteousness. And the accumulated merits that he had cultivated, “accumulated good deeds will always produce residual blessings.” His descendants have flourished for over two thousand years, now reaching eighty-plus generations. I remember when Ms. Ju Meixin hosted a course one year, four descendants of Confucius gathered together: the seventy-fourth generation, the seventy-fifth generation, the seventy-sixth generation, and the seventy-seventh generation. Interestingly, the seventy-fourth generation was the most senior but the youngest. The four of them took a picture in the entranceway. All four were very accomplished, some were entrepreneurs, some were government officials, and some were teachers. Confucius's descendants have done very well. This is due, firstly, to the blessings of Confucius’s virtue, and secondly, to Confucius’s exemplary conduct, which allowed them to lay a solid foundation for their family education from a young age. So, for over two thousand years they have continued to thrive.

The difficulties that Confucius faced were not as great as the ones we face today. Our situation now is much harder. Thus, when you can do what is difficult and endure what is difficult, your merits will be even greater. So, when you encounter great difficulties, not only should you not be sad, you should say, “Heaven has high expectations for me.” Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on someone, it will first test their mind with hardship, strain their muscles and bones, starve their bodies, empty them of their possessions, and frustrate all their plans. Through this, their hearts will be moved and their nature will be tempered, thereby increasing their capabilities." Through this, we are able to continuously improve and break through our limitations. This is the spirit of someone with lofty aspirations, someone who understands the Mandate of Heaven. These difficulties are all for refining ourselves, increasing our wisdom and virtue. Good, the greater the difficulty, the greater the merit. Fellow practitioners, your efforts to transmit this culture in this era will bless your descendants for at least the next two thousand five hundred years. After all, Confucius’s descendants have thrived for two thousand five hundred years.

We believe that in the near future, perhaps in fifty or one hundred years, your children will one day step up and say, “I am the child of the principal of such-and-such school. I deeply admire my father, who, in his time, implemented ethics and morality at the school, and promoted traditional culture from the school. I greatly admire my father, and I want to continue his family's path. I want to do the same.” When they step up and say, "I am the descendant of so-and-so," thunderous applause will immediately erupt from below. Then your life will not have been in vain. "Since ancient times, everyone will die, but we should leave behind a loyal heart to illuminate history."

My teachers often encouraged us, "Life is a brief journey, only a few decades. We cannot have come into this world in vain. We must do right by ourselves, do right by our family and ancestors, do right by our country, society, and people, and do right by all living beings.” Thus, we must do the most important thing, the most fundamental thing, in the world: education. Only by improving people's hearts can we truly solve problems. We must become the people most essential in the world, doing what others are unwilling to do. What are people unwilling to do? They are unwilling to put aside selfishness and dedicate their lives to sacrifice and contribution. This is what most people are not willing to do, but we are willing to do it so that we can benefit more students. With such a great mind, this life will not have been lived in vain.

After establishing lofty aspirations to benefit our country, our people, and the world, where do we start? We start with the investigation of things, with removing our bad habits. One serious habit we just mentioned is arrogance. I ask you, when do people become arrogant? For example, will someone who is beautiful become arrogant? Will someone with a good figure become arrogant? Will someone with a higher level of education become arrogant? Will someone who makes more money become arrogant? Will someone who wears brand-name clothing become arrogant? Have you seen that the moment people become unaware, arrogance can arise?

There was an inmate who had already been in prison for five years. One day, there was a new inmate who was going to share his cell. He was feeling especially energetic that day, someone was coming in! When the new inmate arrived, the first thing he said was, “I’m telling you, I've been here for five years.” Being there for five years should be a cause for shame, but he was arrogant. Thus, even wrong actions can be the source of arrogance. See? This is about external things, material things, that can make people arrogant. And even one’s experiences can make people arrogant. For example, during a conversation, someone might say, "How long have you been studying traditional culture?" "Two years." "Only two years? I've been studying for five years." Arrogance has already arisen. Or for example, let's say you meet a principal whose school has 300 students, and your school has 3,000 students. When you meet, you ask, “How many students do you have?” “Three hundred.” “Only 300? My school has 3,000!” Even three thousand students can make someone arrogant.

So, have you seen how people, with age and experience, if their hearts are not pure, if they feel they have something, that very “something” will generate arrogance? Complacency invites loss; humility brings benefit. The moment someone feels that they have something, the wisdom and experiences of others cannot enter. And furthermore, arrogance creates a lot of pressure wherever it goes, thus diminishing relationships with others. Zeng Guofan said, "A family is destroyed by extravagance; a person is destroyed by laziness"; someone who is annoying is ruined by arrogance. Wherever they go, they are not welcome.

Thus, to overcome the attitude of arrogance, one must have a high degree of awareness, otherwise we can become arrogant at any time. There was a man who heard that a certain Zen master had great virtue. In his heart, he thought he would go ask questions and stump him. This very thought is already disrespectful and arrogant. When he met the Zen master, the master was wise and immediately knew what was on his mind. The master did not speak to him, but began pouring him tea. After the cup was full, the master kept pouring, and the tea spilled all over the table. The man quickly said, “It’s full, it’s full, don’t pour anymore!” The master said, “Because it’s full, nothing more can be poured in. The mountains of pride make it hard for wisdom to enter.” When a person is arrogant, it's like a mountain blocking them, closing off their minds, making it impossible for the wisdom of sages to enter. Although we have been in education for many years, due to inadequate transmission of traditional culture in the past several generations, we must now cherish the teachings of our ancestors. We must begin as a respectful student and start anew. When we do so, every word from our ancestors will quickly enter our hearts, and we will benefit in our lives immediately. Then we will be able to benefit our teachers and our students.

How do we subdue this arrogance? We will discuss that further in the next class. Okay, thank you all!

**Lecture Two: Interpreting the Topic**

Respected leaders, esteemed principals, and fellow educators, good morning!

We just mentioned that if a person has lofty goals and wants to benefit the nation and the world, the first place to start is by reforming their own habits and desires. If we ourselves have bad tempers and are arrogant, and even our families don't agree with us, how can we possibly go on to benefit society, the nation, or the world?  "If one's family cannot be taught, it is impossible for that person to teach others." The *Great Learning* states this impossibility. However, if a person has managed their family well, "the superior man, without going beyond his family, completes his teachings in the state." This is because the relationship between husband and wife, and the children they have raised, are all outstanding.  Husband and wife are harmonious, and their home becomes a model for all people. Take King Wen of Zhou and his wife, Taisi, for example. They were the world’s model couple, and their children were all sages. Therefore, "managing the family" is very important.

I remember a friend telling me that when choosing a partner, one should avoid elementary school teachers. I asked, why? He said that because an elementary school teacher is the ultimate authority in the classroom; she’s like a king ruling the world.  She’s a teacher in school, and she remains a teacher when she returns home. In school, she manages children: “Stand still, don’t move!”  As a result, at home, she might say to her husband, “Stand still, don’t move!” Naturally, her husband wouldn’t be able to bear it. Therefore, in every experience and in every phase of life, people can develop attachments, greed, and arrogance.

For example, how good was today’s breakfast? What kind of attitude did we have while eating it? Gratitude has no side effects.  However, eating with greed does have side effects. Because after being greedy, one will start comparing. If there is one less dish tomorrow, then annoyance will arise: "Yesterday’s was better, today’s is less." Then comes the trouble, right? When people are greedy throughout their lives, troubles will arise. How much of our annoyance comes from comparing? "The previous class of students was so good, this class of students is so bad.”  They start comparing, and the troubles come. If you are full of your own troubles, how can you love others?  “One should dwell nowhere and awaken the mind.” This “dwelling nowhere” is the work of investigating things; putting down attachments, putting down arrogant habits, and dwelling nowhere. This "dwelling" means not being attached or discriminating, but instead, giving rise to a heart of benevolence and love for others.

I mentioned earlier how the experience of being a teacher might cause an elementary school teacher to develop an attachment, and at home, she still treats her husband as her student; naturally her husband can't bear it.  It is not just the identity of a teacher that can lead to attachment and even arrogance.  Does being a chairman of a board also lead to attachment and corruption? We once met a chairman from Northeastern China who made a lot of money, and his siblings also worked for him. However, on one New Year's Eve, he invited his siblings for a meal, and no one was willing to come because all he did when he spoke was scold people. He was so arrogant; no one could stand him. That was the year he began learning about traditional culture. As a result, he arranged a New Year's Eve dinner costing 10,000 yuan, and no one wanted to come. He lamented that he hadn't realized how arrogant he had been. He called his younger brother at the restaurant and apologized, saying he had been too arrogant.  His younger brother started crying on the other end of the line.  So, we come into this world pure and innocent; we shouldn't let the things we experience in life lead to attachment and pollute our pure hearts.

After this businessman started learning, he immediately put things into practice.  Northeasterners are rather straightforward.  It wasn’t easy.  He heard that he should practice filial piety.  When he got home, he prepared a basin of hot water and walked in front of his mother, "Mom, I'm going to wash your feet." His mother was so startled that she quickly turned ninety degrees and said a very classic line: "Oh dear, I wouldn't dare let the chairman wash my feet." This statement is very telling.  Who was the person in front of him? Not her son, but the chairman. He is the chairman in the office, and he is still the chairman at home. This shows the “dwelling” – dwelling in one's own identity. Gradually, he develops an air of importance, making people feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, he might not feel grateful to his own mother, and might instead think, “My mother and all these younger siblings rely on me and what I provide to have what they have today.”  When people feel they have something, feel that they have made many contributions, and keep those feelings in mind, then they develop expectations and arrogance. In fact, all that we do is what we ought to do; it's the right thing to do. Those are considerations based on self-interest.  Contributions made with an expectation of return are self-serving.  Contributions made without any keeping of records are moral and righteous.

May I ask the parents here, have you ever counted how many times you've cooked meals for your children? Have you kept track of how many times you've covered them with blankets? You haven’t, right? But may I ask, do you remember how much money you lent to your friends? Yes, you do. So, you see, there is a difference. There was a father, before he got married, when guests came to their house, a friend brought a baby. Unfortunately, the baby defecated on the floor of their study. After the friend cleaned it up and left, the father said that whenever he walked into the study, he felt like there was still a smell.  Then he had his own child, and his own child might have defecated in any corner of the house. He never felt like it stank.  One day, he had an "awakening".  It was all due to his own discriminating mind.  How could there be a stink?  Other people’s children’s waste stank, but his own children’s did not.  If we treat everyone as ourselves, then we wouldn't feel that stink anymore, would we?

There's a good story from Zen Buddhism. A group of people were discussing the Way when suddenly the wind caused the flag to flap. The first person said, "The flag is moving.” The second person said, "It’s not the flag, it’s the wind that’s moving.” The third person, the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, said, "It is not the wind nor the flag that is moving, it’s your own mind that's moving." Therefore, circumstances are neither good nor bad; good or bad comes from our own minds. Because of discrimination, attachment, and likes and dislikes, suffering arises. "Troubles arise from love and hate." The investigation of things should begin with eliminating the heart of love and hate.

Furthermore, this love and hate—when people truly love, it’s called greedy love, because love leads to demands, and when those demands aren’t met, love turns into hate. If we think about it, the people we hate in our lives are often the ones we once loved. Does that make sense? Yes. If a stranger walks by and scolds you, you might think, “Oh well, maybe they lost a lot of money in the stock market today and are in a bad mood. Never mind, don’t bother with them.” But when your significant other scolds you, you think, “I'll never be done with you!”  Clearly, it’s just a couple of words, so why the big difference?  It’s not the wind moving, nor is it the flag moving; it’s our own minds moving, giving rise to discrimination, attachment, love, and hate.  Therefore, suffering is not inflicted upon us by others; we create it ourselves.  Our ancestors, in their proverbs, want us to see through the truths of life.  “Bringing trouble upon oneself, reaping what one sows, digging one’s own grave, willing one’s own downfall, abandoning oneself”—well, you can think of the rest yourselves.  Given all this, it’s about transforming our own minds; only then will our lives be transformed. If we're not clear on all these proverbs, aren’t we wasting all the effort put forth by our ancestors, who listed so many for us so that we may awaken? In a flash of thought: "Seek more blessings on one’s own; Strive to improve oneself." Isn't it just a matter of one thought?

So today, by reflecting on these principles, we should find the real root of our troubles and suffering. It’s when the mind gives rise to attachment and arrogance that we suffer. "Love and hate arise from discrimination."  "The Great Way is not difficult," to enter the way of the sages is not that complicated.  “It is only avoiding discrimination” that is difficult. It's that we often have that inclination of choosing; the likes and dislikes, this one's good, that one's not, these feelings arise for people and things. “If one simply does not hate nor love, then everything will be crystal clear.”

There is a quote from the *Great Learning* that explains this well: “To like someone and know their shortcomings”; to like them, but still calmly see their flaws. “To dislike someone and know their merits”; to strongly dislike someone, yet be able to objectively view them and see their strengths.  "This is rare in the world." It is very difficult to do this. Furthermore, the human mind, for example, if you have a greedy love for someone, it will become increasingly serious; if you have dislike towards them, it will also have its effect.  As you start to dislike them, you will dislike them more and more, until you feel that they have no merit whatsoever, and are good for nothing. The mind becomes skewed, it becomes not upright, and one sees everything less and less clearly.

For example, if a mother is overly indulgent towards her child—"To like someone and know their shortcomings"—even if the child’s elementary or kindergarten teacher points out problems, the mother doesn’t care; she thinks her child is the best and can’t see his problems.  In the end, the child makes a terrible mistake. Many parents only recognize the severity when the police call and say their child committed a crime: "That can’t be my child.” “To like someone and know their shortcomings.”

And hatred can also escalate. For example, once in Zhuhai, during a discussion about the way husband and wife should treat each other, I said, "To only see the other’s strengths and not see their weaknesses is a guiding principle for couples to grow old together." Please remember this principle, okay? Only see the other person's strengths and not see their weaknesses, and I guarantee you will grow old together. Confucius also said that if you learn one thing, you should what? Understand three others. So, this saying is not just for the relationship between husband and wife; it applies to all five human relationships. Between father and son: See his strengths and encourage him. It is the same between friends; if you are a leader, see people’s strengths, encourage them, and tolerate their weaknesses, then the relationships will be very harmonious.

These ancient teachings about how to conduct oneself are universally applicable. Why? Because all people share the same mind, and the same principles apply. Learning the teachings of the sages is not the same as learning knowledge. With knowledge, you memorize and then are able to write. However, the teachings of the sages allow you to understand by analogy, and that is why they emphasize the importance of realization. “The learning of memorization is not sufficient for one to become a teacher.” “Reviewing the old and knowing the new, that is sufficient to become a teacher.” As one reviews the classics they once read, their level of understanding will have deepened as their state of mind elevates.  Therefore, that is the growth of their wisdom and realization. The goal of the sages' teachings is to help us become people of great wisdom, not simply people who are good at taking exams. We must gradually come to understand this.  Of course, with wisdom, one will certainly do better on exams. But what we should be focusing on is how our children should approach life and deal with things, because that will benefit them throughout their lives.

At that time in Zhuhai, after I shared this guiding principle, a lady in the audience suddenly got very agitated and stood up, replying, "There are no strengths!" I said, "Only see their strengths", and she said, "There are no strengths." So, I walked up to her and paid her my utmost respect, telling her, "Ma'am, if your husband has no strengths, yet you still dared to marry him, then you are truly a revolutionary martyr. I’ll go to hell so you don’t have to." You couldn't possibly have married him if he truly had no strengths. When you were dating, everything about him was like a beauty in the eyes of the beholder.  Why does the beauty in the eyes of the beholder become nothing?  Can you see that when people develop dislike, it gives rise to a chemical reaction? Yes. It expands and expands until in the end, nothing is good. It’s not that the other person has a problem, so who has the problem? We do.

In a later lecture, I once again mentioned this guiding principle.  A lady from Dalian, after hearing me, exclaimed to herself, "There are no strengths!"  After I told the Zhuhai story, she laughed.  That night, she went home and took a piece of paper, and wrote down her husband's strengths and weaknesses.  After calming down, she realized that she had listed quite a few strengths. She really only listed one weakness: He made too little money. That wasn’t really a weakness. You can see that a person's heart that is used to climbing and being vain, turns into only seeing their husband’s faults, and does not see the good in him.

Therefore, "to dislike someone and know their merits," we need to be able to look at people and things with a truly calm and peaceful heart. Otherwise, we will be blocked by our love and hate. When we put down the love and hate, many things will become more and more clear. Furthermore, it’s only when you truly understand yourself, that you can truly understand others. There was a teacher who was having a really tough time with his teaching. He had a student he really could not teach anymore, he couldn't muster any love for him, and he really wanted to give up.  Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. He asked himself: If the student in front of him was his own son, would he still teach him? That thought restored his mission and love for education, and he resumed patiently teaching the child. When one is truly sincere, even metal and stone can be moved. Gradually, the child changed. What seemed like the student’s problem turned out to be a problem with his own mind. Therefore, when we are free of these hates and loves, and are being sincere, then we can communicate with sincerity, and gradually our whole environment will begin to transform. When we are upright ourselves, then we can influence the people around us.

I just mentioned how to tame arrogance.  First, we need to take on a learning attitude: “Transmitting, not creating.” We must learn from Confucius. From today on, we should humbly learn from the ancient sages and put down our old, incorrect concepts. We should align with the sages' teachings and not our own troubles and habits. Only by putting down what should be put down can we pick up what should be picked up.  Otherwise, these incorrect thoughts and concepts will continue to obstruct our lives.  When we can do this, we are no longer arrogant but rather humble.

Actually, some people might feel after hearing all of this, why do I have to listen to the sages?  The teachings of the sages have been passed down for thousands of years, so why have they been able to last so long? They are truth. When you practice them yourself, you will realize that they are innate in your nature, and that the sages are not dragging you along. When you actually practice them, it becomes clear.  “Doing good is the greatest joy; Helping others is a joy.” When you actually do them, you will understand and experience it for yourself.  Including what Mencius said, “There are three joys in life: when both parents are alive, and our siblings are well,” this kind of family happiness is far greater than any pleasure from worldly desires.  Also, “To teach the talented individuals of the world, that is the second joy, and to have no shame when looking up to the heavens and down to people” are some of the joys in life.  When you have no shame when you look up and down, your conscience is very peaceful, and you can fall asleep within a minute or two.

I have a friend who is truly amazing. He is five years older than me. One day, we were lying in bed, and we were talking about our feelings. As we talked, he said, "Lixu, I’m going to sleep." I said, "Okay," and after that reply, he fell asleep and started snoring within about ten seconds. Wow, his mind had nothing bothering it; that is truly wonderful. The blessed ones are not necessarily those who are wealthy, because nowadays the more money you have, the more troubles you have; because they don't know which bank has higher interest rates, or which stocks to pick. They are exhausted. Those who are blessed are able to let go, they sleep well, and they enjoy their food; everything tastes delicious. People with many worries can't taste the food, even when they’re eating the best dishes. Once we were lying next to each other; and another time, we were on the phone, talking and talking, and suddenly, I could hear him snoring. He fell asleep while talking! The next day I told him that he fell asleep on the phone yesterday, and he said, “Really?” He totally forgot. So, to have nothing on your mind is a joy in this world. It's like that song says, "If there are no worries on your mind, then every moment is a good one." Right?

When we align with the teachings of the sages, we will benefit greatly. We will immediately understand and feel joy because we are operating our lives in accordance with the innate good conscience and abilities that we already have. In the beginning, the sages are leading us, but as you progress, it is your own true heart and innate virtue that will guide you. Today, people tend to be arrogant and unwilling to accept these truths. The ideas of many people today do not align with the classics, yet they are still included in textbooks. Therefore, the calamity we face today is that people aren’t listening to the teachings of the sages, and instead are accepting foolish ideas. This is a great misfortune for the world.

Once, Confucius was with his ruler, and the ruler asked him, "I have heard that building a house facing east is inauspicious?" Confucius told the ruler, "Building a house facing east is not inauspicious, but there are five things that are truly inauspicious.”  The Master's loyalty and love for the people is displayed in each of these opportunities. The ruler asked about building a house, but Confucius immediately turned that to how one governs the country and how one should love the people. Therefore, when we hear these stories, we must be able to feel the intentions of the ancient sages: "When admiring the virtuous, we should admire their hearts."

This is not only the case with Confucius, but also with Yan Ying from the Spring and Autumn period.  One day, his ruler went to the mountains and saw tigers, then went to a swampy area and saw snakes. When he returned, he was in a bad mood because he had seen both tigers and snakes, so he thought he was very unlucky. Yan Ying immediately seized the opportunity to say, "My lord, there are three inauspicious things for the country. Seeing tigers and snakes is not one of them."  Why did you see the tigers? Because that's where they live. How could that be inauspicious? Why did you see the snakes? Because that’s where they live. But there are three inauspicious things for the country. The first inauspicious thing is, having the talented and not recognizing them. The second is, knowing of the talented and not being able to employ them.  The third is, employing them but not trusting them.  For a country to flourish, the most crucial thing is to acquire the talent of virtuous sages; “When there are people, the government will be effective, but when people are gone, the government will cease to be.” In terms of schools, when a school has a few virtuous teachers, then it’s like the four pillars of a house are in place, and the school is very stable. But it is easy to find a thousand troops, and hard to find a general. How do we find a general? The *Book of Changes* tells us, "Things of a kind come together; things are grouped by their nature."  “If one has virtue, one will attract people.”  One must use their virtue to naturally attract good people.  The energy will reciprocate.  Therefore, Principal Lyu Jie encountered teacher Wang Qi; and Director Zhang Fa encountered a group of employees who were all filial sons. It is truly marvelous.  Once we sat together to chat and they were all filial sons. “Loyal ministers come from families of filial sons.” You can see that all these things confirm what the ancestors have said.

Confucius seized this opportunity and gave the ruler the most important wisdom for governing the country, telling him the five inauspicious things: First: "To harm others for one's own benefit is inauspicious for oneself." “To abandon the old and favor the young is inauspicious for the family.” “To dismiss the virtuous and employ the unworthy is inauspicious for the state.” “When the old are not taught and the young are not learning, it is inauspicious for the society.” “When the sages are in hiding and the foolish usurp power, it is inauspicious for the world.” In one statement, the Master addressed all the problems, from oneself to the family, the state, and the world. Therefore, it is wonderful to have wisdom; one statement can penetrate all the problems.

From the perspective of oneself: If a person is always harming others and trying to benefit themselves, then this person loses their blessings. What do blessings depend on? Cultivating the mind. If a person is always plotting to harm others, then they are using up all their blessings. So the ancestors said, “To hit others is to hit oneself, and to scold others is to scold oneself.” “That which proceeds from you will return to you.” If you hit someone today, they will remember it in their heart. “A gentleman takes revenge even after ten years,” and sooner or later they will come back for revenge. So, a wise person is clear that to hit others will ultimately be to hit oneself. “Words that go against morality will return as actions against yourself.” The *Great Learning* also reminds us of this truth. If we think about it, to benefit others is to first benefit ourselves: When your heart is full of goodness, then your mind and body are very healthy. Second, when you do good deeds, then you are planting good seeds, good actions lead to good results, and blessings will surely manifest in the future. Therefore, the idea that “To harm others for one’s own benefit” is a very incorrect value. But if we do not understand these principles, we may very well be teaching our children to be selfish and self-serving.

There was a father who taught at a school, and he was also in the field of education. However, his life philosophy was not necessarily correct; only when we study the classics, and align with the classics can we be sure of the truth. His child was in first grade at the same school. The child knew that his father was an administrator, and therefore, worked later hours. So, the child took the initiative to help the teachers and classmates.  Every day, he was the last to leave the classroom and always ensured that all the doors and windows were closed. That child was very simple; he enjoyed serving others, and every day, after checking the classroom, he would happily skip over to meet his father and go home.


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, keeping in mind the nuances of the original and aiming for a professional and readable result:

**Translation:**

It turned out that one day, he became like that too. But when he went into the office and saw his father, his father said to him, “Why are you so foolish? You’re always the one doing it, so you’re always at a disadvantage!” Wow, the child was stunned. Because his father spoke to him this way, and he respected his father, he accepted it and stopped doing it from that day on. Therefore, the thoughts and beliefs of parents and teachers influence a child for a lifetime. When he was one or two years old, it was "my dad says" and "my mom says." When he started first grade, it was "our teacher says." So the impact of parents and teachers on him throughout his life is enormous.

From that day on, not only did he stop proactively serving others, but he also became very calculating, slowly turning harsh and mean-spirited. In the fourth grade, his classmate’s father passed away. Not only did he show no sympathy, but he also mocked the boy for being a child without a father. The classmate cried heartbrokenly. Not many years after scolding his classmate, his own home was robbed. His father, who had a bad temper, chased after the thief relentlessly, cornering him in a dead-end alley. In a desperate situation, the thief pulled out a knife and stabbed his father, hitting his heart, and killing him on the spot. Just two years prior, this man’s child was laughing at someone who didn’t have a father, and before long, he himself became fatherless. Therefore, harshness, or “thinness” (薄, b薄), leads to a lack of blessings (福, fú). A child who was originally so happy to help others, someone who had good fortune, became calculating and narrow-minded because of his father’s misguided guidance. He ended up without blessings, and even harmed others. This is a “disaster for the body,” and his family also lost their good fortune. And this story was something he proactively came back to tell his middle school teacher. That act was also his kindness, hoping others would not repeat these mistakes. If a student thinks about others from a young age, this child will inevitably have good fortune in their life. You don't need to worry about them. Wherever they go, “Those who love others are always loved; those who respect others are always respected.”

“Discard the old to favor the young” – only caring about children and ignoring the elderly – is a “disaster for the family.” Nowadays, the world doesn’t emphasize filial piety. The elderly are pitiful, living in nursing homes, while children are increasingly arrogant, becoming little emperors and empresses. Furthermore, without the transmission of filial piety, this family will surely decline. Therefore, such a family is inauspicious. What is very precious is that China has emphasized filial piety through the "Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly," requiring children to fulfill their filial duties. No other country in the world has such legislation. From these signs, it can be seen that the 21st century is the century of the Chinese people. Without emphasizing filial piety, the whole of humanity has no future. Why? Because filial piety is the origin of love. If people don't know how to love others, how can they possibly have a happy life? How can humanity have a future? However, the origin of love is filial piety, which is the root and foundation of virtue. Filial piety is the foremost of all good deeds. Without filial piety, the family will fall into ruin.

“Dismiss the virtuous and appoint the unworthy” – abandoning those with virtue and instead using those who flatter and bootlick – is inauspicious for a group or a country, it’s a “disaster for the nation.” Actually, it reflects a leader who likes to hear pleasant words and dislikes hearing honest advice, leading them to dismiss the virtuous and appoint the unworthy. Therefore, every sentence in the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (*Dizi Gui*) is closely related to whether a person can achieve success in life. The *Dizi Gui* says, “When praised, fear it” – when you hear praise, be in trepidation, thinking, “It's thanks to everyone’s efforts, not my own.”; “When faults are pointed out, rejoice” – when others point out our mistakes, be very happy, “Thank you, you are my benefactor, otherwise, if I, as the principal, made the wrong decision, many students would be harmed. I thank you, I am grateful for your reminder.”

"Honest advice is hard to take but beneficial to action; good medicine is bitter to the taste but beneficial to curing disease." Throughout the thousands of years of history, sages and virtuous people have always had ministers or even their closest family members give them reminders so that they could achieve their Daoist cultivation or their accomplishments. For example, Emperor Taizong of Tang was great, but who did he have by his side? Besides Wei Zheng, he also had someone even more important, Empress Zhangsun. Without Empress Zhangsun, three or five Wei Zhengs may not have been enough to prevent his downfall. Once, he was so angry that he couldn’t control himself. Empress Zhangsun, very clever and perceptive, noticed this, quickly changed into the clothes worn for the highest national celebrations, dressed very regally, and walked in front of Emperor Taizong. Emperor Taizong, who was fuming, was confused seeing her in such attire. "What are you doing?" The Empress said, "Congratulations, Your Majesty! Congratulations, Your Majesty! That there is such an honest and outspoken minister, it is only because a wise ruler has appeared that such loyal ministers exist.” Upon hearing this, Emperor Taizong thought, "Ah, I am a wise ruler," and his anger dissipated.

Therefore, everyone must understand that to achieve any great accomplishment, there are many unseen key figures providing reminders. It is difficult to achieve something significant. In today's world, if you do good things, people doubt you; if you do bad things, people think it’s normal. Because we have these experiences, within a group, we should endure hardship and be responsible, prioritizing the overall situation, and never cause trouble for important educational endeavors. So, we must not lose our temper, and even when others lose their temper at us, we must be tolerant.

"Undertake tasks that are difficult to accomplish, with strength but without anger; deal with difficult people, with understanding but without words." Since something is difficult to accomplish, but it is still important, then of course we should have the "strength" - which means take the initiative to bear the burden and lead the trend, but we cannot have a temper. Even when you've done a lot, you can’t lose it and say, "I've done so much, and you still don't understand me!" Wow, all your previous efforts will be ruined, like a fire burning down the forest of merit. “A single thought of anger arises, and a million obstacles open” - it burns down the forest of merit. And losing your temper really does risk ruining everything you've done. Therefore, be patient, everything is achieved through patience. You must bear hardship and responsibility. “Dealing with difficult people” – sometimes, these key people have bad personalities and tempers. At these times, you must have the wisdom to remind them with skillful and convenient methods. You see, these sages had to use skillful and convenient reminders when facing emperors, who had great power and even big tempers. This is all due to wisdom. Look at how Yan Ying’s reminders were full of wisdom, even using historical stories as reminders. So, we should have more knowledge in our minds. When an issue comes up, think about which story from the Spring and Autumn Period or which person from the Song Dynasty was very generous, like Wang Dan, a prime minister known for his tolerance. Tell them stories like these, which they will find more engaging. You must have wisdom and gradually remind them and help them. But do not speak angrily, and do not speak critically. If you say, "I've been so good to them, but they still won't listen," this will cause a rift if those words reach their ears. You must be “without words,” you must endure, and don't complain.

So, people in a group or a family must remember to "not speak of family scandals." Everyone must calmly think about why you need to remain calm. Because people tend to be emotional, they do things they regret. But, there is no medicine for regret in this world. Calmly reflect, and many principles will become clear. What good can someone gain by revealing their family scandals? It’s only a temporary venting of anger, and in the end, it will lead others to look down upon them. Has anyone ever been respected for criticizing their own father? Has anyone ever been respected for criticizing their own partner? It is a joke to others, isn't it? Isn’t it self-humiliation? So, when someone criticizes their own group, how can they expect to be affirmed and praised? It is impossible. Why? Because we have lost our foundation. We have a moral obligation to our family and group. When family members are wrong, "gently advise, virtue is established; without correcting missteps, both paths are lost." When they are wrong, I have also failed in my own duty.

And now, let's do a practice. When a person speaks ill of their partner, a family scandal is revealed, and eventually, these harsh words reach the partner’s ears. Wouldn't that deepen the rift between the two, leading to discord? So, instead of speaking of family scandals, what should we do? Speak of their strengths, not their weaknesses, and praise them. When your husband hears you praising him, from other people, he will hear it himself. He will think, “I have so many flaws, but my wife is so understanding and doesn’t mention them. I only have so few good qualities, and she still praises me everywhere.” Then, the husband will be very moved. “I can’t let my wife’s appreciation and trust down.” This gradually provides him the motivation to improve himself and change his ways. This is how married couples, by not speaking of family scandals, can encourage each other, leading things toward improvement.

When people are not calm and speak out of anger, things tend to go from bad to worse. This also applies to relationships between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. If mothers-in-law speak well of their daughters-in-law, the daughters-in-law will be moved. If daughters-in-law speak well of their mothers-in-law, the mothers-in-law will be happy. Then, praising each other and loving each other, wouldn't the mother-in-law gain another daughter? Wouldn't the daughter-in-law gain another mother? Isn't that a wonderful thing? But if the mother-in-law speaks ill of the daughter-in-law, there's a saying, "The mother-in-law carries a drum, talking about her daughter-in-law everywhere; the daughter-in-law carries a gong, talking about her mother-in-law everywhere.” Wouldn't things get worse and worse, and wouldn't the problems in the family never end? "Heaven's time is not as good as Earth's advantage; Earth's advantage is not as good as human harmony." These sayings all remind us how to be more tolerant and united, which is key to whether a group can achieve great success.

Today we discussed the issue of “dismissing the virtuous and appointing the unworthy.” Leaders must learn to use upright people, not just those who are obedient. Of course, if they are obedient, they must do the right thing. If they obey you even when you are wrong, then that is not right. Upright people have no selfish desires, and they are doing things for your benefit and the group’s benefit. But sometimes they are a little blunt, so you have to be able to tolerate them. At this time, you must learn from Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. Before he met Yang Guifei, he was no simple person, creating the “Kaiyuan Reign” of prosperity. At that time, he had loyal ministers like Han Xiu and Zhang Jiuling by his side. So, whether you have loyal ministers by your side is very important.

Emperor Xuanzong had Han Xiu by his side, and Han Xiu was always providing honest advice. Once, he was enjoying himself, when he suddenly became alarmed, "Ah, I'm playing here, does Han Xiu know?" Not long after he said this, a report came: Han Xiu’s memorial was presented. He read it, trembling, as he was criticized once again. This situation happened several times. The courtiers began to slander Han Xiu, "Your Majesty, look, it’s Han Xiu who's harming you, making you lose weight." How did Emperor Xuanzong respond? He said, "Every time Han Xiu speaks with me, or I read his memorials, I feel uncomfortable, but when I calm down and think about it, even though I feel uncomfortable, it's beneficial for the people, so I lose weight alone, and the whole country gains, which is valuable. You all speak pleasant words, and I feel exhilarated, but after that, when I think about it, it is not right, it doesn't benefit the common people." So, he was still very clear-headed.

But later, he met Yang Guifei, and the temptation was too much to resist. "From then on, the monarch did not hold court in the mornings." Therefore, one's cultivation should be improved quickly, to reach the point of unwavering stillness. No matter the temptation, you must be able to, "Be unmoved by wealth and glory, unyielding to poverty and lowliness, and unbending to force and power." You must quickly adjust yourself to that state, otherwise, a single misstep can lead to eternal regret. You see, meeting Yang Guifei ruined him. He nearly destroyed the Tang Dynasty, luckily there were still loyal ministers like Guo Ziyi who were able to save it.

Therefore, is the process of investigation of things important? Yes, it is. You must be able to resist the temptations of wealth, lust, fame, and food. I think, if Yang Guifei had met Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, or Yu the Great, she would certainly have been assigned to clean the toilets. These sagely kings were very perceptive. For example, Yu the Great, when he tasted the wine sent to him by the barbarians, immediately said, "This type of wine must be destroyed. In the future, someone will certainly destroy their country by drinking it." His ability to discern the small details was extremely strong. The more perceptive a principal or a leader is, the better they can prevent problems from occurring. Their students will greatly benefit, and they will be able to "stop things before they even begin." Nowadays, education is all about adjusting things only after problems have already occurred, fixing things when it’s already too late, and it’s exhausting.

"The old do not teach, the young do not learn, customs are inauspicious" – the older generation does not focus on educating the next generation, and the next generation does not learn, leading to the rapid decline of customs. We see that the relationships between young men and women are in chaos, but I once heard an elder say, "Young people have their own ideas, and we can’t control them anymore." Upon hearing this, I immediately reminded him, "Don't say this to anyone else, or you will be responsible for very serious consequences. You are misguiding all elders and causing them to forget their responsibilities." What should parents and elders do? Your words and actions must be a good example for your children. You must have that sense of responsibility. And you must teach them as early as possible, starting with prenatal education, starting from a young age. It is more difficult to teach them when they are older, but at least you've started, so it is not too late. Actually, children can be taught.

I once went to a university in 2005, and for nearly a year I taught traditional culture. It was shocking. At the China University of Geosciences, I gave a 12-hour lecture. Eight or nine hundred students listened with complete concentration. It's not that they don't want to learn, it's that we haven't taught them. At that time, the children's focus was astonishing. I felt that in the gap between one sentence and the next, in less than a second, they would look at the stage with bright, attentive eyes. I thought that you could hear a pin drop. Their thirst for knowledge made us feel both moved and regretful. What did we regret? Why did we only teach them these things when they were already in university?

Moreover, I taught at their school for a semester. During that time, a teacher came to me and said, "Providing university students with correct thoughts and beliefs and a traditional cultural education is very urgent." Because, a short while ago, they had invited a successful person (this successful person made a lot of money) to give a lecture to the students. The speaker stood on the stage and said to the students, “Everyone, if you want to succeed today, the first thing you must do is drop the concept of morality. As long as you don’t murder, commit arson, or break the law, you can do anything.” This female teacher was sitting below, breaking out in a cold sweat. But what was even more shocking to her, was that after this person said this, there was a huge round of applause. Do you think those children were misled by that applause? I felt heartbroken when I heard that. So wherever I go, I advocate for the study of traditional culture and encourage everyone to go to universities to guide children with the right thoughts and beliefs.

Everyone has a responsibility. In the past, it wasn't just parents and elders who had this responsibility. What was the social custom in the past? When you saw a child doing something wrong on the street, knowing they would be the future leaders of our society, you would take the initiative to remind them and teach them. I had that experience when I was little. My parents and elders were not around, but when I did something wrong, a stranger, an elder, would say, "Little one, you can't do that." I would feel embarrassed. "How could you be so poorly raised?" And I would stop doing it. When I was corrected by an unfamiliar elder, my parents, when they found out, would go and thank that elder. Nowadays, people do not have this mindset. If a stranger reminds their child of something, the parents will say, "It's none of your business!" They don't have this good attitude anymore. Therefore, realistically speaking, it's not that children are difficult to teach, but who is even more difficult to teach? It's the adults. If a school is to promote ethics, morality, and virtue education well, they must often hold courses for parents. Otherwise, if the parents' views are different from those of the teachers and the classics, it will cause conflict, and the effect will not be good. Therefore, the responsibility of education is great. Because we understand education, the average person doesn't. You must see good deeds through to the end. If you truly want to teach children well, you must also frequently provide courses in virtue education for their parents. Places like the Songhua River Middle School are actively doing this.

"The sages are hidden, and the foolish usurp power" – the teachings of the sages are no longer believed, and the foolish, instead, have seized power. Even their ideas have been included in university textbooks, which is "inauspicious for the world." I'll give you an example. Someone who once won the Nobel Prize said, "The only goal of a business: is to make a profit.” This sentence has even been included in textbooks. When the foolish usurp power, and even win the Nobel Prize, those who judged his worthiness for the Nobel Prize must take responsibility, right? Yes, really. Our ancestors clearly understood that everything we do has an impact, and we must act cautiously. In ancient times, if parents raised a central government official, the state would hold a memorial for the official’s parents every year, using the rituals of a central government minister, because they were thinking of the parents who raised a pillar of the nation. Never forgetting one’s roots, never forgetting the cause, our ancestors were always so kind, remembering the source of the water when drinking it. This is how we should do good deeds. When you do bad deeds, you will be responsible for the consequences. Whoever is misled by such wrong ideas must bear the responsibility. Moreover, when you include this in university textbooks, you have committed a huge crime. Therefore, our ancestors told us to “be careful in speech and conduct,” you can’t speak carelessly.

And, if this sentence were said in ancient Chinese society, people would have spat at it. "The only goal is to make a profit?” How petty! Confucius told us, “A gentleman understands what is right, a petty person understands what is profitable.” “A gentleman loves wealth but obtains it in a proper way.” Take for example, the very successful merchant groups from ancient China, the Shanxi merchants, Anhui merchants, and Zhejiang merchants. What did they always uphold? Profit comes from righteousness. Where does profit come from? From serving with integrity and fulfilling your duty. "Profit arises from righteousness, wealth arises from the Dao." Wealth must correspond to righteousness, and that is the correct way to obtain wealth; if wealth does not correspond to righteousness, it is ill-gotten wealth, and acquiring ill-gotten wealth will bring misfortune. How could they say it is the "only goal?" Isn’t that a profit-seeking mindset? Isn’t that the way of a petty person? How many people were misled by that? And you see, this sentence has been passed down in universities for so long, and the damage to nature caused by the entire business world has been unprecedentedly severe. If you want to restore nature to its original state now, even if you used all the money you earned to do so, it may not even be enough. It is all caused by short-sighted self-interest, which has caused serious harm to themselves and their descendants. So, you can see how terrible it is when foolish people seize power.

Many people with lofty ideals want to improve the environment and leave a better living space for future generations. They are trying to understand the situation with soil pollution. It turns out, that if you really want to do good things, it is very challenging. When they go to learn about the soil, they find that it has been polluted by pesticides and fertilizers. How can they improve the soil? Once they begin this journey, they realize that the water is polluted, and the air is polluted. It’s not a single problem, it's a global problem, so this is a massive task. We people of this generation bear a lot of responsibility. One day, I saw a piece of calligraphy written by an elder, "If the rivers run dry, how can we face our descendants?" If the rivers run dry, the next generation will have no way to survive. How can we face our descendants? "If the culture is lost," if the Chinese culture is lost at our hands, "how can we face our ancestors?" Five thousand years of culture ending with us. We will have no face to see our ancestors. Therefore, we in this generation must bear the responsibility of inheriting the past and blazing a trail for the future.

Comparing everything to the classics, we will be able to distinguish what is correct and what is wrong. A gentleman thinks about their duty and where their righteousness lies, while petty people only think about their own self-interest. It happened that one year, I met a Malaysian PhD, Dr. Ariffin, in Lujiang. He sat right in front of me. Before we even began eating, he asked me his first question, "Do you know about Confucius's 'Famine at Chen and Cai?'" At that time, I felt a cold sweat run down my back. Why? Because a foreigner’s first question was about Confucius’s "Famine at Chen and Cai." I felt challenged. Luckily, I knew about it, otherwise, I would not have known what to do with myself. I thought about how I had once heard that when Chinese people went to the U.S. or the U.K., people would ask them, "Have you read the *Analects*?" "No." "Have you read the *Tao Te Ching*?" "No." "Have you read the *I Ching*?" "No." After so many "no's," they would just walk away. They would be very surprised. Why don't the Chinese read the most important classics of their own ancestors? They had lost face abroad. So, when he asked this, I thought, if I didn't know about it, I would have been so embarrassed. So I discussed the "Famine at Chen and Cai" with him.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and keeping a tone suitable for a book:

**Translation:**

It turns out, this particular doctor, when we went to Malaysia, delivered a lecture titled "The Relationship Between Confucian Thought and Islam," which was very scholarly. At that time, UNESCO had sent a set of school materials for use in Malaysia. The Malaysian government then gave this book to Dr. Ariffin, asking him, "Please review this book and see if it's suitable for implementation in schools." After his review, he returned it to UNESCO. When they asked him why he had sent it back, he said, "This book doesn't even contain Confucian thought; it's unqualified. I'm returning it." You see, even a Malaysian doctor knows to check for alignment with Confucian thought to determine if something conforms to truth and standards.

Therefore, today we must subdue our arrogance. As we were discussing earlier, adopt an attitude of "narrating, not creating," and be able to follow the teachings of the sages, just like this doctor. And our attitude when listening to lectures or reading the classics should be that every sentence is about oneself, not others. If this attitude is not established, arrogance will be difficult to control, because "everyone likes to be a teacher." Some people who study traditional culture have said that they find it difficult to get along with others in that community. Why is it difficult? They’ve discovered that everyone is learning, and one doesn’t become a Confucius in three or five days. However, in the learning process, one may have sudden enlightenment on principles, but must gradually correct one’s actions. Yet, after understanding the principles, if one does not work on oneself inwardly, the first impulse is to see others' faults. Thus, arrogance arises. When they interact with others, instead of benefiting from traditional culture, people feel pressured. It creates a counterproductive and negative effect. So, this arrogance must be subdued, but without a high degree of vigilance, it is very easy to fall victim to it.

I remember an elderly person who read the manuscript of the forty-lecture series, “A Happy Life,” countless times. His copy of the book was tattered and worn with many pages falling out. I was impressed by his diligent study. However, when I opened his book, I found that after each principle was explained, he had added annotations: "Son needs to see this," "Wife needs to see this," "Younger brother needs to see this." By the end of the book, everyone should read and learn, except for him, himself. He ended up seeing the shortcomings of everyone around him through the lens of the classics, making it difficult for others to accept him. The teachings of the sages teach us to “correct oneself and not seek it from others.” This is what Confucius taught in the *Analects*: do not crave or criticize others, "then there will be no resentment." And if there are still unpleasant situations with family and friends? Not only should we not criticize or demand, but we should also do what? “When actions are not as they should be, turn inward to find the cause.” We must not learn traditional culture the wrong way around. We should “be strict with ourselves and lenient with others.” Being strict with oneself is "loyalty," reflecting on one's own actions; being lenient with others is "forbearance." These words embody the Way of Loyalty and Forbearance. People focus their energy on observing others, leaving little time to observe themselves. "Those who are good at discussing others” only criticize, "will necessarily neglect themselves.” Their energy and effort are rarely focused on their own behavior.

Furthermore, today if we are a leader, or a communicator sharing traditional culture on a platform, or even just introducing traditional culture to others in personal interactions, in fact, everyone should have such a role and opportunity. At these times, when we speak to others, we should not feel superior or consider ourselves as teachers. Rather, when we speak, who should we be advising? We should be advising ourselves. When teaching or speaking, our attitude should be that we are advising ourselves. Everyone is a teacher, and we are students, reporting our insights to them; or when you present your doctoral or master's thesis, they are there to listen and evaluate. This way, we will not develop arrogance. Otherwise, when one is speaking on a platform or sharing with others, one might gradually feel superior and more capable than others, which is not good. As the saying goes, "Old Wang sells melons and praises his own." I have also seen some senior figures in education who immediately say, "Ah, I have taught for over twenty years; when I was teaching, you didn't even know where you were!" This kind of attitude easily fuels arrogance. So, when we are teaching or speaking, we are advising ourselves, which makes it less likely for arrogance to arise.

Moreover, there is a great benefit to engaging in education. For instance, when I explain these classic principles to sixth-grade children, after I've spoken, I must be the first to put them into practice. For example, if I say, "When speaking, sincerity should come first," but then fail to fulfill promises to my students a few days later, they will lose faith in me, and they will not believe in the classics either. Therefore, we must strive to live the principles we teach even before our students do. This creates immense pressure to better oneself, leaving no path of retreat. Since I’ve already spoken so much, if I do not put them into practice myself, I will not inspire faith in others and will tarnish the reputation of our ancestors. It’s a case of burning the boats – no path for retreat, only forward progress.

Furthermore, we should consider ourselves students, and all people and events as teachers, reminding us, when I face this person, am I still having emotional reactions? Do I still have attachments and desires? They are reminding me that I still have these habits inside me, which I must quickly let go. They are all teachers coming to help me to improve. Then a person will not become arrogant.

Also, we should "compare our virtue with those above us" to avoid arrogance. Comparing our conduct with the sages will cause us to "know shame," and will prevent arrogance. Today, if we learn a little and then compare ourselves with Zhang San and Li Si, we become arrogant. When people advise us, we think, "I'm much better than them; why are you still criticizing me?" By comparing ourselves with those below, we fail to admit our faults and become arrogant. But if we "compare our virtue with those above," if "learning Confucianism means learning from Confucius," a teaching from my mentor that I find very useful: from now on, in every word, action, thought, and intention, who should we take as our standard? Confucius, he is the best role model in education, the Sage Master. "Studying the Dao means learning from Lao Tzu, and studying Buddhism means learning from Sakyamuni Buddha." These are the sages of the three major teachings: Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. If we compare ourselves to these sages, we will often see our own shortcomings. How can we become arrogant? When we are always observing our own minds, we are subduing our habits. This is the work of “investigating things.”

Today, we are exploring this together and also setting our aspirations together to be mentors for life to children. If we all share this intention, the power of two united minds can break gold, let alone the immense power we have with so many colleagues in the field of education. And the spirit of intellectuals must be revived. On January 1, 2008, New Year's Day, Principal Lu Jie was in Lujiang, where many business owners were in attendance. He went up on stage and said, "We must do our best to promote Chinese culture!" Principal Lu Jie was moved to say, "Businessmen and entrepreneurs have such a sense of national mission. As the principal of an educational institution, I feel deeply ashamed. If I do not share their heart, then we as intellectuals are losing face."

And when we decide to “be mentors for life to children,” when should we start? We should start right now. Start this very moment. How should we begin? Start with the fundamentals. What are the fundamentals? Leading by example is fundamental, investigating things is fundamental, changing our habits is fundamental, starting with filial piety is fundamental, and beginning with virtuous conduct is fundamental. As the saying goes, "The noble person focuses on the fundamentals; when the fundamentals are established, the Way will emerge." We should start by returning to being students and starting from zero, remembering the kindness of our ancestors and sages. What level of accomplishment is required to become a mentor for life to a child? In reality, doing our best sincerely is what makes it complete, rather than needing to reach some specific level to be truly doing it. Because every sincere effort will move the hearts of teachers and children. I remember my junior high school principal. He loved the school deeply. When I went to the school to exercise on Sunday, I saw him walking around the campus, picking up litter. His dedication deeply moved me. From then on, we all voluntarily picked up litter and also loved our own school. Therefore, genuine expression at this moment is itself complete.

Old man Bai Fangli is an exemplary model of volunteerism, and he devoted himself entirely to the education of the next generation. He traveled eighteen times around the equator, earning over 300,000 yuan, which he donated all to children. Hundreds of university students received assistance from him. When we think calmly about his circumstances, what were they? He had no status, no wealth. When he was over seventy, he saw that children in his hometown were not able to go to school. He donated his entire life savings of 5,000 yuan. He had no money; every day he earned a few dozen yuan, saved it, and then donated it. He was poorer than any of us, and his physical strength was also weaker than most of us, yet he dedicated his all to the next generation, to the nation. How many people were touched by him? Even with his limited conditions, he was able to make such a sacrifice and contribution. How can we stand by and do nothing?

The government promotes moral exemplars, which are all in line with the teachings of Confucius. "Praising good deeds is a form of teaching." By showcasing these good deeds, we can move people to emulate them. For instance, in 2011, in Hangzhou, there was Ms. Wu Juping, who happened to see a child in her community falling from the tenth floor. Without any hesitation, she rushed to catch her, and her own arm was fractured into many pieces. A statue of her holding the child was erected in the Hangzhou People's Square, becoming the spirit of Hangzhou. On the internet, she declared, “We refuse to stand idly by.”

Mr. Bai Fangli and Ms. Wu saw the needs of society and felt that this was a moral obligation that they should fulfill. They refused to stand idly by. With this mindset, they surely moved the people around them. In my experience working in education, many teachers cherish the students they taught in the first, second, and third years the most. It is strange, because in the first, second, and third years, they should have the least teaching ability and experience. But why are those years the most memorable for the students? Because the teachers were most dedicated. Therefore, dedication in the moment is what makes it complete; it is not about needing to meet very high standards. We should do everything with our true hearts; that is the right path.

Therefore, when we say “be mentors for life to children,” this refers to our own children, our students at school, and the next generation of our nation. If our school does well, then we can share our valuable experience with other regions and benefit all of China’s children. Furthermore, the 21st century is the century of the Chinese people. If the Chinese people recover their ethics and morals, and recover their sense of filial piety, then the world will emulate them, and the next generation of children will be saved. The future of all children in the world is closely related to the development of China. “Be mentors for life to children”—this “children” also refers to the children of the world.

Why is a person considered “noble”? It is because of their intentions, of always thinking about the lifelong happiness of their students. People are noble because of their intentions and their actions, not their position. A high position without care for people and without working for their wellbeing will result in them being looked down upon. Every position is based on the trust of the people. Trust, duty – when we have that sense of responsibility, when we are wholeheartedly committed to the lifelong happiness of children, then we become noble individuals. And since it is about the lifelong development of these children, we need to think about their lifelong achievement in their studies, career, family, and the right attitudes they need in life. If, in elementary and middle school, we instill these most important principles for life and for conduct deeply within them, then they will have a happy life.

As for what ideas and concepts can bring lifelong happiness, we will discuss them in future lectures. For instance, the attitude of gratitude and repaying kindness brings happiness, while the attitude of ingratitude and betrayal brings pain and misfortune. For example, diligence and frugality are key for managing a household and cultivating oneself, but laziness and extravagance ruin lives. For instance, contentment brings happiness, while greed brings suffering. Humility brings benefit, while arrogance and complacency bring loss: "Complacency invites loss, while humility brings benefit.” In fact, with these attitudes, even if a person has high levels of education and wealth, they will ultimately still be unhappy if they don’t understand these principles for life.

That is all I will share for today’s lecture. Thank you all.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for clarity and accuracy while maintaining a professional tone:

**Lecture Three: The Meaning of Life**

Esteemed leaders, esteemed principals, fellow educators, good morning!

It's summer vacation now, and thinking back to the days of leading a class at school, I yearned for the arrival of summer break. My physical and mental state was just stretched to the limit, and I thought, "Wow, finally vacation! I can finally relax and recuperate." To see all of you principals and fellow educators, setting aside your rest time to come to our Jumeixin Center and delve into the educational philosophies and wisdom of traditional culture, fills me with great admiration. Indeed, unless you are in the thick of it, on the front lines of education, it's hard to understand the hardships of an educator. As the saying goes, "You don’t know the difficulty until you experience it." Before I entered the field of education, I always thought teachers had it easy, with summer and winter breaks. It's hard to get an accurate picture when you're on the outside looking in. My mother is an elementary school teacher, my uncle is a junior high teacher, my aunt is also an elementary school teacher, my other aunt is an elementary school teacher, my older sister is a university professor, my cousin and his wife are both elementary school teachers... I'll stop there for now. So while I appear familiar with the education industry, not having been directly involved, it’s still difficult to understand the hardships and joys it encompasses.

Yesterday, we spoke about how one should not be arrogant. When does a person become arrogant? It's when they see something and immediately make a judgment. This becomes dogmatic, and dogmatism is arrogance. This dogmatism is very likely to cause misunderstandings, and it may prevent you from understanding others' hardships. It can even lead to criticism, and after being dogmatic and critical of others, you may cause them to misunderstand you or lose confidence.

So if a person does not subdue this arrogance, just the criticisms they speak in a day can diminish a great deal of their blessings. That’s why our ancestors said, "Cultivate virtue in your speech; cultivate virtue in your speech." If a person spends a day doing good and accumulating virtue, the mouth plays the biggest role. If you are always affirming, encouraging, and praising others, you accumulate a lot of merit each day. But if you spend a day criticizing, scolding, mocking, or belittling others, then you also lose a lot of blessings. It is said, "Disaster comes from the mouth, and sickness enters through the mouth." Why did Confucius put "virtuous conduct" in first place among his four subjects of teaching, followed by “speech,” then “administration” — the development of practical skills, and lastly “literature”? Therefore, we must subdue dogmatism. It’s very easy to see an image and immediately judge someone to be a certain way, without objectively understanding the situation. And even after making a dogmatic judgment, you don’t seek verification, ultimately creating unnecessary barriers between people. Therefore, one should be frank and direct, and not form a bias after being dogmatic. Furthermore, if you don’t communicate more, that’s not good.

Perhaps it was also the ancestors’ blessing, that even though I never intended to go down the path of education for over 20 years, later, when I was around 25 or 26, I went to Taitung, Taiwan, a place of beautiful mountains and clear waters, seeking the meaning of life. What is the true meaning of life? Sometimes, you really need to be quiet in order to think clearly. "Still water reflects the vast universe." When your mind is turbulent, many things are unclear, and you may not even be able to understand yourself thoroughly. Lao Tzu said, "To know others is intelligence; to know oneself is true wisdom."

I once heard a story that gave me great insight. There was a woodcutter who, for decades, cut firewood for a living. He would diligently cut the wood, and then hurry to the market to sell it. He did this for countless years. Then one day, halfway to the market, he stopped and sat down under a tree. His woodcutter friend happened to pass by, saying, "Old friend, hurry, or the market will close, and you won't be able to sell your firewood. Hurry, hurry!" The woodcutter sitting under the tree replied, "You go ahead, you go ahead. I'm waiting for my soul to catch up before I continue."

In today's urbanized era, everyone’s pace of life is extremely fast. The moment we open our eyes, it's fast, fast, fast: brush our teeth fast; wash our face fast; eat fast; get dressed and put on shoes fast; rush to the car fast; go to class fast; class is over fast; sleep fast, or we'll collapse. Every day, it’s just busy, busy, busy. But is this direction correct? Does it create any genuine value for society?

A friend once told me that one day, he woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and realized that he was 40 years old, and he broke out into a cold sweat. It felt like he hadn't grasped his life’s direction, and he was already 40. Does everyone feel this way? Although we may be 40 years old, when we think back to our elementary school years, we remember it like it was just a few days ago, right? And our junior high years seem like just the past few days. Yet, another 20 years of life has passed.

Why do I think of my friend's words? Because I’m 40 this year as well. And when we think of Confucius's benchmark, "At forty, one has no more doubts," do we still have doubts in our own lives? Do we still have worries and struggles? And we all understand what Mr. Han Yu said, "A teacher's role is to impart the Way, teach skills, and resolve doubts." Resolving doubts is the inherent duty of a teacher. If we ourselves are not free of doubt, if we still have many questions, then how can we resolve the doubts of others? Like the example we cited yesterday, a teacher at a teacher's college, when faced with a student's questions, could only helplessly tell him, “Classmate, I am just as confused as you.” The people most revered by children and students are their parents and teachers. I often speak with parents. Today, a child is walking behind us, following us, when suddenly they tap their father: "Dad, Dad, where are we going?" The father looks back at his child, saying, “You're asking me? I'd have to ask someone else. Let's just take things one step at a time.” But isn't that how we live our lives each day, busy as can be, just taking things one step at a time? Can we plan for the long term? Can we be far-sighted?

So for myself, after living for over 20 years, especially after graduating from university at 22 and going into business, I was chasing after fame and profit. I found that the more I did this, the more empty and unhappy I felt. It felt like my direction was not correct. Of course, many people start businesses to benefit society and make their employees happier. For them, their goal and direction are correct. But if a business is driven solely by the pursuit of fame and profit, it will ultimately be empty. Why? Because "the purpose of life is to improve the life of all of humanity." Life should be about service, not the pursuit of fame and fortune.

At that time, I had no wise teacher to guide me, so after chasing after those things for a few years, I was still unhappy and empty. Fortunately, a chance came along for me to quiet down and reflect. Heaven was very kind. Just as I was calming down, a female teacher at a local school went on a two-month maternity leave. That year, the law stated that only university graduates could work as substitute teachers in elementary schools. Previously, it had been possible to substitute teach with just a high school diploma. There were many high school graduates in the town, and since the salary of a primary school teacher in Taiwan is quite good, these teaching opportunities were immediately snapped up by the teachers' relatives and friends, and there was no chance for me. But that year, the law was changed, and a university degree became a requirement. The entire town couldn't find a single college graduate. So, life is like this – don't be impatient; if an opportunity is meant for you, you can’t avoid it. If it’s not, forcing it won't help either. When you see through life like this, you won't be so worried about gains and losses.

The opportunity really came. The principal asked if I could please substitute teach a first grade class for two months. I was terrified when I heard that, because first graders only came up to my waist. I was afraid I’d accidentally hurt them, having no teaching experience. But he kept asking, because they really couldn't find a university graduate. I suddenly thought of my father's teaching, "Don't push people away." I knew it was hard for them too, so I agreed.

As soon as I agreed, the news traveled back to my family. My mother asked me how many students were in my class. I said seven. On the other end of the phone, my mom said, "In my day, my class had over 60." My mother was filled with the same passion she had 40 years ago, and said, "Okay, I'll come to Taitung and teach a class or two for you to see." See how fortunate I am? My experienced mother came to the rescue. I felt much more at ease. My mother really did drive three to four hundred kilometers to get there. My mom went to teach, and after the first day, we sat down, and my mother sighed, “Ah, I’ve only been retired for a few years, but how can seven kids be harder to teach than 60?” So, now you can understand that today's children, influenced by outside contaminants such as television, are going downhill very quickly. Even just seven children can be difficult to handle. Likewise, in the cities, there are now classes with 40, 50, or even 60 students, which is quite challenging.

Although my time as a substitute teacher was indeed difficult, it gave me the greatest enlightenment and the greatest reward in my life, which is that I feel being a teacher is the most meaningful job in the world. No matter what temptations other fields may offer, I will do this job for the rest of my life. So I'm very grateful to those seven children for the inspiration they gave me. I remember the second day of teaching, I saw three kids squatting on the ground, not knowing what they were doing. So I squatted down to look. They had found some dead ants and were squatting there looking at them. So I quickly buried the ants. The children said, "Why bury them?" I said, “So they can rest in peace.” The kids seemed to understand and nodded. The next day, I saw them squatting there again. I said, "What are you doing today?" They said, "Burying ants so they can rest in peace." And that’s how I saw the pure hearts of children can be easily enlightened. And once their good hearts are truly awakened, it can impact their happiness for their entire lives. Work like that is something that no amount of money can buy.

So, after my two months as a substitute teacher, I returned to my home in Kaohsiung and took the teacher certification program. In Taiwan, after graduating from university, to become a teacher, you have to take another year of education credits. Luckily, I was admitted without difficulty and began working in elementary education. I remember when I was a homeroom teacher, leading a sixth grade class. Many of the boys in sixth grade were taller than me, and you needed to guide their thoughts. Without patience, it was very difficult.

I’ll give you an example. There was a girl who climbed onto the window to clean it. She climbed very high, onto a two-tiered ledge. After she stepped up, she was about to pull off the second tier of the window. She had her hand on it, looking at me: "Teacher, can I pull it off to wash it?" I said, "No, you can't." Not two seconds after I said "no," she still pulled it off. And then her entire body, propelled by gravity, fell down with a "bang." And the glass shattered all over her. Even when you told her not to do something, she still went ahead and did it. When she fell, all the students were frightened. The students may be frightened, but can a teacher be frightened? No. I may have been protected by my ancestors then. At that time, I was very calm. The students were about to rush over, but I said, "Everyone, stop!" Because there was broken glass. “Quickly go get a broom and sweep it up.” I moved the window frame myself and pulled the student out. She was unharmed. Then, I quickly swept it up and tidied up.

At that time, I was very calm, and no other thoughts entered my mind. After finishing that, I started to feel scared. Right? What if she had gotten cut or bled? I would have to take her to get stitches. Ah, and you had already told her not to pull it off, but she still did. Later, I thought, why was she unharmed? It was because I had been having them recite the *Di Zi Gui* (*Standards for Being a Good Student*), the *Three Character Classic*, the *Zhu Zi's Family Maxims*, and the *Wenchang Dijun Yin Zhi Wen* (*The Hidden Virtues of Lord Wenchang*) for a long time. By reciting the teachings of the sages, the ancestors and sages were protecting this class, allowing us to avert danger.

In truth, our ancestors are very loving to us. I’ll share a historical story with you all. Everyone knows, "Dou Yanshan, had a righteous way. He taught his five sons, all renowned and glorious." Dou Yanshan, at the age of 30, had not achieved anything, had no children, and had a very thin fortune. One day, he had a dream in which his grandfather came to him: "Child, you must quickly stop doing evil and start cultivating goodness and accumulating merit, or your lifespan is running out." He was laudable, in that he listened to his grandfather’s words. The day after he woke up, he devoted himself wholeheartedly and without reservation to doing good. This is very important: if you hold something back, your heart is small; if you hold nothing back, your heart is big. A person's blessings grow in proportion to the size of their heart. He really did it. For example, when he found a bag of silver, he thought (and this shows he was always thinking of others), "The owner must be very worried," so he waited there for him. When the owner returned and found the silver, his tears flowed. Why? Because that money could have been for saving lives or even for saving the lives of his family. And whenever his neighbors or community had any needs, such as for weddings or funerals and they had no money, he did his best to help them. And what's more, he founded a free school so that the later generations of his entire clan could study the teachings of the sages, and he also allowed poor people who wanted to study to attend for free.

And today when we see schools such as this, it is often very socially responsible entrepreneurs who establish them. It seems we see many entrepreneurs around the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas putting in money and effort to build educational centers for members of the community to come learn. The Ye couple from our Jumeixin Center, they too are running a school in the role of entrepreneurs. The Chairman Hao Tielong from Xinjiang also runs a school. He says that even their local Party School comes to their school for training. I told him that by training the cadres from the Party School, he is helping create the conditions for many people to hear about traditional culture later on.

And we see that entrepreneurs like Chairman Hao are really embodying “The Great Harmony” from the *Li Yun* (*Book of Rites*). “Embodying” means that the classics become your life and become the way you treat others. For example, “When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all,” and Chairman Hao has a very broad heart, "selecting the wise and employing the able.” He is helping the Party School cultivate talent, which is also helping the nation cultivate talent, and "cultivating trust and cultivating harmony.” Any member of the community can register to listen to classes at his school at any time. He is not "only loving his parents and only loving his own children.” He has also launched an award for filial piety in the nearby primary schools, to encourage children who are filial. He is “not only loving his own children." "To ensure that the elderly have support, the able are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, the orphaned, the lonely, and the disabled are all cared for.” About 30% of the employees in his company are born with disabilities. Isn’t that truly "ensuring that the widowed, the orphaned, the lonely, and the disabled are all cared for?" A person born with a disability going to a company under a compassionate boss does more than just set their mind at ease; it also sets the minds of their family at ease! And he also cares for them very attentively. And so, "Those who love others are always loved by others, and those who respect others are always respected by others." Chairman Hao says that those disabled employees are even more dedicated than normal people. These are all truths that can be proven. And because he is truly this compassionate, his business has become increasingly successful, with so many orders that they can’t finish working until midnight. "Where the Way resides, the whole world will flock to it." Therefore, if people truly follow traditional culture, their family businesses will definitely improve.

And so, Dou Yanshan started the free school and brought blessings to a great many of his descendants as well as to the poor in society. He also cultivated many pillars of society for the nation. His destiny underwent a great change, and he truly received the five blessings. The first blessing is wealth; the second is health; the third is longevity; the fourth is to be virtuous and to love goodness, and not only be virtuous and love goodness yourself, but also that your descendants will be virtuous and love goodness. His five children all became high-ranking officials and were very successful, so he "taught his five sons, all renowned and glorious." The most important of the five blessings is called a peaceful death: to pass away serenely and peacefully. This is the fifth blessing.

I once went to Hong Kong to participate in an event, and in the car, one of my friends, who was local, said, “We Hong Kong people are fast at everything.” When walking on the sidewalks in Hong Kong, you can’t walk slowly. The crowds are so enormous that if you walk slowly, the people behind you will push you along. It’s true that everything is fast. But he said, "The only thing that is slow is when you are about to die." You can’t die; you just drag out the process for two to three months in a hospital, and some for two or three years, or even more than ten years. I will tell you, a person dragging out dying in a hospital for more than ten years – is that a blessing or a misfortune? That is nothing more than suffering!

So, health is a real blessing. Without health, you can't enjoy wealth even if you have it. My father worked at a bank until he retired, and during that time, he saw a lot of wealthy people, and my father mentioned that many wealthy people didn’t pay attention to their health and developed a lot of illnesses by middle age. When eating with them, they can't eat this or that; they have diabetes and high blood pressure, and many dishes on the table are off limits. And when everyone was done eating, they would take out a pack of medication. When they opened it, it would be pills of all colors. They'd say, “This is what I can eat." So, if you don't have health, those blessings you appear to have are hard to enjoy. That’s why health is a treasure for life. In Taiwan, we say that if a person has health, life is colorful, and that if a person does not have health, life is a black and white television, and one cannot see the brilliance.

Dou Yanshan possessed all five blessings, and he lived until his eighties, even though he was meant to have a short life. He is truly a good example of how one can change their destiny. The family of Mr. Fan Zhongyan took Dou Yanshan as their example and always told their descendants that they should emulate Dou Yanshan. In the end, Dou Yanshan, in his eighties, one day purified himself with a vegetarian diet and bathing. He washed himself very cleanly, and then bid farewell to all his relatives and friends. He made all the arrangements, and then simply sat down and passed away. This has all been recorded in history. Therefore, all 25 histories of China are a record of cause and effect, and this is consistent with the truth that the *I Ching* (Book of Changes) tells us at the beginning: “A family that accumulates good will have abundant blessings, and a family that accumulates evil will have abundant misfortunes.”

In the time of Yue Fei, there was a minister who worked with Qin Hui to harm Yue Fei, and in the end, Yue Fei was murdered. This is one of the greatest injustices in Chinese history. And that minister died not long after, as his karmic retribution was too great. And his son, Luo Yuan, thought that what his father had done was a mistake, and so he never dared enter the Yue Fei Temple. After Yue Fei died, the common people greatly missed him and built him a temple. Luo Yuan had a conscience, and he devoted himself to diligently fulfilling his political duties and did a number of good things, thinking that perhaps the good he did could counteract some of his karmic burdens. He finally mustered the courage to enter the Yue Fei Temple, and when he knelt down to kowtow, he collapsed and died as soon as his head touched the ground the first time. This was recorded in the 25 Histories. His father’s karmic retribution was too great. This illustrates that “A family that accumulates evil will have abundant misfortunes.”

So, we are actually one and the same as our descendants, and one and the same as our ancestors. Among all the world's many cultures, only Chinese culture has been continuously passed down. This is not a coincidence, because the ancestors of any one of us were saints. As long as your family genealogy has been preserved, you can absolutely find it. A few days ago, I met a teacher named Su in Kunming. He was a 28th-generation descendant of Mr. Su Dongpo and a 72nd-generation descendant of Su Wu. I said, "Your family is full of patriotic loyalty." Su Wu in the Han Dynasty, and the great scholar Su in the Song Dynasty, were all loyal subjects. "You cannot disgrace your family; you also need to do your best to preserve our culture.” It is true that our culture has been passed down for 5,000 years, and this is not by accident; it is because of the protection of our ancestors. And we today are the ancestors of our descendants, so we must be good examples for them to follow, not doing bad and harming our descendants. We absolutely don't want to be that kind of person.

Dou Yanshan's story gives us much to reflect on. You can see that his ancestors truly loved and protected him and even helped him in a dream. So there are many times our ancestors are protecting us in the unseen realm. There is a woman in Xinjiang, whom I met in May. She told me this story. She said that her company’s boss studied traditional culture and brought many good DVDs and books to the company, saying he would give them out for free. She was very happy when she heard it was free, so she kept moving them, and took a big box of them home. But when she got home, she didn't look at them. She put them under the bed. So, you can see she still had the habit of trying to take advantage of others.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**A Box Under the Bed**

One day, her three-year-old daughter came to her and told her (the little girl’s grandfather had already passed away), “Mommy, yesterday I dreamt of Grandpa. He told me to tell you to quickly take out the box of books from under the bed and study them properly.” Her mother was startled. How could her deceased father-in-law know there was a box of books under the bed? When she took it out, one of the books inside was called *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, a family instruction manual on how to change one's destiny, written by Mr. Yuan Liao-Fan during the Ming Dynasty. At that time, she was also considering divorcing her husband. Immediately, her deceased father-in-law’s spirit had intervened to remind her. After reading the book, she felt deeply ashamed and began to correct her mistakes and change her ways.

Our ancestors truly love and protect us. Therefore, if you are truly dedicated to continuing the legacy of the ancient sages and creating a peaceful world for future generations, then you are the “only child” of the great rulers Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu, as well as the Duke of Zhou. They will wholeheartedly cultivate you and protect you in the unseen realm, and their blessings will descend upon you. My reasoning for this is based on solid principles. Let me ask you, if you had two or three children, who would you pass on your family business to? You would definitely pass it on to the most filial and responsible one, right? Would you pass it on to the arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute one? You would definitely pass it on to the one who is most responsible and filial, as only they can maintain the family's legacy. So our Chinese nation, our ancient sages and virtuous ancestors, possess such virtue. Anyone who makes this commitment, who possesses “the utmost filial piety and brotherly love,” as the *Classic of Filial Piety* says, “can communicate with the divine and illuminates the four seas, there is nothing that they cannot accomplish.” Director Zhang promoted ethical and moral education throughout the entire prison system in Hainan province. He and his eight subordinates quickly rose in the ranks and now hold important positions. This was due not only to their hard work, but also the blessings that our ancestors added to their lives, enabling them to make great contributions to the nation and its people.

Truly, when a single thought arises in a person’s mind, the entire universe receives it. Some scientists, modern physicists and quantum mechanics experts, have discovered that a person’s mind can change the entire universe. This is the focus of cutting-edge scientific research. Dr. Masaru Emoto conducted experiments with water. When people spoke words of gratitude to water, the crystals formed were exceptionally beautiful. When people spoke hurtful words to water, the crystals formed were ugly. Water is a material substance, and a person's intention influences the entire environment, changing it completely. So quantum physicists concluded that the mind can control matter, that a person's mind can affect the entire material world. Just like the example I gave yesterday about the *Book of Documents*: "When good deeds are done, a hundred blessings descend." The world is full of auspiciousness. But "When bad deeds are done, a hundred calamities descend." Everything is determined by the mind. Therefore, "inner sagehood and outer kingship" is the wisdom of our traditional culture. "Inner sagehood" refers to making this heart kind, and constantly aligning ourselves with the realm of the sages.  "Outer kingship" refers to being a role model, someone who can inspire harmony within families, states, and the world. So cultivating one's mind and character is fundamental.

When I decided to follow the path of a teacher, everything went incredibly smoothly, and I felt my ancestors were protecting me.  When teaching a class, I truly feel that a teacher is responsible for the safety of the class every single day. We also hope that our students will develop the correct values and beliefs that will benefit them their entire lives, and this requires a lot of effort. There are also many notebooks to grade. So it really is quite tiring, a four to five month semester. During winter and summer breaks, we really just take a breather. People who aren't teachers think, “Wow, teachers have it so good, with all those winter and summer vacations.” They don't know the real story. After becoming a teacher myself, I apologized to my mother and said, “Mom, I’m sorry. I always thought you had it easy, but it’s actually really hard.” (To all the principals, teachers, and colleagues, you really do work hard, attending twenty-one days of courses. If you are truly tired, then it’s okay to get some rest. Based on the principle of return on investment, it is most effective to sleep when you are most tired. You might only need five or ten minutes to regain your energy. If you try to force yourself to stay awake, you might be half-asleep for the entire class, and that's a waste. So, if you feel sleepy, it’s okay to sleep. But you need to cooperate with us; while sleeping, please only nod forward, this will inspire us while we are on stage. You can’t sway from side to side, because when we see you swaying while we are speaking, we lose our confidence. Also, swaying from side to side may hit the people beside you, and that is not good. So it is wonderful that we have this understanding. When people treat each other with mutual consideration, there is warmth everywhere, and a sense of comfort.)

Under the protection of my ancestors, I entered the field of elementary education.  I also understood that the meaning of life needs to be explored, and that I can fully utilize my position to make a difference. Like I mentioned yesterday, “Be a lifelong benefactor to children,” this is our topic today.  Yesterday, we discussed this topic as well. When should it happen? How should it happen? To what degree?  "Children" not only refers to our own children, our students, but also to the next generation of our people and the future generations of the world.  With such broad-mindedness, let us discuss this topic, let us delve deeply into the teachings of our ancestors. When we "be a lifelong benefactor to children," we are imbuing them with the wisdom and educational principles that are most important for their character and conduct throughout their lives, which can enable them to have a happy life.

To be a lifelong benefactor to children, first and foremost we must be a benefactor to whom?  To ourselves. If we are always busy, and always worrying, and we cannot change our own lives, then how can we possibly change the lives of children? So, our second key point, we must also think clearly about the meaning of our own lives.

Yesterday we talked about the value of life. The first sentence of *The Great Learning* states, "The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting bright virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in the highest good." It’s about accomplishing oneself and also accomplishing the people we are connected with in life. This is its meaning, and it corresponds very well with the Chinese character “yi (義),” which means “righteousness.” The character “yi (義)” is a pictophonetic character. The *Shuowen Jiezi* says that it is "composed of 'I' (我) and 'sheep' (羊)." "I" refers to oneself, and "sheep" represents goodness and auspiciousness.  In other words, when a person truly fulfills their duty, they can perfect themselves, and their life will surely be auspicious.  "Heaven is impartial, and always favors the virtuous."  From this "I," we understand that how does a person constantly elevate their spirit and wisdom throughout their life? By continuously doing good and continuously benefiting others.  So, looking at the meaning of “yi (義)” through words, we can see that it forms “renyi (仁義, benevolence and righteousness), “daoyi (道義, moral obligation),” and also “qingyi (情義, affection and loyalty).” Chinese characters, words, and idioms all open our wisdom. What else comes to mind?  “Xinyi (信義, trustworthiness and righteousness), “zhongyi (忠義, loyalty and righteousness), and “jieyi (節義, integrity and righteousness).” Do you see how each word highlights how we must implement and fulfill this “yi” (義) in our lives? This includes “liyi (禮義, courtesy and righteousness)," because the Chinese nation is a nation of ritual and righteousness. By understanding this "yi", we can realize that fulfilling this responsibility can create great value in life.

We know that human life is only a few decades long, and it will eventually pass.  But we cannot have lived in this world for nothing. Therefore, anyone who has truly thought about the meaning of life will think about, “A person leaves behind a good name, a leopard leaves behind his hide.” This name is most important when one sets an example for the world.  Wise people leave behind what they can, and take away what they can.  But what do those without wisdom busy themselves with?  They busy themselves with things they cannot keep. And what do they accumulate?  Things they cannot take with them.  As I was saying earlier, people in Hong Kong are fast in everything except dying.  Why can’t they let go of their last breath? They have too much that they can't let go of, and it keeps them dragging on. Ultimately, they still can’t take it away, “Nothing can be taken away.”

Think about it, everyone's life ultimately seems the same, so if you first examine life from the perspective of your final moment, and then live your life, it will be different. Let's review, what is the final moment of life? When we used to watch TV, it was always the same, right? When the last breath is taken, that's it.  Buddha once asked his students, "How long is life?" One student said, "A few decades," the second student said "Maybe a few short hours." Finally, Buddha said, "Life is in between breaths.”  When impermanence comes, it can be like crossing over to another life. So, the final moment is like that, you can’t take anything with you, so why do we spend most of our effort pursuing things that we can’t take with us? You can’t even take your body, how could you possibly take anything else that is outside your body? So, if you take a calm look, many people cannot see through these things. They want to live in a big house, drive a big car, and indulge in pleasure. They can’t take any of it with them, and it even harms their own health.

Some parents and elders can’t think straight. They want to leave a lot of money for their children. But what is the result? It becomes a source of misfortune. Our ancestors left us a saying, "Do not destroy your body with addictions and desires, and do not destroy your descendants with wealth.” When someone develops bad habits or addictions, they are destroying their body, especially when they are not being filial. When we have these bad habits, our parents worry every single day. Being filial brings blessings, and causing our parents to worry every day diminishes our own blessings. Also, not being willing to change bad habits is called not cherishing oneself. How can someone who does not cherish themselves love others? So as parents, teachers, and principals, we must have excellent habits, so that we can be a role model for our children.  I remember one school in junior high that wanted to stop students from dyeing their hair. No matter how strict they were, nothing worked. The teachers were very tired and were having a debriefing meeting in the office. When everyone sighed and sat down, one teacher suddenly noticed, "Many of our teachers dye their hair." So if our teachers are dyeing their hair, and we tell our students not to, how is that possible? They will only be more defiant. So, setting an example is being filial, and also cherishing oneself.

"Do not destroy your descendants with wealth." The *Three Character Classic* reminds us, "People leave their children with chests full of gold," ordinary people who do not have insight leave their children with great wealth, "While I teach my children only the classics."  The descendants of Fan Gong prospered for eight to nine hundred years. What he left to his descendants was "the righteous responsibility of helping the poor," of helping the entire family, and helping countless people who were poor. This is the righteousness that he left to his children and grandchildren. At the time he was alive, he had one thousand mu (a Chinese unit of land measurement) of charity fields, and by the Qing Dynasty, Fan Gong’s descendants had four thousand mu of charity fields, surpassing their predecessors.  So the blessings of his descendants were extremely great, because they inherited his sense of responsibility.

Lin Gong also had some very important words. He said, "If my descendants are like me," If my descendants are of similar quality to me and are doing well, "what is the point of leaving them money?" What’s the point of leaving them money? "If they are virtuous and have much wealth, they will undermine their ambition." He would think, "My dad earned enough, why should I work hard?" This will weaken their ambitions. "If my descendants are not like me, what is the point of leaving them money?" If my descendants are already worse than me, what is the point of leaving them money? "If they are foolish and have much wealth, their mistakes will increase." If your descendants are already worse than you, and you leave them with much wealth, it will only make them more arrogant and dissolute. Isn’t that destroying your descendants with wealth?

Such examples are very common nowadays. In the newspapers, we see so many examples of large business owners who have passed away and then the whole family immediately starts fighting over the inheritance. It goes on for years, and their coffins haven't even been buried. They made so much money, but in the end, they don't have a place to rest in peace.  So, people’s plans cannot match the plan of heaven. That is a source of misfortune after death. I will give you an example of how it can be a source of misfortune even before death.

In Tainan, Taiwan, there was a business person who was also very loyal.  He worked for one company his entire life and accumulated twenty billion New Taiwan Dollars. Twenty billion is not a small sum. And how much did he spend building his house? One hundred million. When I heard this, the first thought I had was, “This is the beginning of his downfall.” When you are rich, and show off and splurge like that, your descendants will follow your example, and you are destined to fail. In history, no family has been known to prosper when the parents were extravagant.  If you want a family to prosper for three to four generations, Zeng Guofan said that you must uphold diligence and thrift. If you want a family to prosper for five to six generations, you must be cautious and humble. If you want a family to prosper for eight to ten or more generations, you must practice filial piety and brotherly love. He studied so many families and this is the conclusion he came to.

If you spend a hundred million building a house, the first thing your descendants will think is, "My father is rich." Then they will start to spend money wildly. Second, building a one hundred million dollar house is just telling the thieves, "Come visit my house anytime." Where is the wisdom in that? Moreover, the ancestors also left a very important saying, "When blessings are exhausted, one dies."  The amount of blessings and good fortune a person has in this lifetime is something they cultivated, when their blessings are used up, then this life ends. But if we think about this further, what happens if a person is very frugal? If a person was only supposed to live until they were sixty, but because they haven't used up their blessings, they might live to eighty, adding twenty more years.  So "blessings come from a life of frugality."

My grandmother's health was poor when she was in her forties, but she was extremely frugal. Everywhere she went, she would turn off the lights, and she would use a piece of tissue paper two or three times. When we saw her, we all thought, "Oh my, how can she be so frugal?" But it had meaning. Frugality is a virtue, and we children and grandchildren were influenced by that, and we all developed a habit of frugality. If a person is very extravagant, they might have been able to live until eighty, but by the time they reach fifty, they have used up all their blessings. Do you see how wildly young people spend money nowadays? So they use up their blessings by fifty and lose thirty years of their lives. So we cannot squander our wealth. Wealth is taken from society, and it should be used for the benefit of society. Through the cooperation of many factors in society, we are able to accumulate wealth. With this understanding, we should repay society, rather than spend it wildly. In Taiwan, there was a well-known person, who also splurged money. He made his toilet out of solid gold. When we were young, we were deeply impressed. Because this person spent money like that, before long, his health deteriorated and he died. This is also an example of blessings being used up, and death coming.

So, if we leave money, we destroy our children and leave behind a source of misfortune.  As I mentioned earlier, the man who spent one hundred million building his house, his children developed bad habits of extravagance and also became gamblers. He had a stroke, and he was no longer able to control things. In less than a year, all twenty billion was squandered away. This was a source of misfortune even before he passed away. Let me ask you, is their family’s tragedy over? It’s only just starting. Because his children are already adults, and they have developed many bad habits. How easy is it to change? Unless they encounter ethical and moral training courses, right? So when we deliver these important ethical and moral education to every family, we can change their family’s destiny.

So, the previous example is how a person without wisdom manages their life. A person with wisdom, like Fan Gong or Lin Gong, leaves behind hidden virtues that protect future generations, and leaves the best example for future generations to follow. This is not only the case for families, but for our workplaces, and our schools.  As teachers, we always remember what our principal, Principal Chen or Principal Wang, said to us, the advice they gave and the school spirit they left behind, had a profound and lasting impact. Even after decades, they still influence the school. Then, it's certain that what you left behind will remain. And what can we take away? The elevation of our spirit, the elevation of our wisdom, and all the good deeds we’ve accumulated in our lives can be taken with us. The time will come when the consequences of your actions will be seen.  How could any seed that is planted not have a harvest?

Okay, now that we have this understanding, we must realize the meaning of life in our current position. In the *Collection of Books 360*, there is a passage, “Position is the loom for establishing virtue; power is the shuttle for practicing righteousness. Sages step on the loom and hold the shuttle, weaving the transformations of heaven and earth, making all things compliant and human relationships correct.”

The passage begins, “Position is the loom,” Our current position is the loom for establishing virtue, a loom, or weaving machine, for establishing virtue. “Power is the shuttle,” Our power is the authority that we exercise in our position. “Power is the shuttle for practicing righteousness,” a shuttle for putting righteousness into practice. The entire loom must work with the shuttle, so when you have a position, you also have power. I once heard a retired principal from Singapore, who was in his seventies, say that he had a great reputation and influence in the Singaporean education sector. After he retired, he realized the importance of *The Standards for Being a Good Student*. But because he was retired, he felt regret that if he was still in office, he could influence the entire Singaporean education sector. But because he was retired, his influence was far less than when he held office. His regret deeply touched many principals who were in office. So we cannot wait. If we miss the opportune moment, it will be too late to regret it. “Sages step on the loom and hold the shuttle,” this is a metaphor, the sages step on the loom and hold the shuttle, weaving the transformations of heaven and earth, “acting on behalf of heaven.”

Confucius and Mencius spoke about morality and righteousness, teaching people the principles of being a person, which allowed “all things to be compliant.” Nowadays, we know how many species are becoming extinct. Do you know why? It is caused by humankind destroying nature.  In this world, if one species becomes extinct, the other species will have a seven-day and seven-night carnival to celebrate. Do you know which species that is? We know ourselves very well. Do you feel that people are living a life that is upside down? The most spiritual of all beings have become the killers of all beings. This is a terrible waste of the place that our ancestors gave to us as humans, "the three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity.” Humans should emulate the selfless nurturing spirit of heaven and earth, this is human dignity.  But now we’ve become killers.  If we understand righteousness, and if we have love, “loving our relatives and then being benevolent to the people, being benevolent to the people and then loving all creatures,” then we will truly make “all things compliant and human relationships correct.” From this, we can understand that traditional culture emphasizes what kind of education above all else? Ethical and moral education. If people don’t understand ethics, they won’t know how to be human beings.

In Guangdong, there was a school whose dean of academics attended a five-day traditional culture course in Shenzhen in July of 2004. After the course, the dean of academics told us that in those five days he took more notes than in the four years he spent at the Normal School. When I heard that, I felt great pain in my heart. Why? This dean of academics had a great love for education and a sense of mission. Otherwise, why would he be so dedicated in his studies, after becoming the dean? But why wasn’t his sense of mission and his passion ignited during the four years he spent at the Normal School? Because we didn't teach them the wisdom and philosophy of traditional culture first.  Instead, we taught them modern education theories, and whether those theories are correct is still debatable.

Let me give you an example. When we studied theories before, we did experiments on dogs, experiments on cats, and experiments on mice, and then, who did we use the results of those experiments on? People. So, what do you think we will teach people to become? Animals. Dogs? I tell you, becoming a dog would be good. Why? Because we used the experiments on dogs and cats, so our goal was for people to be like dogs and cats.  If we are not careful, we may become worse than dogs and cats. Do you see how many people nowadays hurt their parents and grandparents? Isn't it us who produced them? Good people are taught, and bad people are taught. If we teach wrong, it will be very serious.

This translation should accurately convey the message of the original Chinese text while being easily understandable and engaging for an English-speaking audience.


Okay, here's a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and natural English flow, while maintaining the tone of the original:

**Setting Our Sights**

Today, we set our sights on becoming sages. Even if we fall short, we might still become virtuous men. If we aim for virtue, we might, at the very least, become gentlemen. And if we aspire to be gentlemen, we might still be decent people, even with some shortcomings, right? But now, if we set our sights on dogs and cats, what will come next? It will be a disaster.

So, what is our greatest calamity? The loss of national self-confidence. We have had methods for producing sages and virtuous people for five thousand years. We have five thousand years of theory, five thousand years of philosophy, and five thousand years of experience, methods, and results. We don't use them. Instead, we think that the moon is rounder in other countries, so we adopt their theories to teach. The problem isn't just about China's next generation, it's about the education of the next generation worldwide. Even the U.S. Secretary of Education has admitted that their education system is failing. In the UK, who rioted? Students! And these weren't students without degrees; they were rioting against their own nation. The crime rate in the U.S. is among the highest in the world. Their next generation has been educated like this, so why are we still learning from their education system? This is fundamentally a problem of confidence.

Actually, if I hadn't encountered the classics of our ancestors, I would also lack confidence. I remember often asking my classmates, "What do you think of me as a person?" My friends would say, "Do you want the truth or a lie?" You needed a pretty strong heart to hear the truth. Some classmates even used personality tests. For example, if you scored 40, they'd say you were like a koala; if you scored 50, they'd say you were like a tiger; and if you scored 60, you were a peacock type. I've done all those personality tests. After doing them, I was happy to tell people, “I'm like a koala!” Looking back now, I feel like I was truly letting down my ancestors. Our ancestors in heaven must have thought, "How can my descendants live like animals and be happy about it?" Right? Being compared to a koala is like being compared to an animal and yet we’re happy! What a shame!

So, how should Chinese personality tests be designed? They should be designed to tell you: "You have the filial piety of Emperor Shun, the benevolence of Emperor Yao, the magnanimity of Emperor Tang Taizong, and the commitment to putting 'the worries of the world before one's own happiness and the joy of the world after one's own' of Fan Zhongyan." After taking such a test, wouldn’t people take a deep breath and think, "Wow, I have so many virtues of the sages! I need to live up to my potential. I can’t waste myself or let myself down." This kind of confidence is so important.

This particular director of academic affairs was truly dedicated to learning. After returning from a workshop, he immediately gathered three colleagues who shared his passion. The four of them started studying traditional culture every week. They also arranged for three homeroom teachers, all male, to attend a five-day course in Shanghai in October. Shortly after they started implementing what they learned, the changes in those three classes were noticeable. The principal of the school, a woman, noticed it as she passed by and started to investigate. She discovered that they were promoting traditional culture, especially the "Standards for Being a Good Student and Child" (Di Zi Gui). The principal then announced to all the faculty, "Our children can learn English a little slower, but they must learn filial piety and how to be a person immediately!" She then promoted it throughout the school.

One day, her husband saw an article in the newspaper where an expert criticized "Di Zi Gui" for promoting blind obedience. This so-called expert, with such a respected position, should have been more careful about his words. Did he even read the book? Did he examine it in depth? His criticism caused people to lose confidence, and he should be held responsible for those consequences. Those of us who have studied it in depth know that “Di Zi Gui” does not promote blind obedience. It teaches that “when parents have faults, we should advise them to change,” while "maintaining a pleasant expression and a soft tone.” Her husband showed her the article: “Someone is criticizing it. You're still promoting it throughout the school. You need to be careful; you don't want to make a wrong decision." His wife, a woman of great cultivation, the principal, replied, "He has his point of view, and I have my responsibilities." She did not criticize the professor, she said, "He has his point of view, and I have my responsibilities. The middle school near our school has many students who get abortions every time after a long break. I don't want my students to live like that. I need to strengthen their moral roots now." After she finished, her husband looked at her and said, "I think you are fit to be the leader of our country." She truly was an exceptional woman.

This reminds me of a university teacher who told me about one of his students. She was a female athlete in the physical education department, who was quite robust when she started university. However, when she graduated four years later, she was skin and bones. The teacher knew, and this doesn't include what he didn't know, that she had had four abortions. These children just don’t know! They didn’t have the chance to learn the moral principles taught in elementary school. In just four years, this girl had completely ruined her body and depleted her blessings. If she had been taught these principles in kindergarten and elementary school, or even if the university had a one-week curriculum of ethics, morals, and Chinese culture for their students at the start of their studies, I believe they would have had a completely different four years.

From 2009, Datong University has been promoting traditional culture for all first-year students. Now it is the fifth year. It’s truly extraordinary. This is called “being careful at the start.” When you introduce the right ideas and values at the beginning of a significant opportunity, their four years won’t be wasted. I didn't have the opportunity to meet such student affairs directors, nor did I have such good opportunities. When I entered university, my senior students told me that "university" means "you play for four years." I was misled, and the prime years of my life were wasted. People’s fates differ depending on the opportunities they encounter. To meet principals and teachers as wonderful as all of you is a blessing for all students.

That female principal was a great inspiration to me. From my own first-hand experience, I see things not just getting worse generation by generation, but worse year by year. A university teacher told me the other day that it’s not even getting worse year by year now, but worse day by day! If correct values are not instilled in them, the students don’t have the immunity; there are too many temptations, and they fall quickly. In Taiwan, I am paid with public funds, with taxpayers' hard-earned money. My duty is to cultivate good future generations for society. But what I see before me is things getting worse, year by year, and even day by day. I have to find the root cause of the problem, or I am neglecting my duty. Later, I realized it was the lack of education in virtue and ethics. Thinking more deeply, I realized that it wasn’t just the students who were lacking such education; I was too. My understanding of traditional culture was also shallow. I needed to learn it more thoroughly.

So, when I realized that virtue was the most important thing, that it was the root, and yet I lacked that foundation, I resigned from my job to study with my teachers. Later, I was given the opportunity to share traditional culture with parents in Haikou in 2003. These are the situations in front of us. If we see what is right and fail to act, we are without courage. We must do what is right, otherwise we would fail to live up to the teachings of Confucius. Only then can we be worthy of the trust placed in us by the taxpayers, and the trust of all these parents.

A few years ago, I went to Malaysia and met an elder, Mr. Shen Muyu. From the old man’s name, you can tell what his father expected of him. He admired Guan Yu, a man renowned for his righteousness. He truly lived up to it, because when the Malaysian government wanted to abolish Chinese language education—Indonesia had abolished it for over 30 years, preventing Chinese from being studied—millions of Chinese in Malaysia rose up to defend their Chinese cultural heritage. Mr. Shen was one of their leaders. He was jailed several times. The Malaysian prison officials tried both hard and soft tactics to make him submit. They even tried to persuade him by offering him titles and wealth. He replied to a Malaysian official, “If the Chinese wanted to destroy the Malaysian language today, I believe that you would also stand up!” The official was moved and treated Mr. Shen with great respect from that day on. So, a person of righteousness can receive respect even in prison. This is also a case of our ancestors' protection.

We were honored to get to know him. I remember the first time I met him, he was already 95 years old. This man had been a principal for 70 years, breaking world records in his devotion to education. At 95, he played the organ and led us in singing patriotic songs about resisting Japan. The behavior of such elders leaves a lasting impression. He also encouraged the young people, saying, "Teaching is the least profitable profession." The old man was humorous; it’s not a job where you can make lots of money. He continued, "But it's the most important one because it transmits knowledge, educates, and resolves doubts. It carries on our culture, and this is the most important thing for an entire people."

This is especially true in our modern society. A Chinese person from Hong Kong wrote an article saying that the Chinese are a people with the longest history and the greatest wisdom in the world, yet in just a few decades, we've become the most shortsighted. So shortsighted that people are willing to kill their own parents and relatives for a few hundred dollars. This is the reality we face today. Why? Because of cultural discontinuity, it has not been passed down. These chaotic phenomena, unheard of a couple hundred years ago, are happening in our society now. The value and importance of culture are clear in our generation. If we are to turn things around, we need to shoulder the historical responsibility to do so.

"Establishing a nation and leading the people begins with teaching." In the next session, we will discuss where the roots of humanity’s suffering are, on both a personal and global level. We will explore the causes of problems in our families, and in our society. Doctors treat people’s physical lives, teachers treat their intellectual lives. We must find the root of the sickness in society if we are to prescribe the right medicine. That medicine also requires long-term education. That's why “teaching is the priority” if we are to achieve any results. "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." Education isn’t something for which you can take a quick cure, those will have side effects. Okay, in our next session, we will share two main topics: first, the root causes of human suffering, and second, how we can “establish a nation and lead the people by prioritizing teaching” in this era. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text:

**Lecture Four: The Suffering of Humankind**

Respected Principals, esteemed colleagues in education, good morning everyone!

We were just discussing how doctors save lives, rescuing people's physical beings. What about teachers? They inspire wisdom, they inspire goodness, and they save people's spiritual lives. There's a story that my mentors told me before I became a teacher, and it made a very deep impression on me. There was a doctor who disregarded human life and was cast into the eighteenth level of hell. But even in the eighteenth level of hell, this doctor wouldn't admit his mistake. He was angry, saying, “I didn't do it on purpose! Why did you give me such a heavy sentence?” This doctor had not learned *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (Di Zi Gui), so he didn't admit his wrongdoings. Learning the *Di Zi Gui* is very important. “If you admit your mistake, it is as if it never happened; if you try to hide it, you will only make it worse." This way, the karmic debt cannot be resolved. So he got angry and started stomping his feet, very heavily. Suddenly, he heard a voice from below saying, “Hey, buddy, stop stomping! The dust is falling on me.” The doctor was shocked. Was there another level below the eighteenth level of hell? He was very surprised and said to the person below, “I was a doctor who disregarded human life and was sent to the eighteenth level of hell. You're on the nineteenth level below me. What did you do?” The voice from below replied, “I was a teacher.”

Although this is a joke, it's worth pondering. Because if a teacher's thinking is correct, it opens up people’s wisdom. And this student, in the future, will become a father and mother, perhaps even a national leader, or even someone involved in education. One correct thought influences their life, influences their family, influences their next generation, and influences all those whose paths they cross in life. So if a teacher cultivates a sage, the merit is immense. How immense was the merit of Fan Zhongyan’s teacher? Even a computer might not be able to calculate it. But if a teacher does not teach students the correct view on life and instead teaches wrong ideas, then they are severing the wisdom of others and misleading their students. This doesn't just affect the student, but also affects the student when they become parents, and then their children will suffer. Including if they become a leader in the future, and they are only pursuing profits, then they might exploit many people. Those responsibilities, apart from the individual bearing them, their teacher will also have to bear them. This is not something I made up, the *Three Character Classic* says, "To teach the child is the father's duty; to not be strict is the teacher's laziness." In this day and age, we need to speak with restraint, you’re too direct and people will remember that. We don't want to create animosity with anyone in this lifetime.

I myself was an elementary school teacher, and at that time my students were all eleven or twelve years old. After a few years, I was very cautious when reading the newspapers, checking to see if any of my students were mentioned. If it was something good, then okay. But if it was my student who had done something wrong, wow, then that's a problem. The judge in the afterlife would record a demerit because I didn’t teach my students well. But if I had taught them, then the responsibility wouldn’t be mine. So the teacher’s noble role, to enlighten people’s wisdom, impacts an individual, a family, a clan, and society in a profound and long lasting way.

So, if teachers are enlightening the spiritual lives of people, where exactly are people's current ideas skewed? Because thought determines action, action determines habits, habits form character, and character determines destiny. A person's thoughts determine their own fate, parents' thoughts determine their children’s fate, teachers' and principals' thoughts can very likely influence students' destinies, an entrepreneur’s thoughts can determine the fate of their team, a national leader’s thoughts influence the nation’s destiny, and the thoughts of modern Chinese people will influence the destiny of the world. Because in the 1970s, Professor Arnold Toynbee said that the only way to solve the social problems of the 21st century is through the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and Mahayana Buddhism. This means that the only way to save the world now is through traditional Chinese culture. Did your life undergo a chemical change after hearing this? Did anyone feel so excited that they couldn’t sleep at night, finally understanding, "Ah! Now I know why I was reborn into this world. I finally understand. I came here for this purpose. I came for my nation, I came for the world." That feeling of realization is what Confucius meant by “knowing one’s destiny at fifty.” Knowing what your mission is in this lifetime.

And as everyone thinks about it, even when you guide your children and students with correct thoughts, sometimes your children may not understand you, and may even lose their temper with you. So parents have to practice "not being resentful when others don't understand," which is the mark of a noble person. Should parents strive to be noble people? You are doing your best for your children, and they still misunderstand you, even losing their temper at you. At this time, the mother should be like the earth, accepting and not arguing with the child. The earth, you see, so many animals defecate on it, not only does it not get angry but it turns the waste into fertilizer, and uses it to nourish all things. Have you noticed that during our growth, we often lose our temper, and our mothers, very cultivated, would just accept it. Afterwards, when we calmed down, we would feel ashamed and apologize to our mother. That kind of tolerance from our mothers is also enlightening us. So when we are unkind to our parents, our parents still embrace us with the warmth of a spring breeze.

So even when your thoughts are correct, your children might not necessarily understand. This is something I’ve come to understand very deeply. Actually, parents and children are connected at heart. I am connected to my father at heart as well. I remember when my older sister didn't get into university, my father arranged for her to go to tutoring. Although I didn't hear the reason directly from my father, I completely understood his heart. What was my father seeing? He was seeing my sister's whole life, her future. So he was worried that if my sister didn't get into university this time and only went to vocational school, then she wouldn't be able to go to university, and later when her younger sisters and brothers went to university, she would feel inferior. So when parents consider things, they consider very far ahead. But, will the children appreciate it? Not necessarily.

Later, my sister went to tutoring. One day, her eyes felt uncomfortable, and she called my father. My father said, “I’ll take the day off tomorrow to take you to the doctor.” But after hanging up the phone, he was still uneasy. He immediately took a leave and rushed to the tutoring center to find my sister to take her to the doctor. You can see the father’s concern for his daughter. When he got to the tutoring center, he found out that my sister had skipped class that day. Think about it. A father, so worried, rushing there to take his daughter to the doctor, and it turned out his daughter had skipped class. The father worked hard to pay for her tuition, and his daughter didn't go to class! When he got home that day, my father very gently asked my sister, "Where did you go today?" At that time I really admired my father, that he could ask my sister so gently. But my sister became embarrassed and angry, immediately losing her temper, "It's all your fault for forcing me to go to tutoring! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had to go!" She went on and on complaining. A father was thinking about her whole life, but received such misunderstanding from his daughter, who even lost her temper at him. My second sister and I looked at each other, thinking, “Oh no, my sister is being too much. How is Dad going to take it?” We looked at each other, wondering, is a storm going to break out?

But suddenly, after my sister finished her rant, she went to her room. My father then called my second sister and me into the room. He then said, "If there's anything your father did wrong, you two can tell me now." At that moment, all three of us siblings had felt since we were small that being born into our family was the greatest blessing in our life. Although our family wasn’t wealthy, our parents were civil servants, but it was a very warm family. Our parents loved us very much. For example, even though my father’s salary was not high, he bought a second-hand car that someone had already used for ten years. What did that convey? It conveyed that he loved us with all his effort, and wanted to leave us with wonderful memories. After buying that car we often went on trips, although the back seat was slanted and all three kids were crammed in, it was still very warm. And one time we went to Guanzi Ling in Tainan, and because the car was old, the slope was too high, and halfway up it began rolling backwards, so our whole family had to get out and push the car. Look how sweet these memories are. Although it wasn't a Mercedes or a BMW, it was full of father's wholehearted love. So at that time, we felt that we were the happiest.

My sister had made such a mistake, but my father not only didn’t blame her, but he asked us if he had done anything wrong that we could bring up. My second sister and I looked at each other, feeling extremely moved. Our father’s attitude influenced us, "If your actions don’t achieve the desired outcome, turn inward and examine yourself." Even when his daughter was wrong to that degree, he was still reflecting on himself. That is a father, when your thoughts are correct, you still might not be understood by your children.

Similarly, a leader who is always thinking of their subordinates, like all of you principals, or leaders in the business world, you are also really thinking about how you can make the teachers' future careers in education more valuable, better, and smoother. These people in the business world also hope that their employees can have truly happy lives. But it’s possible that when you return and arrange some training courses, the teachers under you won't understand you. Is that possible? So at this time, you have to remember that we have already been forewarned here at Jumeixin. At this time you have to recite a line, "Not to be resentful when others don't understand, is that not the mark of a noble person?" Confucius's words are very useful. If you feel you are at a dead end, as soon as you bring up Confucius's words, you will see a new path open up.

The CEO of Nanjing Phoenix, Li Musong, has already retired. I remember one year he arranged for his employees to study in Tangchi. He was very kind. He considered that that day was a Sunday, and his drivers had their own families, so he didn't want his employees to have to work overtime on Sunday. So, the CEO himself drove his colleagues to Lujiang to attend the course. We were all very touched when we heard that. But his employees were thinking in the car, "This CEO must be taking us for brainwashing. Once we're done with this course, we’ll all listen to him and work for him. He must have an ulterior motive." How did we know his employees were thinking like this? It was because one of his employees shared his confession after taking the course for a few days. After taking the course for a few days, he finally understood how to get along with his wife, where his problems in life were, and he was very grateful to the CEO, but when they were taking him there, he was still full of suspicion. So indeed, it’s normal for some decisions that leaders make to not be understood. But we still have to persist in doing them. In fact, to be honest, our national leaders are now strongly promoting traditional Chinese culture, but how many people don’t understand him? Many. So we have to be of one mind with President Xi and the national leaders, working together to do our best for the future of our country and our people, and fulfill our duty.

Alright, let's reflect on how the skewing of modern people’s thinking has resulted in all kinds of disasters. Disasters from our own bodies: cancer, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, including osteoporosis, and immune system diseases like lupus, these immune system diseases are becoming more and more common and people are getting sick at younger ages. We’ve heard of eighteen year olds suffering strokes and dying, these things are becoming more and more serious. When the body has problems, then so does the mind. Around the world, someone commits suicide every forty seconds. Depression and bipolar disorder; there are many people who suffer from these mental illnesses.

These are issues of individual mind and body, which extend to the family. Within the family, three of the five basic relationships are problematic. Spouses: the divorce rate is very high. Parents and children: there are fewer and fewer people who know how to be filial to their parents. Of course it’s commendable that the state is protecting filial piety, by establishing the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly. Many countries do not have such laws because in their cultures, they still lack the concept of filial piety, and education on filial piety. And in fact, to save this world, only filial piety can save it, because the ancestors said, "Of all virtues, filial piety is the greatest." If even the root, the most important and first virtue is missing, then how can we talk about the rest? We’ll analyze later that the root of all suffering lies in the lack of education in filial piety. In families: the divorce rate is getting higher and higher; conflicts between parents and children; and more and more siblings suing each other in court. This would have been seen as laughable in the past, but modern people don’t understand it anymore.

During the Ming Dynasty, there was a very loyal minister named Yang Jiaoshan. He was framed by Yan Song, a very treacherous official. Before he was executed, he was in prison and very calm, resigned to his fate. He had fulfilled his loyalty, and he had a clear conscience. The day before his death, he wrote a letter to his family, which is included in the *Five Kinds of Posthumous Writings*. In the letter he said, if either of my two sons sues his brother, and takes the case to the local magistrate, if the magistrate gets hold of this letter, I want you to punish the son who takes his brother to court. You must punish him severely. He understood very well; how can brothers sue each other in court? Wouldn’t that be the end of the family?

*Zhu Zi's Family Maxims* states, “At home, avoid litigation.” What must families refrain from? From suing each other. “Litigation will ultimately lead to misfortune.” If there is litigation, then the family is definitely in decline. I ask everyone, of all your friends and relatives, has anyone become prosperous after their close brothers sued each other? Please raise your hand. Have you ever observed that? It’s clear that doing this doesn’t lead to prosperity, so why are so many families suing each other now? No one is reminding them, no one is telling them this principle, they just keep fighting with each other, and waste so much money on lawyer fees. And in the end? What goes on above is emulated below, the next generation will be even worse. So the ancients said that the love between brothers should be a good example for their children and grandchildren, not bad examples by elders for their children. But people don’t understand this. In Penang, Malaysia, an island in the north of Malaysia, there is a large businessman who had been in a lawsuit with his brothers for a long time. But after learning *Di Zi Gui*, he stopped the litigation. He finally understood, who is suffering the most? His mother was suffering the most. He had failed in his filial piety. So he quickly repented and stopped the litigation, and his business has been thriving ever since.

There is also the important issue of elder care within families. One of the most important virtues of our Chinese people is respect for the elderly. This tradition has been passed down from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties for thousands of years, but this aspect isn't done well now. We need to understand that elders have devoted their entire lives to the family and to society, so not respecting elders is ingratitude. Without elders, where would the children and grandchildren come from? Without the efforts of the elderly, how would we have modern day achievements? Moreover, elders have very rich life wisdom and experience, so those who respect elders can inherit this invaluable wisdom and experience. And when people get old, it is the result of cultivating good karma, and those who are able to live long lives are worthy of our respect.

So, there are three main types of “fields of merit” for people, and we can teach this to our children. Fields of gratitude, fields of respect, and fields of compassion. We are grateful to our elders for their lifelong contributions, we remember their kindness. We respect elders, to inherit their wisdom and experience. A person who makes friends who are much older than them, even twice as old as them, will certainly be more mature than their peers. Everyone can observe this closely. So, a respectful heart brings great blessings. Arrogance and disrespect for elders greatly diminish one’s blessings.

During the Tang dynasty, there was a scholar named Yang Danian. He passed the imperial exam at the age of twenty, becoming the top scholar. To have become the top scholar at age twenty means his blessings and intelligence were extraordinary. But he had a habit of arrogance. Confucius was highly critical of arrogance. He said, “Even if a person possesses the talent and beauty of the Duke of Zhou,” – he had the talent of the Duke of Zhou and the ability to accomplish tasks that he did, which was the highest praise because Confucius admired the Duke of Zhou more than anyone, the one who created the rites and music, and established the eight hundred year Zhou Dynasty - but “if that person is arrogant and stingy,” if he is arrogant and unwilling to share his experience with others, “then the rest is not worth mentioning.” Then that person’s talent will be limited, and they will not progress. And if you really make use of such a person, their arrogance will lead to disharmony, they’ll make a mess everywhere, such people cannot be used, and their talent isn’t anything special.

So, "The success of any endeavor," all success, "is founded on respect." Respect for others, respect for the task. "And its failure," why does it fail? "Is based on arrogance." If they become arrogant. If you look closely, why do so many large companies fall so quickly? It’s because the person in charge, after achieving some success, thinks he is invincible, thinks he knows everything, and then makes a wrong decision, invest in another field, and it collapses. So people can’t become arrogant just because they’ve had some success. So, the ancestors also reminded us, “A clever child may not necessarily be great as an adult," and "early success at a young age is a great misfortune." If you have a little success when you’re too young, and you become too arrogant, you might suffer a great setback.

So, the criticism of arrogance, we can share these stories with our children. Yang Danian was twenty years old, and the top scholar in the entire country. Later, he entered the National Academy and was with these older people, and he often ridiculed others, making fun of them. These ministers were very frustrated, and they said to him, “Young man, one day you’ll be old too.” This statement tells us that you reap what you sow. If we respect elders today, we will be respected when we are old. If we don’t respect elders today, then when we are old no one will respect us. Cause and effect. So they warned him that he would get old too, but he didn’t change. So he died before he was fifty years old, perhaps in his forties. A person with such great blessings died in his forties. His disrespect consumed all of his blessings.

Conversely, there was another person named Wang Bin. Since he was a child he was weak and sickly, and he very much envied those who were healthy and long lived. Whenever an elder passed by his house, he would be very happy. These elders were long-lived people who had blessings and were cultivated, so he would invite them in to have some tea, or he would bow and greet them respectfully. Later, he lived to the age of ninety-three. From a young age he was short lived and sickly, but because of his respect, he cultivated many blessings, and lived to ninety-three. This is a field of respect. So respecting and loving elders fulfills both the fields of gratitude and respect.

Moreover, always think of elders, "Keep them warm in winter, and cool in summer." Show concern for elders and care for them. Elders, as they get older they become like children, and their lives need more understanding. For example, when eating, do not rush the elderly when they’re eating. So when you’re eating with an elder, don’t eat too quickly. If you finish eating and they feel they are slow, they’ll feel pressured. Be considerate. First, when eating with elders, eat slowly and calmly. Also, do not give elders cold food, which is bad for their stomachs, and should be warm. Also, don’t give elders hard food, it should be soft. "Slow, warm, and soft." Being so considerate to elders, that is also loving. So caring for elders, fulfills all three fields of merit. And now, the issue of elder care is very important in our country. There are so many elders who worked hard their whole life, but are abandoned by their children.

Then, there is also the issue of raising children. "Of the three forms of unfilial behavior, not having descendants is the greatest." Within a family, the most important thing is to care for the elders, and to raise the next generation well, so that families and society have talented people. But now in raising children, juvenile delinquency rates are also rising. These are all phenomena. These are family problems.

In society, there is the emergence of unsafe food, abortion, as well as fraud, unemployment rates, and crime rates. These are all connected to the human heart. Worldwide, there are 50 million registered abortions each year. This is more devastating than any world war, and it involves killing one's own flesh and blood.

If we extend this to global issues, there are now floods, typhoons, earthquakes, landslides, have you noticed how suddenly there are large sinkholes, where everything just collapses into it? These frequencies are increasing.

These are the chaotic phenomena that humanity is facing, from mind and body to the entire world, and this is the current suffering of humankind.


Okay, here is a professional-level translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and readability in English:

**Where Does the Root of Suffering Lie?**

We must identify the underlying cause of our problems to apply the correct remedy. While the symptoms may appear complex, the fundamental solutions can be found in the wisdom of our ancestors, in just a few simple words. Where do all these complex phenomena originate? Mencius said, "When those above and those below contend for gain, the nation is in danger, and so is the family." Mencius also said, "When one is well-fed and warmly clothed,"  if a person has enough to eat and wear, and “lives at ease without being taught”, without a proper sense of life's purpose or responsibility to family and parents, and instead idles away their time, like many college graduates who don't look for work but play computer games, if they "live at ease without being taught," without being guided on how to be a good person, "they are akin to beasts." Therefore, “sages worry about this," and teach the five cardinal relationships. Now, without moral teachings and with so much material enjoyment, people are "akin to beasts." What are beasts? Their desires are strong. And what is desire like? An abyss. You see, these few words from Mencius have identified the root of the problem: self-interest.

All of the issues we face stem from these two words: self-interest. Human hearts, driven by self-interest, have given rise to these chaotic situations. Let's analyze where these modern ailments come from. "Sickness enters through the mouth." Today, our food is filled with pesticides, fertilizers, hormones, and antibiotics, and loaded with chemical additives. What are these merchants doing it for? Profit – they are earning money without conscience. So now, one must be very cautious when eating to avoid harming oneself. Even the genetically modified foods of today are all for profit, but they may potentially affect the survival of future generations because these genetic modifications go against nature. We now see the phenomenon of increasing infertility. This connection deserves serious attention. We must follow the natural way; disrupting nature for self-interest can lead to severe consequences.

Therefore, Confucius said, "He who first made the burial figures, will he not have no posterity?”  *Yong* were burial figurines, and the fact they were made too realistic was a problem. Confucius was warning that because they were made so lifelike, people might later begin burying live humans with the dead. Therefore, one must bear the consequences for such a practice or bad precedent. Making figurines too realistic could result in having no descendants. Thus, when people do things today that could harm the future of humankind, they must bear a huge responsibility. Let’s consider this: If you run, for example, an video game arcade, and do not follow the rules, allowing countless underage children to become lost in that world, and some of them even die in these places from exhaustion after three or four days, you shouldn’t earn that kind of money. You are causing these young people to become mentally unstable. How can we expect our descendants to be healthy? “A gentleman loves wealth, but acquires it by proper means.” If you make a living by harming other’s lives, you and your family will most certainly face problems. These consequences are observable all around us, if you pay attention. What goes out comes back. When you kill or harm others, the consequences of those actions will eventually come back to you.

Humans have been spraying pesticides to kill countless insects. Think, which animal consumes the most pesticides? In Taiwan many years ago, statistics showed that on average, every person drank 2.7 kilograms of pesticides per year. Imagine there is a 2.7 kg container of pesticide in front of me, if I pick it up and say, “Cheers,” I would surely die. So now, we are all slowly being poisoned. Why are there so many illnesses? It's because of this. Has this situation strayed from self-interest? No.

What about our minds? Yesterday we talked about how children laugh 180 times a day, while adults only laugh about seven times on average. Why is that? It’s because they have made their life’s purpose about indulgence and pleasure. As a result, they become greedy, and the more they chase, the greater their suffering. In short, they suffer from “not getting what they seek." Everyone thinks they should satisfy their own desires, but they don't realize that our ancestors told us that desire is like an abyss, bottomless. Look at gamblers – what do they always say? "This is the last time." Look at women buying expensive clothes – they also say, "This is the last time."

And you must understand that these people who indulge in their desires are very likely building their enjoyment on the suffering of their loved ones. Today, so many young people are ignorant. A young man from a farming family attends university, and then he takes his girlfriend out to dinner for Valentine’s Day. Those couple hundred dollars are actually his parents’ hard-earned money. An older person once told me that he used to observe how his girlfriend would only eat a little, thinking she was easy to care for, so he married her. However, after marriage, he "woke up" to realize that meals were inexpensive, but clothes were very expensive. He had to accompany his wife to department stores, and when she stood in front of a designer dress, mesmerized, thinking "how wonderful!”, his heart would begin to pound. "Let’s go, let's go," he'd say, otherwise when she says "I want to buy it", with one swipe of the credit card, half of his salary would be gone. Isn't this wife's happiness built upon her husband's suffering? This is not right.

Now, let’s continue to think. How long does the joy of buying a new piece of clothing last? Isn't it worth thinking about whether spending all that money actually brings us happiness? Based on my informal survey, for example, someone who cares very much about showing off her new clothes might buy something and then immediately wear it to the office the next day, walking like a model, hoping to be noticed. After walking around for a long time without anyone noticing, she gets really angry, and finally can't help but go up to a colleague and say, "Do you notice anything different about me today?"  This particular colleague, who is a bit dense, says, "Hmm? Not really." So, not only is she not happy, she becomes furious. This is because her happiness is based on other people's opinions, which can easily turn from happiness into suffering. Moreover, many people who want to show off a new outfit the first time, don't dare wear it again because they are afraid of being told that they wore it before, it’s out of style, or being laughed at. These people are too superficial and not composed. Why? If someone laughs, they're laughing at themselves, not at us! What's the big deal?

So, for the sake of vanity, people are torturing themselves. And let me tell you, it’s not just themselves – they’re turning their entire families upside down. For example, parents constantly compare their children's grades, saying things like, "You embarrass me every day; you’re going to be the death of me." The children become pale and thin from studying so hard. Why? It's the parents’ desires and self-interest that they are imposing on their children, the drive to compete. Those in the teaching profession especially tend to compare children.

I can relate to this from my own experience. When I was in fourth grade, my mother was transferred to our school.  So, in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, my mother was often with her colleagues, and they were very competitive about their children's grades. My grades in elementary school were in the teens or twenties, average, sometimes even worse.  But my mother never compared me to others. I felt that she wasn't seeking that kind of vanity. Instead, they demonstrated to us a far more important and beneficial habit: leading by example.  We never watched TV after dinner. After taking a short break, my parents would start reading, so I gradually developed a habit of reading as well.

My older sister was always number one in the school, in elementary school and middle school.  So every time after the exams, the award ceremony was the time I dreaded most.  “Sixth grade first place," they would announce my sister's name, and I would quickly lower my head.  My classmates would say, "Your sister, your sister." You have to understand, having a sibling with good grades can also be difficult. But my parents never compared me to my sister because everyone has different talents, and everyone "blossoms" at a different time. We should believe that "at birth, human nature is good."

I remember when I was in high school, my elementary school science teacher came to our school, and I was so happy to welcome him.  My science teacher and my homeroom teacher both visited our school, and the three of us sat down together.  Both of these teachers had taught both my sister and me.  Then, my science teacher said to me, "Lixu, you are what we call (using a local dialect), 'a big chicken that crows late.'" Because a large chicken needs one or two seconds longer to take a breath than a regular chicken before it can “cock-a-doodle-doo." That is, a metaphor for “late bloomer.”  I was in high school when the teacher said this, and it really encouraged me. I felt that I couldn’t let my teacher down, and I slowly learned how to be independent and self-reliant.

So, don't seek vanity; don't pressure your children.  Always trust them. My father was the same way. Every time I didn’t do well on an exam, I felt guilty and would wait for him at the bottom of the stairs. Before he even came up the stairs, I would say, "Dad, I didn't do well on my exam." Each time my father would smile and say, "Keep trying."  My parents had good reading habits, creating a positive environment, so gradually, we children improved. One school principal once said that if you put an egg in salty water, what will happen? It will float, of course. What will happen if you put it in sugary water? No need to rush!  What has become of education now?  It is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, striving for quick success, which only puts pressure on students and makes them hate studying.  It is counterproductive. So, we must not be hasty, and not rush things. Mencius’s words are so important: Don’t pull up seedlings to help them grow.

The mental issues we see are indeed caused by our inability to satisfy our desires, which leads to suffering. Many people commit suicide when they are taking risks to satisfy their desires, and can no longer handle the situation. And many people who are obsessed with fame and fortune put so much pressure on those around them, leading to mental illness and even suicide. A top scientist in China committed suicide because his wife was so vain, constantly comparing him to other professors. “Their house is so many square meters, their income is so much…” Ultimately, her husband became distraught and took his own life. It is still about self-interest.

Also, why is the divorce rate so high? Either it is for profit – betraying principles for gain – or because of the inability to control desires, which results in families breaking apart. Why don't children respect their parents, abandoning the elderly? Because they are selfish, only satisfying their own desires, forgetting about their duties to be filial. Even with siblings, it is self-interest that causes conflicts. And why is children's education neglected? Because the parents are all busy making money. So now, there are about 50 to 60 million "left-behind children," which is heartbreaking.

There’s a story that gives us much to reflect on. In Zhuzhou, Hunan Province, there was a married couple who were both college graduates with stable jobs. However, when they saw others making a lot of money by opening factories and businesses, they couldn't resist. They quit their stable jobs and started their own business and factory. They did indeed make some money but neglected their son's education. In his childhood and youth, their son was often left alone with only the keys to his house, parents not being home. Where did he go? To the arcades and gaming venues. As he grew older, in his twenties, he developed a gambling problem, and used the property deeds for their house and factory to obtain loans, losing everything. His parents, in their sixties, lost everything they had worked for in a single night, and their son ran away to Guangdong to avoid his debts. Unable to cope with such an outcome, the couple drank pesticide and committed suicide at their ancestral graves last Mid-Autumn Festival. This happened very recently.

I think this story will prompt all parents to reflect.  At the very least, there are three key points for reflection.  First, does going into business and making money necessarily mean you will earn more? You must realize that the industry you are in is a matter of fate. The real reason is whether you have given, whether you have accumulated merit.  If that fortune belongs to you, it will find its way to you.  Why must you desperately try to grab as much money as possible? If that fortune is meant for you, no one can take it away. Why do people’s hearts feel uneasy? They don’t understand the true nature of wealth in a person’s life. When they see others become wealthy, they become restless and want to compete.  “If it’s meant to be, it will be.”  Don’t rush. “If it’s not meant to be, don’t force it.” You can work on improving yourself.  Like Mr. Liao Fan, who was not meant to have any children, when he stopped bad deeds and started doing good, he did have offspring.  He was not supposed to pass the imperial exams, but he eventually did and also became a county magistrate.  And though he was only supposed to live until 53, he ended up living until 74, adding 21 years to his life.  Destiny can be changed. The couple from Hunan, in pursuit of money, did not understand that the true way to wealth is through giving, accumulating good deeds and merit. They gave up their stable jobs for this. This is the first point: People do not understand wealth and their hearts are uneasy.

The Chinese God of Wealth is Tao Zhu Gong, who helped the King of Yue to restore his kingdom during the Spring and Autumn Period. After that, he left the king and went into business with his wife, Xi Shi, in a certain place. He became wealthy very quickly, and then he gave away all of his wealth to the poor and started again with a small business. Soon, he became very wealthy again and gave it all away again. Historical records show that he accumulated wealth three times and dispersed it three times. He understood that the true path to wealth is through giving. Your work is a matter of fate, and with the right causes and conditions, wealth will be the eventual outcome. So many people don’t understand these principles and their hearts are uneasy. Understanding the truth leads to a peaceful heart.

The second key point is that you should not neglect the most important thing in life, which is teaching your children, for the sake of making money. If you forget the most important things, and fail in your duties as a human being, how can you expect to be blessed? The *Book of Changes* tells us that "benefit is the harmony of righteousness." When we look at “profit,” are we talking about small, short-term gains, or lasting, long-term benefits? For long-term gains, we cannot be shortsighted or seek immediate profit, which will be like licking honey from a knife’s blade and cutting off your tongue. The true meaning of profit in *Book of Changes* corresponds to righteousness and harmony. You must focus on your duties and obligations as a human being and manage it in a harmonious way, that "righteousness will be in balance." This "balance" means things are arranged in a very fitting way. Today, for the sake of making money, people neglect their parents, neglect their children's education and have failed in their duties, failing to organize their lives, which creates an imbalance that will certainly lead to problems. This is the second key point: that they neglected their children's education, and ended up losing everything. Like the story I shared earlier about a man who had 2 billion dollars, because of a stroke and less than a year later, his two sons and grandsons squandered it all away.

The third point is that even when all your wealth is gone, is suicide the only solution? You should not give up but face your challenges with courage. Suicide is the most unfilial act you can commit. Aren’t you having the older generation send off the younger generation?

There was an entrepreneur in Taiwan who also made a mistake. He saw others making money in another industry, and he invested in that, quickly losing 3 billion dollars. His family and friends urged him to run away overseas to avoid paying back the money, but he said, "I'd rather be the poorest person who keeps their promises." He had made a mistake but what he did was commendable: he upheld “integrity as the foundation of his business." A while later, an opportunity arose in mainland China. Although he had no money, people were willing to loan him money because of his integrity. He said that his ticket to developing his business in China cost him 3 billion dollars, that ticket was a lesson he learnt, and he went back to his original business, which now is several times more successful in China than in Taiwan. So, he had been reduced to nothing, but he had ambition. He tried his best to find a solution, he didn’t give up, and he has rebuilt his success. This story makes us reflect on the importance of educating the next generation.

Let's continue to look at societal problems. Abortion is driven by desire. Hospitals perform abortions for profit. What about tainted food? Is that not also driven by profit, earning money without conscience? And fraud? Is that not all for the sake of money? Or how about young people who are indulgent and wasteful? When they run out of money, they begin to do wrong.  Are there not many young people who are spending lavishly and end up going after their parents’ retirement money? All of this is related to self-interest. Again, the human heart is driven by self-interest, when they do not do good, they will naturally invite disaster.

Now that we have analyzed all of this, let me ask you, can anyone raise their hand to guarantee that their students will not get cancer? Can anyone raise their hand to guarantee that their students will not have mental illness? Can anyone raise their hand to guarantee that their students will not get divorced? Can anyone raise their hand to guarantee that their students will be filial to their parents? These questions are very important. Today, teachers often talk about how many of their students get master’s degrees or PhDs. But, have those students divorced? Are they filial to their parents?  Aren’t these more important than academic degrees? They are far more important. In fact, academic degrees don't necessarily directly correlate to success. Moreover, these master's or PhDs can create an "aura" that makes them feel superior to others, leading to arrogance. If any of the aforementioned issues apply to their life, they are unlikely to be happy. Can anyone raise their hand to guarantee that your female students will not have abortions, or that your male students will not hurt girls? If you are guiding your children with ideas of self-interest and desire, their lives will inevitably face such problems. But, by changing their mindset, children can avoid these disasters.

If we reflect carefully, we may very well be guiding our children in this way, if we do not deeply understand the classics of traditional Chinese culture. Today, many kindergartens overseas teach children to compete. Isn't competition just another form of selfishness?  It’s obvious. Our traditional culture sees the signs from the smallest things.  If a person is self-centered, their development is driven by self-interest. If we make this more explicit, they are being selfish and self-serving.  And this becomes competition. Now, we're even teaching children in kindergarten to compete.  If we look at the classics, did Confucius teach us to compete? When people compete, all sorts of chaos arise. “A gentleman does not compete.” What is meant to be yours is yours. There is no need to compete for it.  “If there is no alternative, they compete at archery," When there's no competition, they would then just take part in archery and at the end of the competition, they would say, “You honor me," and they would have a drink together. They did not encourage this competitive attitude in life. Once there is competition, who do they end up competing with? Their parents and siblings. A book once asked, "Should we raise our children to be wolves or sheep?"  Dear principals and colleagues in the education field, should we raise our children to be wolves or sheep? No, we should raise them to be human beings. So these discussions show us that people have lost their self-confidence. Instead of being good people, they want to become wolves or sheep. They should be humans, the spirit of all beings. Competition then escalates to conflict, and conflict then escalates to war. There are so many wars taking place in the world every day. What is next after war? Nuclear weapons now have the power to destroy the Earth many times over. That battle cannot be fought. That would be the end of the world.

Moreover, we should understand that there are terrorists now.  And these aren't just international terrorists, if we don't teach our children well, then the terrorists could be in your very own home. Isn’t that true? They could squander all your wealth. Self-interest is a dead end. Yet, how many people in the world are heading down this path? Desires, thinking that the meaning of life is about pleasure. That is a great mistake. *The Great Learning* tells us that life should be about principles: “The Way of Great Learning consists in clearly manifesting luminous virtue, in loving the people, and in resting in the highest good." This is the purpose of life, not pleasure.

But let's not point fingers at others. When I graduated from university, I also pursued this idea – no one had taught me differently. I thought that quickly living in a large house and driving a luxury car was enjoying life. But actually, the more you indulge, the more empty you become. If a child is raised in heaven where they get whatever they ask for, that is called spoiling. Let's all think about it, aren't children today extremely spoiled? Nobody thinks of the elderly people’s birthday, and children's birthdays are the most important.  We say “happy birthday”. What does "happy birthday” mean for elderly people? It is a blessing for long life. What is the meaning of “happy birthday" for 3, 5, or 8 year olds? You are not adding time, but taking it away. “Happy birthday” is really a way of expressing gratitude to someone who has made contributions to family or society.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text from Chinese into English. I have aimed for a balance between accuracy, natural flow, and capturing the tone of the speaker, which seems to be a blend of lecturing and personal reflection.

**Translation:**

Celebrating children before they’ve contributed to the family, or to society, is actually diminishing their good fortune. You even invite a bunch of classmates, which makes things even more backward. The world is upside down these days.  When we go out, who do we ask where to go – the elderly or the kids? We ask the kids.  Where to? A children's amusement park! And what do you find in these parks?  Kids jumping all over the place, leaping from high places, screaming bloody murder.

One year, I took my graduating class on a trip.  I spent the entire time talking about the beauty of nature,  the cultural and educational value of the places we could visit.  After all that, I said, "Okay, where do you want to go?"  They all yelled, "The amusement park!"  I couldn’t budge them, and ended up there. Watching them shriek and yell, I wondered, “Is this really happiness?” Finally, I realized I needed to experience it for myself to understand. So, I chose that ride that holds maybe two or three people, going up, down, and all around.  After getting off, I was completely disoriented. My first thought was, “I’m going to throw up!” I thought, “What kind of existence is this, ‘finding pleasure in suffering’?” These kinds of extreme activities are not good for your body.  They offer a brief moment of escape, a “drink today, forget tomorrow” mentality. But in the end, you destroy your health and you still have to face your problems. So, we shouldn't drink; instead, we should read the *Di Zi Gui*. Understanding principles brings inner peace; otherwise, how can you have peace? If you don’t understand principles, you make mistakes every day and create a mountain of problems to worry about.  Therefore, the most important thing in life is to learn and gain wisdom, “To be eager to learn is akin to knowledge.”

Our values are wrong; we think enjoying ourselves is the meaning of life.  Children these days live like they're in heaven. They eat expensive things, take a few bites, and throw the rest away. What a waste! It’s shocking to see at the universities; half of the food in the dining halls gets thrown away. That diminishes their fortune. University students even have the attitude that leaving food is a point of pride. "It shows my family is rich!" How misguided is that?

We are so grateful that President Xi is taking the lead in promoting thrift and honesty. When I heard about it, I immediately thought of a line from the *Book of Songs*: “A true leader is the people’s blessing,” the true support of the people. And "Social unrest will be quickly resolved."  "Shu" means “probably”, and “chuan” means “quickly." Because leaders are setting the example, we have this “Clean Plate Campaign” to stop wasting food. People are beginning to practice thrift and be less extravagant. With President Xi taking the lead, how much money do you think China is saving every day? It’s extraordinary. As these habits take hold, the entire nation benefits.  So, a true leader is indeed the people’s blessing.

And this true leader isn’t just the president, who else is it? A school principal, a teacher, a homeroom advisor. If your thoughts and beliefs are correct, many children will change for the better and the troubles in their homes will be resolved. If you turn a wayward child around, their parents and elders will burn incense and pray to bless that teacher, who has changed the fate of their entire family.

But if we indulge children from a young age, they will spend money recklessly and develop bad habits. Our ancestors reminded us, "It’s easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but hard to go back." They'll never break that cycle. They spend money even before they earn it, leading to what? A lot of debt! When they get to the workplace, they need to indulge themselves so they are racking up more bank loans. If they lose their jobs, those things will be taken away from them. Suddenly everyone is a competitor, because they cannot afford to lose their jobs. They see everyone as an opponent, and it's exhausting, this dog-eat-dog world.

If you look at it carefully, how many credit cards does the average university student have these days? Several, right? I think this era is completely upside down. People haven't even earned any money, yet they know how to spend it. What kind of credit is that? Does that make sense? It’s already illogical for someone who doesn't know how to earn money to know how to spend it; what’s the use of a credit card? A truly credible person is someone who lives within their means, and they are the ones who deserve trust. So businesspeople need to think carefully. These credit cards awaken students' desires and drain all of their parents' hard-earned money. Many college students spend recklessly and are called "the freeloader generation," freeloading off their parents' hard work. And there are "white-collar freeloaders," who live off their parents' salaries. There are also "moonlight goddesses," who spend all their money each month. They spend so much money and then go back to their parents: "Dad, I'm out of money."  What’s a young woman with accounting skills using them for? She uses them to figure out how to spend all her money by the end of the month, having no concept of savings. Sometimes she is very precise in her calculations but can't resist temptation, and for the last few days, she has to eat instant noodles. When she runs out of money and can’t bear it, she asks her dad, "Dad, I'm broke." And he gets angry, saying, “How many times have I told you, but you never listen! How much do you want?” This is a case of “if only I had known earlier.” Education should start early, or else habits will become ingrained, and no matter how much you cry out, no one will hear you.

They chase after these desires, and work becomes a battlefield, without any real happiness. Have you ever seen people in a big city at night, sitting with a fan, sipping old wine, and eating peanuts, enjoying the moonlight? Have you ever seen that? That’s a life of leisure and contentment. People today don’t know how to enjoy life; they rush and rush, busy and busy, exhausted to the point of collapse. It's a battlefield.

And what about when they are old? They haven't raised their children well, so their children aren't filial. They're left to be cared for in nursing homes, waiting to die.  That’s how it is in many so-called civilized or developed nations.  “Civilized” countries should be those that best understand how to live a good life; instead, civilization is equated with material enjoyment. That’s not right, that is misguided.  The more civilized a country is, the less it takes care of its elderly. What kind of civilization is that? The more civilized countries are spending whose money? The money of future generations. If you look at the public debt issued by democracies, it is being paid for by the second and third generations; what kind of civilization is that? They don't take care of their children; their children don’t know how to be grateful. In their old age, they end up in nursing homes, waiting to die. That’s not a pleasant feeling. When two or three hundred people live together, and suddenly number two hundred leaves, number three hundred leaves, number one hundred fifty-two leaves, you’re going to feel nervous; when will it be my turn?

Frankly, people are all the same. When foreigners see a filial son, they will also feel envious. There was a foreign old woman who wrote in her will that her ashes should be poured on top of the mall across the street from her house. The owner certainly didn't agree to that. Why? Because she had four children who often went to the mall but refused to visit her. Imagine that poor old woman's agony as she saw her children visit the mall but refused to come see her.  In her last moments, she felt such regret, she wanted her ashes to be poured on the roof of that mall, because that's where her children would go. So pitiful. That path we shouldn’t walk. Greed is wrong, desire takes this route, and profit takes that route.

We must follow our ancestors' teachings, and transform our mindset about life and what we seek, not pursuing greed or desire, but pursuing righteousness and a life of hard work and frugality.  Where does righteousness start?  Filial piety; our parents have shown us the greatest kindness. With filial piety in our hearts, Confucius told us in the *Analects*, "Filial piety and brotherly love are the root of benevolence!"  Once a person’s heart is filled with filial piety and brotherly love, brotherly love will stem from filial piety. "Be kind to your elder brothers, be respectful to your younger brothers. When brothers are harmonious, filial piety is within them." Really, once filial piety blossoms, all good qualities will blossom. We will analyze this for you later; filial piety is the great foundation of education.  Confucius said in the *Classic of Filial Piety*, "Filial piety is the root of virtue, the source from which education arises." Education must start from this point, without teaching filial piety, you cannot talk about education. What is “yu” (育, to educate)? *Shuowen Jiezi* tells us, “It means to raise a child and make him do good”. You must raise that child into a good person, and of all good actions, filial piety comes first. Without teaching filial piety, it can’t be called education. If you focus on making them good at exams, you are simply passing on knowledge, you are not teaching them how to be a good person, and that’s not education.

When the heart of filial piety is awakened, it leads to benevolence, to understanding how to help each other. “We do not care only for our own parents and children,” and we will eventually achieve the ideal of a harmonious world, as described by our ancestors.  Mutual support is not far from us. I remember when I was little, in Taiwan, there was still a strong traditional cultural atmosphere. It has declined significantly in our generation. At that time, there was a strong sense of human connection. If a neighbor was going out shopping, they’d always ask, “Do you need anything?” They’d help each other out. They’d give money, saying, “Oh, it's nothing, we'll talk about it later.” They were very polite to each other and considerate of each other. If one family cooked something delicious, everyone around them would get some. If one family celebrated an event, the whole street would come to help, do you remember? It’s not that far from us. I remember when I was little, I was a flower girl. At that time, you felt that the entire street was like one big family, helping each other. Even at funerals, if an old person from the neighborhood passed away, we’d all go and pay our respects. So, mutual support, a harmonious world, isn't that a righteous life, which begins with filial piety? A happy and fulfilling life. This is the opposite of a life driven by greed, or a life indulging in desires; instead, we should choose a life of diligence and frugality.

Our entire traditional education first teaches children to cultivate blessings and to avoid indulging desires. When they were little, children would understand the concept of giving way, like Kong Rong giving pears. If they had something good, they would give it to their parents and elders. And because they grew up in large families with two or three hundred members, from a young age, parents would guide their children. For example, a mother might say, “You need to think of your father, your brothers and sisters, your entire family.” Children wouldn't be selfish. If a person always thinks of others, they will be blessed. And because they have a sense of responsibility to the family from a young age, they also have a sense of mission to bring honor to their family. This becomes a never-ending source of motivation in their lives, and being filial becomes a never-ending source of motivation. If you look at it carefully, my father’s generation had filial piety; their parents didn’t have to worry about their studies or careers. I never saw my grandparents ever worry about my father. When he started a family, he and his wife lived harmoniously and their children were raised well, without causing my grandparents any worry. This is righteousness, and it is rooted in thinking of parents from a young age.

Furthermore, with this mindset, their studies are about increasing their abilities, learning for the benefit of the world.  “I must have the skills, wisdom, and knowledge to help society.” No matter what industry they are in, they will be working to benefit others. And when they reach old age, they will have accumulated a wealth of good fortune. They will live a blessed life and enjoy the happiness of family. Not just their own children but their entire family will treat them with respect, and they can enjoy the happiness of family and enjoy good fortune. We should save our good fortune for our later years, for our final moments. Blessed people pass away peacefully, they simply say goodbye and go, without any suffering.

In fact, if someone follows this path in life, they will become wiser as they age, and the people around them will cherish them all the more. My mentor is eighty-seven years old. Wherever he goes, countless students will want to be near him, to ask him questions. Even national leaders seek his wisdom and knowledge in governing the country. So when a person has a sense of responsibility from a young age, their ability and wisdom will constantly accumulate and grow, making them more valuable as they grow older. This kind of life is truly joyful.

I have an elder, his surname is Lu, and his father named him Lu Mingxin. What a wonderful name. To "illuminate virtue" and "make the people new" are the most important values in the *Great Learning*, and his name encapsulates these values. He is very wise. By twenty-nine, he was already a professional general manager. When a company had problems, he would go in and resolve them in two or three years, saving the company from bankruptcy. He is extremely capable and wise. In his forties and fifties, the people who worked with him deeply admired his virtue and wisdom, wanting to learn from him.  Eventually, he was surrounded by a group of young people. If his own children wanted to spend time with their father, they had to schedule it.  His son would ask, “Dad, do you have any time tomorrow?” and his father would say, “I’m sorry, my schedule is full for this week. If you want to talk with me, you’ll need to make an appointment for the week after next." You see how wise this father is. His sons won't let him go, they even have to schedule time with him.  How valuable is a later life like that? Even on Father's Day, lots of people would show up and his own son would get jealous, saying, "He's my father!"

I believe that all of you have the good of the world at heart and treat all of China's children as your own, putting your heart and effort into teaching them. I believe we are very clear about where our fundamental beliefs have gone wrong. If we ourselves make the change, the teachers and students we lead will surely walk on the path of righteousness, hard work, and frugality.

That concludes our discussion for today. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Lecture 5: Establishing a Nation and Governing the People: Education First**

Respected leaders, principals, and colleagues in the field of education, good morning!

In our previous lecture, we discussed how the various conflicts and sufferings that humanity experiences, from the individual's body and mind to the family, society, and the world, all stem from flawed thinking. People believe that the pursuit of life should be driven by self-interest, but when everyone above and below vies for profit, the nation and the family are jeopardized. Moreover, desires are like an abyss. We should transform this mentality of pursuing self-interest into one of moral righteousness and diligence. Therefore, pain and happiness can often be determined in a single thought.

This single, correct thought pattern must be cultivated through education. So, let's think calmly: the problems we see today, from individual to family to societal issues, cannot necessarily be resolved with economic solutions. Nor can they be completely solved by political means, diplomacy, or various scientific methods. Take the legal system, for instance. Have you ever heard of a friend or relative who, after a court case, joyfully exclaimed, “Wow, that’s great! The verdict was so fair!”? You’ve never heard that, have you? When things have truly reached an impasse, people resort to lawsuits, but in the end, both sides still harbor resentment. "Even great reconciliation leaves lingering resentment," as Lao Tzu taught us. Furthermore, Lao Tzu said, "The more laws and regulations there are, the more robbers and thieves there will be." If you only address the symptoms, you can hardly resolve the fundamental problem. You might fix things temporarily, but it's difficult to improve the social climate in the long run. The United States has some of the most comprehensive legal systems in the world, yet its crime rate remains very high. When you try to control people with laws, they will find ways to circumvent them; their intelligence is used in the wrong ways.

Without the guidance of classic teachings, let’s consider: how much time has humanity spent researching systems and laws? We believe that these methods can solve problems, and we've expended countless human, material, and financial resources. We’ve put so much effort into political systems, but the reality is that systems are secondary; the foundation is a person’s moral character. No matter how good the system is, if the people lack virtue, will it not just produce a bunch of politicians who manipulate the system? If the people are good, even with an ordinary system, they can still govern the country well. Our sage kings, for example, lived humbly but dedicated themselves to improving the well-being of the people. So what is democracy? It’s constantly putting the people's happiness first; that's the essence of true democracy. We must grasp that true essence.

Confucius stated in “The Analects, Book II: On Governance,” “Lead them with policies and regulate them with punishments, and the people will avoid [wrongdoing] but have no sense of shame.” If we educate the next generation this way, their behavior will be different when their parents or teachers are around, and when they are not. Then the children we raise will be inconsistent inside and out. How can our nation have a bright future? Instead, we must "guide them with virtue," establish their life outlook based on moral principles, and "regulate them with rituals," using etiquette to cultivate them gradually and subconsciously. Then, "they will have shame and be reformed."  They will have a sense of shame, and "reformed" means that their hearts will be very sincere and upright. They will immediately correct themselves whenever they find they've made a mistake. This kind of mindset will surely receive divine protection, for we are part of the trinity of heaven, earth, and humankind.

One of my teachers said something that left a deep impression on me and pinpointed the world's problem: "The East does not emphasize ethics and moral education, and the West does not emphasize religious education. Without moral teaching, people do not understand principles, and this has led to the current chaos." The East emphasizes benevolence, while the West, having a tradition of the integration of church and state, has a stronger emphasis on universal love. Both of these are good intentions. However, because both East and West have neglected the fundamental wisdom of the sages, the problems we see today have arisen. Just as I mentioned yesterday, we are chasing after self-interest. Therefore, parents, leaders, and teachers must correct this way of thinking.

I previously shared the story of the child who ridiculed those without fathers, only to have his own father murdered by a thief later. But when he was young, he happily accepted and performed the service duties in his class.  From this, we can see that "At birth, people are by nature good.” Scientists have also conducted experiments that show even very young toddlers, when seeing an adult deliberately drop something, would wobble over and pick it up, then try to return the item to the adult. These all prove our inherent goodness. Children indeed possess innate benevolence. We’ve all seen three-year-olds. One day, someone brought a fish to a girl's grandfather, putting it in a basin. The fish was too big, its tail sticking out, so the tail was cut off, presumably while the fish was still alive. When the little girl saw this, she cried and kept saying, "It hurts, it hurts." So the ancients said, "All things are interconnected, this is called benevolence.” The child's natural instinct is still there; she could feel the animal's pain.

Have you ever seen two children playing when one suddenly trips and falls hard? The sound of the fall is loud, and the one behind starts crying. The one who fell isn't crying yet; he's still trying to understand what just happened. But the one behind cries first. Why? He has empathy; he feels the pain and begins to cry.  Then his mother comes over and says, "You didn't fall! Why are you crying? It's his pain, not yours!" Sometimes this is how we suppress children's natural instincts.  A father shared that when his child was two or three years old, he would cover his eyes when he saw violent scenes on TV, saying, "Mom, it's so scary, they're so pitiful," and he would cry. However, when that same child was in elementary school, his father saw him watching the same violent scenes, and shouting, “Kill, kill, kill!” Why was there such a huge difference in the same child?

Therefore, the first goal of our ancestral education was to allow an individual to maintain their inherent connection with their parents, that filial affection, throughout their entire life. This love for parents should be extended to loving siblings, family, neighbors, and all people. Finally, the idea is that, “All humans should be loved” and even all things.  Because “love your parents and then be benevolent to others,” filial piety is naturally inspired, and one extends it to loving everyone. Then, “being benevolent to others leads to love of all living things.” Someone who maintains their connection with their parents throughout their life will be the happiest person in the world. Look at a two- or three-year-old child when they see their parents. They're so happy, shouting "Mom!" from far away, then rushing over to hug her. Look at that child's smile. They are the happiest person in the world. How much money did it cost for that smile? Nothing, right? If we could maintain that kind of happiness throughout our lives, that would be true joy.

Zeng Zi maintained that connection with his parents throughout his entire life. When his friend came to visit, Zeng Zi’s mother, being kind, didn't want the visitor to wait, but Zeng Zi had gone up the mountain. In her haste, she bit her finger. Immediately, Zeng Zi's heart felt pain, and he rushed home to see if anything was wrong. This is our innate nature. I once saw a five-year-old boy perform the Three Kneelings and Nine Kowtows for his father.  He was crying the whole time. When we asked him afterwards why he was crying, he said, "I saw my father crying." The child was expressing his connection with his father, instantly sharing in his emotions. This is a child's natural feeling towards their parents.

Parents also have a natural feeling towards their children. I remember when my older sister was in postnatal confinement at our house. Every time the baby cried, she was the first to notice it. My mother and I were still trying to figure out what was happening, but my sister was already in the room. We hadn't even registered the sound yet. Where else is this especially evident? When children are learning to talk, around one year old, they'll talk to me for a long time, but I won't understand a single word. But the mother understands every word and even acts as a translator. Hasn’t every mother been a translator? So, is it words that are communicating or is it the hearts? If it were words, everyone would be able to understand. My Mandarin is not bad. So, it’s heart-to-heart communication. When I watched an episode of "All Parents Under Heaven," which featured director Zhai, I truly understood that he was the happiest person in the world. When he was asked what he thought happiness was, he replied, "When I open the door (he was over 60 years old) and call out 'Mom,' that's my greatest happiness." See? This over 60-year-old is saying the same thing as a two-year-old. "If I can hug my mother, I am the happiest.” He isn’t greedy for anything else.

Our ancestors deeply understood human nature. They knew that maintaining this innate connection is the greatest happiness, and that it should be extended as a love for all. If we educate our children so that they become increasingly distant, estranged, and even rebellious towards their parents, then that education is counterproductive. Therefore, we, as parents and leaders, must be very clear about the purpose of education.

Even those of us who are educators may not truly understand education. Some of the theories we encounter may even be flawed, like the experiments on dogs and cats I mentioned the other day. Any educational theory that is not checked against the classics of Confucius and the core values of Chinese culture cannot be guaranteed to be correct. Therefore, we must have a very important attitude when studying the teachings of the sages: "Follow the teachings, not the person." We should follow the classic texts, not be swayed just because we like what someone is saying. That's an emotional response. We must follow the classics and follow the truth.

While we are here learning traditional Chinese culture together, there is another gathering of 20,000 entrepreneurs somewhere else. Each person paid 20,000 yuan for a ticket. What are they learning? They are pursuing profit and desire.  They are spending 20,000 yuan to learn flawed thinking at the same time we are here. This means that we educators have a mission. How many of our compatriots are being misled right now? People are so pitiful; in this age, they listen to deception and ignore sincere advice; they accept falsehood and reject truth. They will pay large sums of money to hear wrong ideas, while the teachings of our ancestors are offered to us for free, and we throw them in the trash. Therefore, the most blessed people are those who are willing to be admonished. Who can one accept admonishment from? First of all, when one is young, they can accept their parents' words; that person will have good fortune. When they go to school, they respectfully listen to their teachers' teachings; that person has good fortune. When they enter society, they are able to listen to the experiences and guidance of their leaders; that person will avoid many detours. Especially when they are a child of China who is able to accept the teachings of their ancestors, that person is building their life on the wisdom of 5,000 years; their perspective and vision will certainly be different from others. Therefore, those of us engaged in education, as director Zhang Fa-Ting has famously said, must first be educated ourselves.  We must be good students, good students of the sages, before we can possibly be good teachers. This is the fundamental basis.

Earlier, I told you about that elementary school student who stopped volunteering for class duties because he was listening to his father. We need to understand that children in the first grade will often readily accept the words of their parents and teachers; they do not yet have the capacity to distinguish right from wrong. We who are in our twenties and thirties, who have studied the classics, are more capable of making judgments and can distinguish between the advice of friends and family. Children, however, cannot. As a result, from that day on, the child became self-centered, selfish, calculating, and unwilling to contribute. When a person is unwilling to contribute, they gradually become what? Calculating. They slowly become harsh. The heart changes like this, bit by bit, growing more and more distorted. Later, he ridiculed a classmate without a father, and two years later, his own father met with misfortune.

Let’s think calmly. Although his father was an educator, he did not know what a correct attitude towards life was. He taught his child selfishness, which resulted in a harsh child, and the fate of his family was ruined because of it.  If he had taught his child moral principles, the destiny of their entire family would be completely different. Therefore, it is critical that we get traditional culture into every household. This is more urgent than putting out a fire.

A friend once came to me, very saddened. He told me that a friend of his had asked him for a copy of the *Disciples’ Rules* and a DVD about traditional culture. That week, he was very busy, so he just said, “Okay, okay,” but did not give it to him right away. When he finally remembered many days later, that friend had committed suicide. Perhaps he was drowning, seeking a piece of driftwood, but it was not provided to him. And so, the opportunity was lost.

Just like when professor Liu Yu-Li from the Central Party School, in one of her lectures, mentioned Song Hong of the Eastern Han Dynasty who told Emperor Guangwu, "One should not forget the hardship of poverty, nor should one abandon the wife who has shared one's hardships." The original wife has toiled with you through thick and thin; how can one forget such shared affection? Therefore, he absolutely could not betray his wife. After he said these words, the emperor was moved, and all the officials were moved. At that time, I don't think anyone would dare to wrong their spouse, or else they would have been condemned by everyone. One person truly can lead the way in transforming the social climate.

In Jiangsu, there was an official whose department had an extremely high divorce rate before he took his post. After he arrived, he would often speak to his colleagues about the five fundamental relationships, especially focusing on the relationship between husband and wife. Also, his wife would often bring delicious dishes to the office. The colleagues were moved by how affectionate they were, and after he arrived, not a single couple got divorced.  The influence of leadership is very important. I believe that maybe some were considering divorce, but they were moved and reflected on their situation after seeing this positive example. I feel that this leader accumulated immense virtue; by preventing those couples from divorcing, their elders and ancestors are thankful to him.

After Professor Liu shared this story, an official went to her after class and bowed to her, saying "Thank you. I was about to wrong my wife, but after hearing this, I feel very ashamed. I was wrong,” and he quickly changed his course. So, delivering traditional culture to every household is even more urgent than putting out a fire. Look at that example of the school administrator who misguided his child.  Such a great misfortune befell their family because the education was flawed, leading to a loss of blessings.

Yesterday, we also discussed diligence and thrift. “Diligence and thrift are the foundation of a well-run home.” When we educate the next generation about marriage, we must teach them to choose someone whose primary characteristic is filial piety. A filial person is a loving person. Look at young people today: when they seek a partner, what do they look for? Do they look attractive? That’s unwise—valuing appearances over character. Or, do they look at whether or not the person has money? Those are all superficial things.  “Character is the root, and wealth is the branch.” Marrying a good wife can benefit three generations, right? Marrying a bad one can ruin everything, and it's impossible to recover. So, these judgments are extremely important. Especially for women, they must be diligent and thrifty to manage a household well.

Recently, I attended a conference at UNESCO, which gave me the opportunity to introduce Chinese culture and *The Imperial Readings of the Taizong Era*, which is a book of wisdom on governance compiled by Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty. It’s called *zhiyao*, which means "essential governance," the most important wisdom for ruling a country. What does this work include? It contains the teachings on self-cultivation, family management, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. The 500,000 words are very insightful.

After the conference, the next day we had a chance to visit a department store. I went to see the world, as they say. I heard that going to department stores is good for practicing mindfulness— remaining unmoved by all of the temptations.  So I went to the first floor, and I discovered something. The entire first floor was full of women's items. The first thing I saw was a handbag. I inquired about the price and found out it cost about 70,000 or 80,000 yuan! I almost fainted! That bag costs 70,000 or 80,000 yuan— you could buy a car with that money! Then I figured it was heaven's arrangement for me to gain experience. After walking just a few steps, I saw a woman having her hair done. They were combing it and blow-drying it up very high. There was also a designer there helping her. I estimated that having her hair done was very expensive. I remember when I went to Haikou to get my hair cut, it cost just three yuan. How much do you think she is paying for her hair? In addition, having her hair done takes several hours. And it is not just a few hours for today. How much time would she spend each day doing her hair and washing it? Let’s add all of that up. Let’s estimate how much time and money it costs. Let’s move down from the hair. She will have to trim her eyebrows; she has to draw them on. Then she has to curl her eyelashes. She has to put on eye cream, facial cream, lipstick, and lip balm. Then there are the earrings and necklaces. Just everything from the neck up is already a lot. Plus, the makeup. I don’t even know how much it costs and how much time it takes. I ask everyone, how much money and how much time is left for taking care of the family? So, going to a department store helps one to understand that diligence and thrift are indeed the foundation for a well-run home.

Especially now, there are many bad social trends. I’ve heard that women have to be “fair, wealthy, and beautiful.” They have to whiten their skin, have money, and be glamorous. The makeup is so thick—you could knock on their head and it would fall off. It’s really thick. There was a very wealthy woman in Guizhou. Her husband was very wealthy. She said her friends were all from that “fair, wealthy, and beautiful” category. They would endlessly compare themselves, and her heart was very empty. Later, she began studying traditional culture and realized she needed to pursue spiritual fulfillment. But it had already become a bad habit. Her four- or five-year-old daughter already knew all of the steps for putting on makeup; she could apply it herself.

Our ancestors had a very valuable spirit: they were always thinking of the world. As the saying goes, "Don't focus on the present, but on the future consequences. Don't focus on the moment, but on the long term. Don't focus on the individual, but on the world." The classics also say, "One word can make a nation rise, and one word can make it fall." Our every action and every word carries responsibility for the world. "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual." This is indeed the case. For example, I’ve really heard people say, “It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you can make money.” This is an irresponsible statement and corrupts the social climate.  “A gentleman loves wealth, but he acquires it through proper means.” Why would they speak like this? When many people hear this, they don't evaluate it. If everyone followed this idea, everything would be finished.

Just like we discussed yesterday, if we can transform self-interest to moral duty, then social problems will be resolved. This society used to be filled with human kindness and valued relationships. When did it become so focused on profit? When did it change? Who caused it to change? This is something worth considering. I observe that it is likely the result of everyone’s misguided thoughts and words in society. I remember when I was young, I often heard elders saying, “Oh, so-and-so’s son makes tens of thousands of yuan a month.” Or “Wow, so-and-so’s son went to medical school and now earns over a hundred thousand yuan a month.”


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity and accuracy while maintaining the original tone and flow:

**Translation:**

"I wonder, does the person who speaks like this contribute to the deterioration of social morals? What is most important for a doctor? Exactly, they’ve deviated from the path." “Oh, his child became a teacher, the income is not bad, a guaranteed job,” so, is becoming a teacher just to make money? Being a teacher is to cultivate talents for the nation! They all put profit first. Even when I became a teacher, an elder said, “Not bad, the monthly income is quite good.” I smiled at this elder and said, “Elder, you should remind me: you must cultivate talent for the country and society. Look at other people’s parents, their children are their precious treasures, and they trust you with them. You must teach them well; you must be worthy of the parents and worthy of society.” The elder said, “Yes, yes, what you said makes sense.” So, every word, whether it concerns oneself or the world, should be considered from a broader perspective.

In the past, women were very clear that being dignified set a good example for their children and society. Now, women are not dignified, they dress very revealingly, which is extremely negative for social morals. You tell me, if a woman dresses so revealingly in the office, how can her male colleagues concentrate on work? Isn’t it true? If they are gentlemen of integrity, they wouldn’t know where to look. Why? They turn their heads and see this, oh, and there's that. They wouldn't know where to look. So, it's very difficult to be a gentleman of integrity in this day and age. *The Governing Principles of Ancient China* tells us, "Careless display of valuables invites theft, and seductive attire invites lust." “Careless display” means you flaunt your wealth, or show off, and people will get the urge to steal. Dressing too seductively stirs up lust, and this is not good for social morals. Therefore, being diligent, thrifty and simple brings a good example to the family and society. My mother was proper and did not wear heavy makeup; she always wore light makeup. So, my two older sisters also don’t wear heavy makeup. Instead, the more simple and genuine a person is, the less prone they are to aging.  Those who wear very heavy makeup, please don't visit their homes, because after they remove their makeup, they are like a different person. At my age, when I walk with my older sister, people look and say, “Oh, your younger sister.”  My sister can even carry a travel bag on her back and look like a university student, and she is already over forty years old.

Alright, let’s start from thrift to establish a person's attitude towards self-cultivation, as well as managing the household and a good social atmosphere. And what great benefits can diligence produce? Firstly, good health. Those who actively labor are healthier. I myself feel this very strongly. My father was the eldest son and helped with farming from a young age. He often had to fertilize the fields and carry manure. My father had a very strong physique. You would definitely find it hard to imagine, my physique and my father's are not very similar. My father was strong because he was diligent, because he worked and shouldered responsibilities for his parents. Why am I slim? Because I moved to Kaohsiung City when I was three, and have never even stepped in a field, let alone held a hoe. I was pampered, so my physique isn’t as strong.

Therefore, children these days are problematic, some haven’t even seen a field. We once took a group of children from Shenzhen to the countryside, and they were standing next to the paddy fields, and the children were talking to each other, “Oh my, will we die if we go down there?” The other classmate said, “Don’t worry, there’s cement underneath, you won’t die.” Then that day, they planted rice seedlings for the entire morning, and they were almost completely exhausted when they went back. That day, they ate their food particularly heartily. After the meal, the teacher used the opportunity to teach: “You planted rice seedlings for an entire morning, and that’s how much effort it takes to have one bowl of rice.” They thought about it, and realized that it took them an entire morning of hard work to get only one bowl of rice. Do you think they would waste food after that? Will they have respect for farmers in the future? Yes. This is called experiential education. If children have no experiences, they write essays, and I’ve really seen things like, “I went back to my grandma’s house, and my grandpa picked a watermelon for me from a tree.” Watermelons don’t grow on trees!

Therefore, being diligent results in good health.  Furthermore, a sense of responsibility.  “Rise at dawn to sweep the courtyard; maintain cleanliness inside and out; retire at dusk to lock up and personally check all doors and windows.” Children who diligently help are bound to have a sense of responsibility. Following that, learn to be grateful through labor. In fact, there are many principles; once we really understand them, no one would be unwilling to do it. It's just that the principle is not understood and the resolve cannot be made. When a person knows to be grateful, they will naturally put themselves in other people's shoes. When they go to their workplace, they will be very respectful and thankful to colleagues in other departments. They will not look down on other departments just because their own department is important. Because they know how much everyone in a group is contributing, how much everyone in a family is contributing, they will put themselves in other people's shoes and appreciate others.

Moreover, their interpersonal relationships will definitely be good. Wherever they go, they will be proactive in contributing. Who wouldn’t be happy to live and work with someone like this?  The effects spread from their own physical and mental state to their group life. Furthermore, their abilities are sure to increase significantly. Those who proactively contribute and are willing to suffer losses will naturally receive a great reward and great blessings, and their abilities will also improve. Parents who understand education will tell their children on their first job that they must not fear hardship, they must be proactive in contributing and helping. This carefulness from the beginning is very important.

Ms. Liu Fang, the president of Qingdao, on the day of her wedding, her father told her three sentences. The first, “It’s time to work.” Because at home she was very loved and pampered, but now she was going out to become someone's wife. Therefore, there was an important ritual in ancient weddings; the woman sitting in the sedan chair would throw a small fan out the window. Ladies, have you ever thrown a fan? No? Go back and make up for it. Because this action represents something very important. It represents that one used to be a treasured daughter, but now she is married and becoming a wife, daughter-in-law, and a mother. The fan represents that one's life at home as a pampered daughter, waiving a fan, is now thrown away. It is also even more important to abandon her pampered daughter's temper, and cannot bring it with her, because it will not end well. So, this throwing out represents this meaning.

Therefore, Ms. Liu's father was not simple. Everyone must understand, in any relationship, the most important guidance is most effective at the very beginning. We call that, "be careful at the start.” It’s not easy if you wait until issues have arisen to give them advice. They may have already had many disputes and you start giving guidance, that will be too late. Because they are already only looking at each other’s faults. Therefore, there are too many key life turning points, and people who understand education will grasp them very well.  First, prenatal education.  If you start teaching as soon as you know you’re pregnant, being careful at the start, the child will be very well-behaved; we’ve already seen many such cases.  Next, the first day the child goes to school, no matter if it is kindergarten, elementary school, or even college, when they are going to school, parents must give guidance and teach them.  Also, the first day they go to work, or the day they are married.  Our ancestors understood education so well that weddings were very grand. During the entire wedding process, the newlyweds developed a sense of responsibility and moral principles, which will influence them for their whole lives.  Therefore, the ancients possessed a great wisdom of education.

To give an example, after a couple enters their home, they drink a cross-cupped wine. Have you ever drank that before? If not, go back and make up for it. The cups for the cross-cupped wine are made of gourds, which are bitter, and it is one gourd cut into two halves, then filled with sweet wine. This represents that by drinking this cup, from then on, they share both joy and hardship. Moreover, it is the same gourd cut into two halves, which fit together perfectly as a whole, so they will not be separate from each other. You see, how much that single cup of wine helps to educate and remind people and how much it aids in the strengthening of their minds.

Ms. Liu Fang's father instructed her, first, to work. Second, “Do not cause trouble for others.” That is very kind-hearted. You must know how to endure when you go there, don’t get angry all the time, or cause trouble in other people’s homes. Third, “Do not lose face.” "Damage to virtue brings shame to parents." You see, though these are only three sentences, in many circumstances, the moment these three pieces of advice come to mind, the thought will change.  In reality, emotions and tempers are false, they are not real. Do you think a person's temper is real?  Have you ever lost your temper?  Yes.  Come, bring that temper for me to see. You cannot, because it's fake. Things that change in an instant cannot be real. Do not mistake the fake for the real. What is real? Our inherent goodness and bright virtue, which are always there. As long as we put down these bad habits, the truth will be revealed. Our boundless wisdom and virtue can then be utilized in this life to benefit others.

Everyone has just heard Ms. Liu’s father’s instructions to her. Actually, if we expand on these three sentences, can they be told to a son who is going to start working? “It’s time to work. Go work proactively, don’t be afraid of taking losses.  Second, don’t create trouble for others, be sensible, focus on the bigger picture.  Don’t bring shame to your father.” Let him have a sense of shame.

The benefits of diligence do not end there. Everyone can extrapolate and I won’t give further examples. What about laziness?  It's the complete opposite. It is extremely serious, therefore, our ancestors said, “A hundred vices all arise from laziness.”  Once a person becomes lazy, all bad habits emerge.  This is the reason why diligence and thrift are placed so highly in educational virtues. But parents these days do not understand. I’ve even heard that there are high school students who have their parents wake them up in the morning. They pull them out of bed, bring water for them to brush their teeth and wash their face, bring breakfast to them in bed, and help them get dressed, then they go out. The child only has to do one thing, study well and pass exams. Parents take care of everything else. When I went to college, I still met classmates who had never washed their own clothes. They poured a third of the washing powder into the machine, shook the clothes, and left. The next day, everything was covered in foam. To have never washed your own clothes in college is really too much.

With laziness, their body will not be healthy. With laziness, they will not be responsible.  Therefore, even if these children graduate from college, if they don’t find a job, you will have to find one for them. You will worry for your whole life. Even if you tell them to marry, who will raise their child after they’re married? “Mom, it’s yours.” This is the case for over half of the people these days, not just a few. With laziness, they will not know how to be grateful, they take all others’ contributions for granted, and will not put themselves in others’ shoes, they will only pick fault. Have you all noticed that young people these days are very good at finding faults? They criticize and criticize, then if you ask them, do they have any good ideas? No. They are very good at finding faults, but are not good at thinking constructively. Their interpersonal relationships are bad, their abilities are also poor, they lack magnanimity, have no blessings, and are also lazy. They are served by others and their blessings are worn away. All right, that’s diligence.

Next, thrift. When we see the character for thrift, we think of "Thrift promotes integrity."  A person who is thrifty has a very simple material life, and will not be greedy for money. They are incorruptible. Moreover, "Thrift is close to benevolence."  Why is it close to benevolence? Because thrifty people save money, and then go and help people who are in need, so their compassion will grow continuously. Also, thrift can build future blessings.  It’s called measuring income to determine spending and knowing to save. They can handle emergencies, and create future blessings. Have you all noticed how in this entire materialistic society they emphasize consumption, they don't understand thrift, and they don't know how to save, so when a change comes, a so-called financial crisis, it's like a crushing defeat. Many companies who have savings, like Kazuo Inamori's company (Japanese business magnate), they were not affected even during a financial crisis. He is considered one of the four management gurus in Japan. Three of them have passed away, and he is the only one remaining at over 80 years old. He said, their company encountered a financial crisis, but they had no issues for many decades, they still operated normally, because they followed the traditional approach of saving and not overspending, instead of always consuming and investing. In the end when issues arise, companies collapse.

Thrift is connected to benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Thriftily helping people is benevolence. Thrifty people are not greedy, that is righteousness. You do not take what is not yours, which is righteousness. Propriety: making thrift part of the family rules. Also not wasting food or objects is respecting all things, “Do not be disrespectful," that is propriety. Therefore, a person who is wasteful is also being disrespectful. They are being very disrespectful towards the Earth's resources. There is a saying that if all Chinese people had the same lifestyle as Americans, then three or four Earths would not be enough. Therefore, Chinese people must return to diligence and thrift, to allow Mother Earth to recover, and must not continue down the path of the American lifestyle. But, before I understood, I watched many Hollywood movies and was misguided in that direction. Having thrift and passing it on to future generations is a wise thing to do. Of course, you must follow the path of the middle way, and not become stingy, because then you would not be benevolent. If after being thrifty you become greedier, then you are not righteous. If you become so thrifty that you won't buy anything delicious for your parents, that is not respectful to them. If you save up a lot of money for your descendants, that is not wise. Therefore, the ancients emphasized this middle path, which is very subtle.

All of these things can be understood through teaching; otherwise the current social atmosphere is confusing and can lead people astray.  Alright, let's reclaim the wisdom of education from the East, from China. Only through education can the various problems be fundamentally solved. Therefore, in the *Record of Rituals - Record of Learning*, it says, "To establish a country and govern its people, education is paramount." We spoke about the third key point yesterday, which was the suffering of humanity. We have found the reason: incorrect thinking and being blinded by self-interest.  Changing their thinking relies on education. Therefore, our fourth key point today is, “To establish a country and govern its people, education is paramount.”

In the *Record of Rituals - Record of Learning*, it says that if a person handles matters very carefully and meticulously, and often reads the works of the sages, he may have some fame, but he will not be able to move the masses.  If he is able to show respect to the virtuous, and often befriend people with morality and be compassionate to people far away, “embracing the virtuous and cherishing those distant.” This will move people, and show he has a loving heart, "enough to move the masses," but "not enough to transform the people.” He is not able to change the whole social atmosphere of the region. Therefore, “If a gentleman wishes to transform the people and create a better social atmosphere, it must be through learning!”  To improve the overall social customs, one must begin with teaching.

And when we see this sentence, the gentleman “transforms the people and creates a better social atmosphere,” this sentence applies from the family to the entire nation and world.  If a gentleman wants to transform the people and create better customs, from the family perspective, who is the gentleman? The parents. Who are the people? The children. Customs are the formation of the family atmosphere. Expanding this to the class level, who is the gentleman? The class teacher. The people are the students.  A better social atmosphere is the formation of the class culture. And, once a certain atmosphere is created, it will have a subtle influence. Everyone has been in our “Ju Mei Xin” (a family name) family for a few days; do you feel that your way of eating is slightly different? That your way of walking is slightly different? This is the influence of an environment.  These meals you've eaten in your life are all preceded with a word of gratitude, do they taste different? They do. When you say a word of gratitude, the food crystals will be particularly beautiful and it will be particularly nourishing. This can be tested experimentally.

Furthermore, the principal is the gentleman, who are the people? The teachers and students, the principal is the head of the household.  A better social atmosphere is the creation of the school culture. Like the example we gave a few days ago, the entire Songhua River High School shows great respect to Confucius and respect to the teachers, and the students’ actions are very natural. This can be attributed to teacher Wang Qi. When he was a class teacher, he gradually promoted this class culture, which influenced the entire school culture. This is the school. If we expand this to social organizations and businesses, then the business owner is the gentleman, the people are their employees and subordinates, and a better social atmosphere is the emergence of the entire company culture. Moreover, the customs form what we call “environmental education,” the environment influences them every day with a subtle impact. Along with the gentleman’s example, setting an example through their actions. Therefore, gentlemen are all setting examples through their actions. Because the character for education “教” contains this very spirit.

Let’s look at the character “教” (jiào), meaning "to teach." On the left are two Xs, and below it, a child.  Our ancestors incorporated the truth of the universe and the heavens into the character. Therefore, Chinese characters contain great wisdom, which is unique in the world; the characters must be passed on. The first X is made by the parents, elders and teachers. Children have very strong powers of imitation, and follow along, doing what is done above, setting an example.  On the right, there is a hand holding a branch, admonishing the person face-to-face with unwearying patience.

In fact, as educators, if we do not reflect on ourselves when facing the issues of children, we are definitely acting impulsively. How do we reflect? It’s not complicated. We can reflect using these two points. When we criticize children, have I set an example through my own actions?  Did I teach them first? As long as we reflect on these things, we will know how to improve ourselves and change the situation, and we can definitely improve, as long as we adjust ourselves. This is setting an example through our actions. Furthermore, even if we really set an example through our own actions, we must also be patient. Speaking once or twice and if they don't listen, this is because each child has a different temperament. Has anyone encountered a child who changed immediately after being told something? If you have, you must notify me, they may be a reincarnation of Yan Hui (a disciple of Confucius known for his virtue), who never made the same mistake twice. So, in general, it is impossible to not have patience. You must always remind them. But if you are not patient, you will get angry immediately. When you lose your temper, the child will not remember what you told them, they will only remember that the teacher is very strict and short-tempered. Then, it will be ineffective.  If you have really set an example through your actions, and you are also very patient, then you can let go of some attachments, "How can things be exactly as we wish, we can only strive to be without shame in our hearts". Children have their own blessings and so do students. Ask yourself if you have tried your best, and that is all.

Verbal instruction, example through actions, environmental education. Verbal instruction means grasping educational opportunities to teach the children. Everyone must understand that children these days mature earlier, and like to overthink things, so if you keep telling them all the time, they will feel annoyed. But if they discover something, and you take that opportunity to explain it to them, they will be deeply impressed. For example, if there is a conflict, tell them immediately where the root of the conflict is. They will think, and then realize that the root cause was they were angry first, that they lost their temper, and that the other person was not in the wrong. They will be very impressed. “When people fight, how do you know you are not at fault? You must calmly reflect.”  Moreover, our ancestors also left us with an idiom, “It takes two to tango.” When people fight, there must be an issue on both sides. Parents of the past understood this principle. If their child had a conflict with someone, they would not even ask, they would punish them first. You were already angry when you fought, which is already wrong, so what else can you say?  If you are truly cultivated, you would not have a conflict with others. Alright, this is the business setting.

Furthermore, the leader of a country is the gentleman. The people are the entire nation's people. What is formed is the national culture. We see in *The Book of Songs* there are fifteen “Guo Feng” (folk songs) and those folk songs are records of the social culture of the time.  Therefore, this sentence, “If a gentleman wishes to transform the people and create a better social atmosphere,” this principle expands from the small unit of the family to the whole world, and the principle is all connected.  Family, class, school, to business and organizations, to a country, and ultimately, in the world, who should be the gentleman?  A sage king.  We see that in the Spring and Autumn Period, King Wen of Zhou’s territory was actually very small, but many hundreds of lords were all loyal to him because of his virtue. King Tang only had seventy *li* (Chinese unit of distance, about 0.5 km) of land, but in the end, the whole world followed him and he became king of the world. King Wen only had a hundred *li*, but he became king of the world. Therefore, a sage king will influence the world. The people are the people of the world, and the customs are the trends of the society, and they will be led by him. Therefore, we can foresee that in the near future, what Chairman Xi is doing will become an example for the world to follow, and China will then lead the world.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Title: The Importance of Reviving Ancient Wisdom**

So, the ancient classics all emphasize “the world” and “all under heaven”, and there's good reason for that! Why? Because what has the world become? A global village. If we don’t offer good influences to others, we will be negatively influenced by them. Therefore, we must urgently revive the teachings of the ancient sages.

Therefore, “teaching comes first.” And what is learning? It is awareness, it is the meaning of enlightenment. We must first understand principles and be enlightened before we can teach others. So, teaching – in “education” – we’ve already grasped the meaning of the word “teach.” And the word “educate” (育, *yu*) – “to raise a child, start by doing good.” This is the definition of *yu* according to the *Shuowen Jiezi* (a classic Chinese dictionary). (Here, I must apologize to the principals and colleagues in education ahead of time, because before coming on stage, our senior classmate Guo reminded me to write the characters larger. You see, I haven't broken my habit. It was only when writing this sentence that I remembered. So, I'm very sorry. Realizing that it's not easy to change even one of my own habits, I become more tolerant of others and don’t demand too much from them. So, although I'm a teacher, I’m not yet qualified as a disciple of the sages. I must constantly educate and remind myself.) And in this phrase, “to raise a child, start by doing good,” where is the key word? It’s not “raise,” but what? “Good.” It is about helping them become principled and kind people. Therefore, the most important aspects of our ancient ancestors’ education were ethics, morality, and the law of cause and effect. In ethical and moral education, we have the five cardinal relationships in ethics and the eight virtues in morality. After learning these, people have a sense of shame, shame at doing evil, and they are unwilling to violate these moral standards. By learning the education of cause and effect—that evil actions bring evil consequences and good actions bring good rewards—they won’t dare to do evil.

Among ethical and moral principles, filial piety is the most important. Therefore, the ancients said that filial piety should be practiced promptly. And a person who is not filial would, in ancient times, be said to be struck by lightning. In Longyou, there was once a family named Xu, with two brothers, whose mother they cared for in turns. The elder brother was poorer. Originally, he was to provide for her for five days. Once, on the second or third day, he ran out of food. Having no other choice, he asked his mother to go to his younger brother’s first, with the plan to make up for the time later. When she arrived at the younger brother’s house, he looked at his mother and refused to open the door. “Your time is not up. You cannot come in.”

Sometimes I hear that parents are being cared for nowadays, staying a while here, then a while there, then somewhere else. If the parents are happy, then that’s fine. But, I feel that if it were me, I wouldn’t like it. Constantly moving from one place to another, the pillow even needs a day or two to get used to, sleep would be restless, right? And frequently traveling, even my old bones would be a bit much. In my father’s time, a person who was the eldest son wouldn’t have agreed to this. “I’m the eldest son, I have the responsibility.” Therefore, my grandparents lived with us for decades, and we grew up with their care. The eldest son always had this sense of responsibility. Of course, if the parents are happy, that’s fine, but if this type of arrangement makes their life difficult, it's better for them to live with the eldest son. Siblings can visit.

Returning to the story, when the mother wanted to come in, he wouldn’t let her. The mother was very sad, but she was so hungry. She could also smell the aroma of cooked rice. "At least let me finish this meal before I go," she pleaded. Her younger brother still wouldn't open the door. Her mother was very heartbroken. As she was talking, the son told his wife, "Quickly, take the rice into the room and cover it with a blanket." Sometimes when we hear this story, we think, how could they be so cruel? The mother was very sad and left. Soon after she left, suddenly there was a great clap of thunder, which struck the younger son's house and killed the couple. When the neighbors saw that the house was on fire, they quickly rushed to help. They found the couple dead, one in the room, and one in the hall. And when they lifted the blanket, the rice was still steaming.

As a result, one of our teachers, Mr. Wang, told this story to his students. One student began to tremble and when he was asked, "What's wrong?", he replied, “I had a classmate who died at fifteen. He was very unfilial, always disobeying his parents. Once when it was raining, he was about 150 meters away from me, and I personally saw him struck and killed by lightning.” He was very shaken, because he witnessed firsthand his classmate, for being unfilial, being struck by lightning. So, this story teaches ethics and morality and also tells us what? Cause and effect: we cannot be unfilial.

Therefore, there are two things in life that cannot wait: practicing filial piety, and the other is, doing good cannot wait. If a person and their family encounter a catastrophe, how much money can solve it? No amount of money can solve it. We have all seen people with assets of tens or hundreds of millions, whose wives contracted cancer. They could build a cancer hospital, but they still couldn’t save their wives. So, in life, there are two kinds of accounts. One is your bank account holding RMB, and the other is your account for accumulating virtues. If this account for accumulating virtues is full enough, then even in the face of great disaster, you can turn ill fortune into good fortune. We have seen this before. During the “9/11” event in 2001, one of my principal’s classmates was a very cultivated man who had never been late for work in decades. It just happened that he overslept on the day of “9/11.” How could that be so coincidental? Never in decades had such a thing happened, and it just happened that day. It turned out that he worked in one of the towers. By the time he walked out of the subway, he saw the two towers collapse. During the usual time, he would have already been inside. Therefore, the ancients said that doing good cannot wait. It's very true.

During the Ming dynasty, there was a businessman named Wang Zhiren. He was in his thirties and had no children, which was considered to be a lack of good fortune. Then, the area between his eyebrows began to darken. A face reader who was very skilled told him that he wouldn't make it past this ordeal, and he should prepare for his affairs. Because he was a businessman from Anhui, he went to Suzhou to quickly collect all the outstanding payments to leave for his family. During the process of collecting these payments, he arrived at a place and happened to see a woman attempting to commit suicide by jumping into the water with her child. He immediately yelled, “Which boatman will save them? I will give ten taels of silver!” The boatman quickly saved them. He then asked the woman, “Why would you try to take your own life?” She said, “We raised a pig. After much effort, we finally got it to grow big. My husband is not home. Someone came to buy it. I sold it and received some money, only to discover that it was counterfeit. My husband has a bad temper. He’ll beat me to death when he gets back. I really didn’t want to live, so I jumped into the water, taking my child with me.” He saved two lives in one rescue.

The woman's husband returned that day, and she told him what had happened. Her husband said, "There is no such person in the world! How could anyone be so kind?" He didn't believe her, so he told his wife to go look for this man. Later, they found him at the inn. It was evening when the wife knocked on the door. "Sir," she called. Wang Zhiren, still being very cultured, said, "Madam, it is evening. We are alone, man and woman. I cannot open the door for you, or people will gossip and your reputation will be ruined. I cannot open the door. Please go home." Her husband, who was listening nearby, was moved. "Don't worry. I came with my wife. Please open the door." When the door opened, suddenly, because it was raining and the inn was old, the whole wall collapsed, crushing his bed. If this couple hadn't knocked on the door, he would have died at that very moment. However, because he had saved two lives and was so virtuous and cultured, his fate was changed. Later, when he returned home, the face reader said that the area between his eyebrows was glowing. He had accumulated much Yin virtue. Later, he had ten sons. He was originally fated to die at thirty-something, but he lived to be ninety-six. So, doing good cannot wait. If we can instill these stories and principles in children from a young age, I think it will be very beneficial for their entire lives.

Alright, let's talk about ethics and morality, which are very important: the five cardinal relationships and the eight virtues. In the *Book of Rites*, it says, "There is a husband and wife, and therefore there is a father and son, and therefore there are brothers." Further extending from these three ethical relations in the family, there is the entire society: there are ruler and subjects, and there are friends. As long as people understand these five cardinal relationships, they can live in harmony. Heaven’s timing is not as important as the advantages of terrain, and the advantages of terrain are not as important as harmonious human relationships. If one manages human relationships well, one’s life will be harmonious and happy. When we Chinese speak of ethics, it's not just about these three relationships within the family; it extends to the entire society. At school, teachers are called "masters," and fellow students are called "fellow apprentices." In various professions, for example, if one is learning to cut hair, the person teaching is also called a "master," and those learning together are also called "fellow apprentices." These are all ethical relationships based on mutual respect. The father-son relationship extends to groups in society; the ruler is also respected as a father. A loyal subject comes from the door of a filial son, a conversion from filial piety to loyalty. Therefore, a person who is not filial to their parents cannot be a loyal subject. A person who does not love his siblings cannot be a true and trustworthy friend; that kind of friendship will only be for personal gain.

From these five cardinal relationships, what is the core? It’s the relationship between husband and wife. “When the husband and wife have righteousness, then the father and son have affection,” and only then can brothers be loving and respectful. If a husband and wife are constantly arguing, can a father and son be close? Can brothers be loving? Everyone will want to escape from that house as soon as possible. Therefore, for the next generation to have a healthy character, the most crucial factor is the harmony between husband and wife. This is the core of the five cardinal relationships. This is why our ancestors placed so much emphasis on marriage and wedding ceremonies. The family is the cell of society. If the family is not well, then society will certainly be in chaos. So, “If children are not taught, their hearts become corrupt.” If the husband and wife haven’t set a good example, how can the children be taught well? “If the family is not well-ordered, society will be chaotic.” So, embarking on marriage is to take responsibility for the family and society.

Now, I would like to ask everyone, our children are still young, and who should be taught about this important way of human relationships between husband and wife? Ourselves, and? The parents of our students. When we have the opportunity to communicate with parents, we can cite some examples. In fact, many of our students, on many nights, because their father was hitting their mother or their parents were arguing, they hide under the blankets crying. How can their characters be healthy? They don’t know how long they have cried until they are so exhausted they finally fall asleep. And then, when they wake up in the morning, they are still cautiously observing their parents’ expressions, to see if the storm has passed. This affects their body and mind, their character and their learning.

From childhood until now, I have never had any of these pressures, because my parents never argued. My mother never said an angry or hurtful word. At most, my mother would remain silent. So, when I was being loud and mischievous, my mother would just ignore me. She wouldn't scold me. So, I used to act spoiled and cry for things, rolling around on the floor, and she would remain completely unmoved, continuing to read her book. Eventually, I became "enlightened." It was tiring to roll around, and the floor was cold. Then I realized it was useless, and I wasn't crazy for enjoying rolling around. Afterward, I didn't do it anymore. I began to interact with my parents according to their principles.

So, according to whose standard do children determine right from wrong? When we were young, when visiting someone’s home, the elders would offer things and say, "Come, have some." We’d say, "Yes, thank you" before daring to eat. "Come, please have some," and you’d look over and they say, "Mmhmm." Yes, parents are the standard. So, in truth, you must be a good person all the way. To truly teach children well, parent-teacher collaboration is necessary. Therefore, communicating educational philosophies with parents is even more important than teaching children! And when communicating with parents, we aren’t saying we want to criticize them, because people haven’t learned these things before. You can explain how a husband and wife should interact with each other. Alright, a discussion on the relationship between husband and wife would take a long time, and we can discuss it further in a special report. I just want to let everyone know the importance of the five cardinal relationships. Tomorrow, we will start discussing the eight virtues, which are the core of teaching, the five cardinal relationships and the eight virtues. Tomorrow, we will also discuss our common vocation, "reviving the way of the teacher." The two most important forces of the Chinese nation are filial piety and the way of the teacher. Now that the way of the teacher has declined, we have a responsibility to revive it. Where should we start to revive the way of the teacher? From self-education and self-improvement. People earn the respect of others through the actions they take; respect is not something that can be demanded. We will also discuss another topic: how do we become good teachers? Who is the best role model? Confucius. How Confucius was as a student, and how Confucius was as a teacher.

We will share these things with everyone tomorrow. Alright, thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text, striving for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow in English:

**Lecture 6: Establishing a Nation and Governing the People: Education First**

Respected Director Wang, esteemed leaders, honored principals, and fellow educators, good morning!

Thinking back nine years, to 2004, also in July, on the 13th of July—coincidentally, it's the same date today! It's our nine-year anniversary. At that time, we held our first “Happy Life” lecture series in Haikou, a five-day event from July 13th to 17th. During that time, the Director of the Haikou Education Bureau personally participated in the courses. At the end of the series, I personally saw the Director off. As his car slowly pulled away, I was truly overwhelmed and moved. To see a bureau director so personally concerned about traditional education moved me to tears. I actually crouched down and wept. Men crying aren’t something people are used to seeing, so I crouched down. My colleagues, thinking something had happened, became quite anxious. I told them, "It's nothing; I'm just too touched." In our “Moral Education” textbooks, we often read about officials who love their people like their own children. Sometimes, reading such stories would bring tears to our eyes, but with a sense of joy. This spiritual connection with the ancients felt particularly profound, and we took them as our role models. And seeing the Haikou Education Bureau Director attending in person, I felt that these officials truly carried the virtue of the sages, filling me with admiration.

This time, I’m honored to meet Director Wang Baozhai. He is truly a role model for our education community, tireless in his efforts to promote the teachings of the sages. Especially just now, after the meal, seeing the three cadres from Wangdu walk over to their leader, the warm affection they showed was palpable. You could feel their unity of purpose. As the saying goes, "When two people are of one heart, their strength can break metal." *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: “When a country is about to prosper, there are bound to be auspicious signs.” Our nation's revitalization must begin with our intellectuals and the educational community taking on this historical mission. And the historical mission of our education community is starting here in Wangdu, led by Director Wang, with the full support and cooperation of so many cadres. We are certain to set an excellent example in the education field. The power of a role model is immense. Furthermore, there is a crucial operating principle: we must concentrate our human, material, and financial resources to successfully carry out a mature endeavor. If these resources are scattered, there might seem to be opportunities everywhere, but ultimately, nothing will be accomplished. We are very fortunate this time to learn about the practical experiences Director Wang and others have been implementing in Wangdu. And you, principals and fellow educators, many of you possess great compassion for education, along with experience, wisdom, and ability. I believe this group is filled with hidden talent. Therefore, I humbly ask the experienced principals and teachers to set aside our differences and come to Wangdu to contribute our part.

I'd like to discuss the fourth key point: "Establishing a nation and governing the people, education comes first." To cultivate a strong family culture, class culture, school culture, and even our national culture, for Chinese people to lead the world, we must begin with education. The word "teach" (*jiao*) implies “what superiors enact, inferiors will emulate.” Whether they are parents, teachers, or elders, they must first have a correct philosophy and understanding of education so that they can guide others correctly.

Let’s calmly consider what the goals of education have been for thousands of years, on what foundation it is built, what its central content is, and what spirit it aims to uphold. First, the goal of education. Educators seek to "cultivate the best talents under heaven" meaning they are cultivating talents for the nation and for families. But let’s observe a phenomenon that warrants our reflection: every year there are so many college graduates, yet businesses say they cannot find talented individuals. Schools continue to send graduates out into society, yet these business organizations don't feel they have found qualified personnel. This indicates that the students we are producing don’t seem to quite match the talent that society needs. What kind of talent does society need? Of course, it needs individuals who are both capable and ethical. Has anyone here encountered a business that says, “The talent I need are people with high degrees” or “The talent I need are people who are great at taking tests?” If any of you have, please raise your hands. So, we must strive to prepare our children for their future careers and their lives. We must teach them the most important virtues, attitudes, and ethics—which will affect their entire future—and that is to give them lifelong happiness. As the ancients said, and it hasn't changed in thousands of years, “To find people for the world.” That is the mission of educators. If you "find people for the world," if you cultivate someone like Fan Zhongyan, you will benefit countless people. Therefore, the goal of education is "to find people for the world"—to find talent and cultivate people.

From the students' perspective, education is about "enhancing their goodness and correcting their shortcomings." This crucial passage from *The Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites* encapsulates the core of education. Are students continuously growing more respectful? Is their filial piety growing? Are their hearts of generosity and helpfulness increasing? "Correcting their shortcomings" implies: are their bad habits being improved? Is their laziness being corrected? Is their arrogance being diminished? Is their greed being controlled? These two key focal points are "enhancing goodness" and "correcting shortcomings." This is what’s important for educators. Because if teachers and parents fail to grasp this core of education, they could easily waste their entire lives, waste over a decade of time, and not cultivate a single talent.

Fellow educators, let’s calmly observe another phenomenon. A child who ranks first or second in grades might, upon seeing us in the street, go out of their way to avoid us. On the contrary, those we scolded the most, even those we hit—because we meant well— might, from a distance of one hundred and fifty meters, wave their hands and say, "Hello, teacher!" Have you experienced this? Which child’s heart is more compassionate? I’ll tell you that those who are successful in today's society are rarely those who ranked first or second in school. Those who are average, middling in their studies, but who respect their teachers, are friendly with classmates, and have good interpersonal skills, are the ones who often achieve great things later in life. Those who rank first or second, what are they most likely to become? They become professional technicians. It is rare that they become leaders. It does happen, but not often. These phenomena should prompt us to calmly consider whether we, as teachers and parents, are always aware of the state of our children’s hearts. Is their goodness declining or increasing?

I often ask the general public: are people more virtuous as children or as adults? We spend over a decade cultivating people, yet their virtue declines. Isn’t that something we should reflect on? Let me ask a more pointed question: are students more virtuous as freshmen or as seniors in college? Universities are sacred halls, how can they have become places where people are falling morally? When we don’t understand the meaning of “enhancing goodness and correcting shortcomings”, we might be thinking we are benefiting our children, but we might actually be destroying their innate understanding.

Calmly consider this: young elementary school students’ eyes are bright and full of life. Tell them a story, and they are moved to tears. Yet in college, tell the same kind of moving story, and they won't be receptive. We’ve observed this. Some mischievous children are actually very emotional. If you tell them a story about filial piety, they will cry and then, after class, they will come over and say, "Teacher, these stories are so moving, so wonderful, please tell us more." But those who ranked first and second in class, halfway through the story they will say, "Teacher, this won't be on the exam, don’t bother.” Their capacity for empathy is steadily declining. Why? The key point to understand is that people become numb because their life's driving force becomes “gain” and “desire”. They slowly become numb. They need to be continually stimulated by greed and desire, and the intensity of this stimulation must keep increasing.

When is reading enjoyable? When it brings joy. Today, it’s like we’re constantly pressuring children. After the exam, they seem like they absolutely must release their stress. They go dancing or partying. This is not healthy for a child’s development. Also, if you calmly observe, what happens after the final exam of the college entrance exam? Books are thrown out the windows from the third and fourth floors. Those sensitive to educational matters don’t see books falling to the ground; they see what? They see that the children have lost their motivation to learn. In fact, college years, and the years when they step into society, are their prime years for learning. If they don't learn well during these years, where will they gain the wisdom and knowledge needed to navigate their lives? During this crucial period of learning, they’ve already lost the motivation to learn. In the future, parents and teachers will have endless worries.

Therefore, the idea of “enhancing goodness and correcting shortcomings” gives us a lot to reflect upon. When do we enhance goodness? When do we correct shortcomings? For example, after an exam, when handing back the test papers, that is the most crucial moment for enhancing goodness and correcting shortcomings. If the teachers don't understand this idea at this time, then within the atmosphere of the exam, the students' hearts may become sick. Tell me, do the students with good grades get sicker than those with bad grades? It's hard to say. Every year before summer vacation, many college students jump off buildings and commit suicide. This is not decreasing because we haven’t found the root cause. The root cause is that their hearts have been out of balance for a long time, and nobody noticed.

The last time I was in Singapore, in the second half of last year, as soon as I got into a car, a lady said to me that her neighbor, a young person of nineteen years, had committed suicide. The parents said their child “suddenly committed suicide.” I told the lady that this didn’t make logical sense. How can a teenager think life is wonderful one day, and suddenly decide not to live the next? Yet, did you notice the phrase the parents used? "Suddenly committed suicide.”

In today’s world, how many people clearly understand the problem? Have we calmly reflected on it? Moreover, the first reaction when a problem arises is to blame others, to shift the responsibility onto others or the environment, because we lack the traditional cultural attitude of “seeking the cause within ourselves.” What is even more shocking is that parents and children are supposed to be connected, yet now the children are walking down a dead-end path, and the parents have no idea and say it was “sudden suicide.”

In 2011, there was a most beautiful young woman, Meng Peijie, who was studying at a teacher training college in Linfen, Shanxi Province. Her adoptive mother became paralyzed when she was eight years old. This eight-year-old girl, whose mother was twice her weight, had to help her mother with every move and exercise, day after day, for over a decade. It's hard to imagine how she lived her life. Her adoptive mother didn’t want to be a burden to her and had accumulated painkillers planning to swallow them all and commit suicide. She immediately sensed what her mother was planning, knelt down and cried, "Mother, as long as you live, you are my source of strength. A child with a mother has a home." Her mother was moved. Later, she became so filial. She even took her mother with her when she went to college and rented a place nearby. Her filial piety moved the local hospital to treat her mother, and now her mother can use a wheelchair.

So, parents and children are supposed to be connected, so why is it that in society, parents and children seem to have completely lost touch with each other? What do parents care about now? How many points did their child get on the test? Where did their piano practice get them? Do their achievements give the parents a good image? When all we care about are these things such as fame and gain, naturally, our hearts will become numb. Today, many children’s problems come after an exam, their hearts become skewed, but no one notices. Actually, how do I know? Because I went through this as well. So as elders and as people in education, we must ensure that our children don’t walk the same detours and unnecessary paths we did.

Fellow educators, are your lives happy? A woman in her twenties or thirties often, every time her mother came back from a wedding banquet, would tell her, “Get married soon! Every time I go to a wedding banquet, everyone asks, ‘Why isn’t your daughter married yet?’” She would ask everywhere, "I don’t know where to put my face, you get married soon!" Her daughter would tell her, "Mom, you are not happy, why do you want me to marry?" Her mother paused and thought for a moment, "Oh, yeah, I’m always arguing with my husband, why would I want her to get married?" After another minute she said, “Anyway, you have to marry!” Tell me, how long does our rational thought last? Because we are too impetuous and don’t know what we are seeking in life.

Actually, this story makes us think deeply. It’s just like today you are walking on the road and you fell into a pit. Luckily, you have the blessings of your ancestors, and you didn’t break any bones and you were able to climb back out. What would you do next? Right, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” But the hole is too big and can’t be filled in quickly. First you must put up a sign fifty meters ahead that says “Hole in the road ahead”. Then, you gradually fill it in. The hole has been there too long, neglected for two or three generations, so to fill it in requires two or three generations of relentless, continued effort.

But what happens now? We fall in, climb out, then hide in the bushes, thinking, "Why did I have to fall in? That's not fair!" And then someone else falls in and we think, "Ah, great, I am not the only one!" We are gleeful at the misfortune of others. This tendency is very real. For instance, someone breaks up with their partner and is crying. You might say, "Ah, that makes me feel better, I am not the only one that broke up with their partner." Instead, we should always think that we don’t want others to suffer the same pain we have suffered. You are pushing your daughter to marry, yet you don’t know if it's going to be happy or a pitfall. Why are you pushing so hard? We must always use the scales to measure what is more important. Is your daughter’s life-long happiness more important or your pride? Happiness? That is the standard answer. Standard answers only appear on exam papers, not in real life situations.

Tell me, putting the scales back out, is the health of a child's personality and the happiness of their life more important, or their grades right now? The standard answer appears again. But I will tell you that if we have Chinese culture we have a method to achieve both. Children can be healthy in their personality, and their grades can get better and better, and for their whole lives, because this tackles the root of the problem. But we are pressuring them, and what is their achievement? It’s good once, twice, maybe good in elementary school, junior high school, or high school, but there will come a day when they won't be good. Do you believe that? Why? Because they don’t have the fundamental motivation to study hard. Actually, these questions are not hard to ponder; it's just that no one is pointing them out. So, people in education must remind parents, and we must begin with the idea of "enhancing goodness and correcting shortcomings."

In my father's generation, in their studies, work, forming families, married life and educating their children, they never caused my grandparents any worries. I never saw my grandparents frown at my father. This is only one generation ago. Why? Because they understood filial piety since they were young. That is part of our Chinese culture that has still been passed down. There were five siblings in my father’s generation; my father is 71 now. Several of them were university graduates and one has a doctorate degree. Our family was very poor when I was young, and people looked down on us. So, the siblings had a lot of ambition. My uncle, who has a doctorate degree, after school, would go help in the fields, not because he had more time to study than others, but he cherished every moment and didn’t dare to waste it. While planting rice, he reminded himself that he needed to study hard, to achieve something quickly, so that his parents could rest, so they wouldn’t have to work so hard. That is why my grandfather retired around the age of fifty, because his children were so filial. My father and his siblings started their studies later than average. When my grandfather was going to sleep, he would give the command that everyone needed to go to sleep. The moment his father gave the order, all of them would lie down because they were filial. Then when my grandfather had fallen asleep, they would hear that, and all of them would get up and study again.

You see, in the old days the siblings' affection was great. They didn’t have much money and five people shared one popsicle. Was it delicious? It was delicious! Now, if one person has three popsicles it still isn’t delicious, right? They’d say, “I don’t want it. Throw it out.” So, we’ve entered a trap. We think we need to have money to be happy, but the truth is we need love to be happy, and we need family togetherness to be happy, not money. You see when siblings recall sharing one popsicle, they always laugh happily. That deep affection between siblings is so obvious.

So studying does not need people to worry about it. My father ate “beef broth noodles” throughout his university life. He never had beef noodles, because “beef broth noodles” didn’t have any actual beef, just the broth. He didn’t have the heart to spend that extra money on actual beef. My father would receive all the money for the semester at the beginning of the semester, and it was just a little. He would scrimp and save. So even later when they were more well-off, if my father dropped rice on the ground, he would still pick it up. That frugal attitude was cultivated since he was a child.

The fundamental motivation for studying is responsibility, is filial piety. Have our children’s goodness grown in this aspect? Because they have this responsibility, they decide that they won’t cause their parents to worry about their career or family. Where are these things found? In *The Rules for Students*, "What parents love, strive to provide." "A wound to one’s body causes parental grief; a flaw in virtue causes parental shame.” How long do parents need to worry when children are always fighting or arguing with each other? Including "Reside in a regular place, have a stable career.” Nowadays, young people change jobs easily and parents worry immensely.

The day before yesterday, we listened to Teacher Wang Xihai’s sharing. Look how sensitive a filial child’s heart is. A filial child only has parents in their heart. They are always aware of their father’s needs, like a deep connection. When the father is comfortable, the child feels comfortable; when the father is suffering, the child immediately knows. They can even sense it in their dreams. The father had a fever for many days and they could not find the cause. Because the child was thinking about this constantly, this allowed for communication between them. He dreamt that he was climbing a ladder and fell off it. He realized that there must be something wrong with his father’s feet. He immediately went to check and found an inflamed swelling on his father’s foot. So *The Classic of Filial Piety* is not just a set of empty words, “When filial piety reaches its highest point, it will connect with the divine and illuminate the world.” *The Classic of Filial Piety* also says that "Those who love their parents dare not be unkind to others.” Those who truly love their parents will not be arrogant towards other people. Why? Because when the heart of filial piety opens, the heart of compassion will open. Compassion is our inherent moral awareness, and it is blocked by selfishness and self-interest. Now when one thinks only of one’s parents, there is no selfishness and self-interest. When the heart of compassion emerges, you’ll see them view all parents as their own parents. He was moved to tears when speaking of all the elderly; he views the elderly with the heart of a true son or daughter. Even one small movement or expression, and he can immediately understand their meaning. This is the compassionate heart that everyone inherently possesses. In the hospital, he saw an elderly person slightly pull up their leg and no one understood, but he understood. The elderly person was embarrassed because no one had helped him adjust his pants; the elderly also had pride. So, if our children open their hearts to filial piety and all have the mindset of Teacher Wang Xihai, then our country, our people, and every family will have a happy future.

Let’s pull back for a moment and think calmly, what is the motivation for our children to study now? Don't underestimate the power of *The Rules for Students*. The fundamental motivation for studying that *The Rules for Students* teaches is "filial piety”. Then there is “Treat everyone with love.” I want to have better knowledge and ability so that I can better love the people of our China. They will work hard. This is also their motivation. They "befriend the virtuous." They are close to their teachers. They ask themselves, "How can I repay the kindness of my teachers? I must study hard so that I will not disappoint my teachers." That too is their motivation.

Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and natural flow in English, while keeping in mind the context of a book aimed at parents and educators:

**On Cultivating Reading Habits and Learning with Purpose**

The methods for reading are taught, and so is “using remaining energy to study literature.” However, “if one does not practice, and only studies literature, one will grow in empty pride.” This saying can help to subdue the arrogance of our children, who often become more conceited the higher their education level rises. We must teach them the importance of “knowing and acting as one” from a young age. The “methods of reading” involve “three essentials: the mind, the eyes, and the mouth, all must be sincerely engaged.” Learning requires a focused attitude. Nowadays, children cannot sit still for twenty minutes; they are too restless and unfocused, their minds scattered. We must teach them to concentrate. “When reading this, do not admire that,” means we must be focused, not distracted. Furthermore, when learning something, we should put in the effort step by step, not flipping through this today and that tomorrow. “Before this is finished, do not begin the other.”

Next, regarding study methods, “be broad in setting limits, but diligent in practice.” This teaches the importance of planning for reading and for anything else you do. For example, when organizing an event within the class, have the students divide up responsibilities. In fact, within a class, children can learn how to be subordinates and how to obey, and then progress to how to be leaders and how to plan. All of this can be cultivated within a classroom. Therefore, whether a teacher knows how to teach morality and life skills makes a huge difference. Those who know, their students become sensible and capable; those who don’t, years will pass with little impact. This is why teachers must constantly improve themselves. They realize that the sooner they gain wisdom and capability, the sooner their students will benefit. In this way, all educators should constantly strive to improve themselves, hoping to benefit their students as soon as possible, living up to the trust placed in them and the opportunities they are given. Therefore, "be broad in setting limits, but diligent in practice; when the effort is there, obstacles will be overcome." “When the mind has doubts, take notes; ask others, seek a clear meaning.” How many of today's children adopt this attitude? When there is something they do not understand, they should be eager to learn, eager to ask, and immediately consult with others. A student who is eager to learn and eager to ask will surely have a bright future.

Furthermore, the learning environment must be pure and clean. “Rooms should be clean, walls neat, desks tidy, and writing implements in order.” “When ink is ground unevenly, the heart is not upright; when characters are written disrespectfully, the heart is already sick.” When one’s surroundings are chaotic, it is difficult to settle one’s mind. Furthermore, that person will be reduced to an exam-taking machine, not cultivating virtue. A person who truly understands the lessons in their textbooks will surely be respectful toward people, toward events, and toward all things. They would not allow their rooms to be in such a mess. Isn’t the teachings of the sages about teaching us sincerity and respect? If one has a sincere and respectful heart, how could their room be so disorganized? Furthermore, notice that every action is done with steadiness. “When ink is ground unevenly, the heart is not upright; when characters are written disrespectfully...” Writing is also about "cultivating virtue." Today, children's handwriting is messy and often slanted. I am amazed by students who don't hold their pens straight, writing at an angle with their paper also tilted. I admire how their pens can write straight when held at such angles. Therefore, we must practice calligraphy and strive for square, upright characters. “The Way cannot be departed from for even a moment.” Every action is about self-cultivation, including writing. If one writes crookedly, the heart is already sick; if one writes hastily, the heart is already sick.

Later, it says, "Books not of the sages, avoid looking at; they obscure wisdom and corrupt the will." This teaches us to protect ourselves, to protect our pure and kind hearts. This is extremely important! Nowadays, children are exposed to so many defiling things. Their entire minds are blocked by these things, and they are plagued with evil thoughts, making it impossible for them to calm their minds and study. In a lecture by Dr. Peng Xin, he mentioned that a top-performing student, because of reading pornographic materials, eventually destroyed his health. He was once a backbone player on the soccer team, but he became emaciated. When he went to see Dr. Peng at around twenty-five years old, he looked like an old man because his entire kidney function was nearly destroyed. Therefore, teaching *Standards for Students* (Di Zi Gui) can possibly save a child’s life.

Confucius reminds us, “A gentleman has three things to be wary of: when young, the blood and qi are not yet settled, guard against lust.” If our nation does not awaken, many of our children's futures could be destroyed by the word "lust". Why do children “lose their ambition to play things and lose virtue to play with people?” Because, from a young age, they have not developed a sense of responsibility and filial piety; they lack righteousness, and they have no goals in life. They live one day at a time, so “establishing aspirations for learning” is very important.

In our nation, everyone knows from birth that they should bring honor to their family and ancestors. I previously mentioned that I met a teacher, Mr. Su, who is the 28th-generation descendant of the scholar Su Dongpo and the 72nd-generation descendant of Su Wu. When one reads their family tree like this, they would not dare to fail their ancestors and their family legacy by being disloyal, right? People must seek their roots and inherit their ancestors’ virtues. One day, I was looking at an ethics textbook compiled by Mr. Cai Zhenshen, which was published in the early years of the Republic of China. At the very beginning, he included the teachings of our Cai clan ancestor, Cai Zhong, which moved me deeply. Then it mentioned that we are descendants of King Wen of Zhou. After reading that passage, I felt even my steps were different, not like I walked with the wind, but more like: I couldn't even walk in a way that would embarrass my ancestors. King Wen of Zhou was “caring for the people as if they were his wounds,” displaying benevolence and love. Since we are engaged in education, we should treat our children with such care; that kind of heart is extremely tender.

I remember seeing a moral model being chosen in 2011, a woman from Hunan. She lost both her parents when she was young. At the age of twelve, while collecting cinders by a train track (because of their poverty), she was accidentally run over by a train and lost both her legs. At the age of eighteen, she was sent to a welfare center. Her life had become utterly tragic. Yet, she told the staff that she wanted to care for the children. The staff was surprised. "You can't even care for yourself, who else could you care for?" But she began practicing walking using wooden stools under her arms. She walked like this for 30-40 years and had broken dozens of those heavy wooden stools. In thirty-seven years, she had taken care of 138 children; she was a mother to 138 children. Later, the organization wanted to promote her to a full government position, but she refused, saying she did not take a single salary from the welfare center. She said, "I was sent to the welfare center and found a home. I am grateful for this home. They are all my children.” Therefore, she would not accept a salary.

She mentioned that many of the children sent to the welfare center had congenital disabilities, even having abnormal facial features. Sometimes they drooled uncontrollably. While she was feeding the children, their saliva would unintentionally drip onto her hands or even onto her face when she held them. She said she would never wipe it away at that moment, because the children's hearts were fragile. They had congenital issues and had been abandoned by their families, so she always tried to understand their hearts and was very close to them. I feel that all of us in the educational field should emulate her. Her name is Ms. Xu Yuehua, and her heart was so tender that she could constantly sympathize with the children.

Therefore, when we consider the lifetime of a child, we must understand what virtues to cultivate in them and what deficiencies to remedy. Currently, the situation of children being defiled by various media and books is very serious. Therefore, we should show children Dr. Peng Xin’s lectures about health from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine, to help prevent them from being tempted by lustful content. When they understand it, they won't be misled.

Finally, “Do not abandon yourself, do not give up hope; both sages and worthies can be achieved through persistent effort.” We must teach children to constantly encourage themselves and give themselves strength, and not to be discouraged. Furthermore, we must study the spirit of *The Doctrine of the Mean*: "If another can do it once, we will do it a hundred times." "If another can do it ten times, we will do it a thousand times." If we truly have such determination and perseverance, “if one can truly follow this path, even a fool will become wise,” even someone who is naturally dull-witted will become intelligent. “Even the weak will become strong,” even someone naturally weak will become independent and strong. "Diligence can compensate for clumsiness."

We mentioned earlier, where does children's motivation to learn come from? What we observe is that parents often say, “If you get a hundred on the test, I will give you such and such amount of money.” I don’t know what the going rate is across the country, but here we can probably get an idea across a dozen or so provinces. If you are sensitive to educational issues, you will realize what? Children are taking exams for money, or for a sense of responsibility? If it's the former, that's trouble. Why is it trouble? In elementary school, if they get a hundred on one subject, they ask for fifty yuan; when they go to middle school, they ask for an “increase,” saying fifty yuan is not enough, now they want seventy or eighty yuan and even negotiate. Then in high school, they want even more. And then comes college entrance exams, they set conditions beforehand, “If you want me to get good scores, you must promise to let me go to Germany for a month after the exam.” The fundamental motivation here is entirely self-serving and profit-driven.

Everyone, please be calm. Sending children to college is not the end of the process, that's not the finish line. If you have been driving them for over ten years based on such utilitarian principles, then after they go to college, will there be anything more attractive than money? What is that? The allure of women, gambling, and video games. There are many hotels near universities, which indicates that college students are becoming morally degenerate. They are squandering the blessings of their lives. And not small blessings either. The rate of underage and unmarried abortions has exceeded more than half, which is the situation that our students will have to face in the near future. Therefore, if you don't work from the fundamental values of filial piety and responsibility, no matter where you push them, problems will arise eventually. After pushing them into college, they will not be able to resist the temptations that are even more enticing, and it will be over. And even if they do graduate with a degree, what does it really mean? So many university graduates lock themselves up at home playing video games, unwilling to find work, because they have no sense of responsibility. Then haven't we, the parents and teachers, worked in vain? Therefore, we must grasp the fundamental issues. A child with no sense of responsibility will be irresponsible at work and worry their families. They might marry and not take care of their children, leaving the burden entirely on the elders. Therefore, it is not right if we don’t "cultivate virtue and remedy deficiencies."

We previously mentioned to everyone that one should always put their life on a scale. If a couple is unhappy, do not rush their daughter into marriage. What should they do? They should first teach their daughter *Standards for Students* and Chinese culture, so that she will understand the proper way to be a wife, right? Yes, nowadays some parents say their daughter has a terrible temper, and they quickly want to marry her off. This is a lack of professional ethics. Parents are a sacred profession; their role is to nurture good people for the world. Therefore, parents and teachers must think about how to have a harmonious marital life and set a good example for future generations.

Furthermore, we must ask ourselves, are we happy in our lives? And how can we become happier, so that we do not lead our children down the wrong paths that we took? I feel that in my own educational journey, my heart was straying. For example, when a classmate didn't do well on a test, I would look at their score and feel happy, which is called taking pleasure in another's misfortune. It wasn’t enough just to feel that way. I would also take my own test and walk up to that classmate, showing it off, saying, "Oh, I didn't study much either, but I just happened to do better than you." This is called kicking someone when they are down, and it's bad karma. When I saw that a classmate did better than me, I would think, "What's so great, they just got lucky." Even while thinking this, I would pretend, "Oh, congratulations, you did well." This is called hypocrisy, saying one thing and thinking another. Once you become hypocritical, you will be diminishing your blessings in everything that you do, because blessings are cultivated by the heart; going against your sincerity diminishes blessings. Therefore, you see me being so thin, it is not by chance. It is the result of the bad seeds I planted two or three decades ago. So now I need to work hard to accumulate merits and good deeds. Maybe in ten years, I will become fat and healthy. Through these personal experiences, I understand that these mental biases caused me to torment myself. When negative thoughts arise, they harm my body and mind, diminish my blessings, and bring no benefit to others.

A person's growth requires the companionship of parents and teachers. It requires parents and teachers to seize important opportunities for moral education. When distributing test papers, this is an excellent opportunity for moral education. Today, when facing children who did well on the test, where should their hearts be directed towards regarding the idea of "doing well"? First, toward gratitude. For the nurturing of their parents, the teaching of their many teachers, and the help of their classmates, they should always have a heart of gratitude. Every time they do well, they should think about who helped them, and they will understand humility, thinking, "It's all because of so and so's help, not my own achievement." When we went to Sri Lanka, the president there was not willing to have his photo put on pins, and asked instead if they could use his parents' photos. He was always mindful that his parents were the reason for his existence, and he did not dare take credit.

Our ancestors understood. In *The Doctrine of the Mean*, it says: “When the father is a scholar and the son is a high official, the father should be buried with the rituals for a scholar, but should be worshiped every year with the rituals for a high official.” Why? To tell the world that the deceased has left behind a pillar of talent, and every year, one should worship them with gratitude for their contribution. Therefore, the characteristic of our Chinese nation includes “knowing and repaying kindness, and remembering the source of one’s blessings.” And so it is, we can teach children through the exam process.

Furthermore, if a child does well, we must cultivate his heart of benevolence. He should proactively help classmates who do not understand. Of course, teachers must lead by example; teachers should also proactively help others. Dear principals and teachers, our words and actions are observed by the children. I did not realize that each time I led the class, I would bow and greet our colleagues enthusiastically. Half a year passed before I discovered that people were saying, "Your students are so polite." It turned out that as we bowed, the children were also slowly observing and beginning to show respect to these teachers. Then the relationship between us teachers became increasingly close and the atmosphere between our respective classes also became more harmonious. Therefore, the influence of teachers is tremendous. If teachers proactively help students who are not doing as well academically, then the teachers are demonstrating benevolence, and children, with their pure hearts, can especially feel it. They immediately sense the teacher's love and are thus motivated to help classmates who are struggling.

I remember a teacher who said that his own teachers were very loving. During vacations, they would call students who did not do as well academically into their homes for extra tutoring, and they would also eat together. He was a good student who joined them because he liked being near his teachers. One teacher’s love can awaken the love in so many children. Conversely, if a teacher is biased, showing favoritism towards the good students and ignoring the poor students, the entire class will become mentally biased. This is a problem and a misuse of the teaching profession. The good students become more arrogant, and the poor students become more self-deprecating, or even what? Hating the teacher. What will they become after hating the teacher? Anti-social.

The people whom one respects most are parents and teachers. When parents and teachers do things that harm them, the children will be most hurt. Eventually, their hearts become distorted, and then they exhibit anti-social behavior. It is impossible for someone who loves their parents and respects their teachers to become anti-social. We see these children venting their anger, setting fire to a few motorcycles, and we feel that they are terrible. But these were originally innocent children. How did they become like this? Isn't it worthwhile for our family education, school education, and social education to reflect on this? Therefore, teachers should cultivate a heart of benevolence.

Look, the teacher can tell children: “Dear children, there is a very precious truth in the world: ‘Giving of wealth brings wealth.’ In history, there was a man named Tao Zhu Gong, the God of Wealth, have you heard of this story?” When you’ve already told it, and your students don't respond, don't be upset, because scientists say that it takes telling a story twenty-one times for it to be remembered. So if there is no response, it's only reminding us that we haven't reached twenty-one times yet. Actually, it doesn’t matter whether you're upset. It's about whether our own mindset is adjusted. So it's not the wind moving, or the flag moving, it is our own mind that is moving that is the root of the problem. People with self-cultivation can still be tolerant when facing extremely vile individuals; those without self-cultivation always find fault with others. So it’s not the outside world that is the problem, but the problem with our own minds. Including when we are dealing with the good students, you must teach them to approach exams with a calm mind, otherwise their need to win or lose becomes too severe.

We mentioned previously, when teachers tell them that “Giving of wealth brings wealth,” we should also give them a historical example. "Giving of the Dharma brings wisdom and intelligence." What is the Dharma? The questions you can answer, your good experiences, the learned sayings, doing your best to help others; your wisdom will grow higher and higher. But frankly, when a teacher explains this concept, students may not all receive it equally. Why? Because it's related to the degree to which the teacher has achieved this concept. If you do it 100% of the time, what you say will be deeply felt by students; If we are talking about it while having our own doubts, the impact is far weaker.

For example, when I was in a cram school after graduating from college, in order to take the teacher’s exam, I still had to study for one year. And the exam wasn’t easy. There were only about seven or eight people out of one hundred who could pass. However, I was not afraid. Why? Because if I could not pass in one year, I would try for two years; if I couldn’t pass in two, I would try for three; if I could not pass in three, I would try for four. In any case, I wouldn't turn back. I would pursue my career in education to the very end. Therefore, I was not afraid; sooner or later, I would pass the exam. Furthermore, most people had boyfriends or girlfriends, but I didn’t. I could focus my efforts; this was my advantage. Also, there was something else they didn’t understand: I had the protection of my ancestors. Because I wanted to pursue a career in education, and I wanted to promote Chinese culture, my ancestors would protect me, so I passed the exam very smoothly after about four months. So it's true, as Lao Tzu said, "The Way of Heaven has no favorites, but is always with the good." Because we only did a little bit of good, our ancestors' response was extremely noticeable. It encouraged us and stopped us from extinguishing our small flame of good intentions.

Furthermore, “giving fearlessness brings health and longevity.” If you cherish life, “benevolent people live long,” you will have longevity. Because each thought you have that cherishes people and cherishes life, your own body and mind will first exist in harmony. You can also tell them: “The answers of life are found in water,” a good intention will result in your body’s 70% water crystallizing in beautiful formations. How could one with that kind of internal harmony not be healthy?

When we do not seize these educational opportunities, good students become arrogant and do not know humility. After becoming arrogant, they will take pleasure in others’ misfortunes. Furthermore, the need to win or lose will become increasingly severe. To what extent? I once heard from a graduate student who now teaches in a university that he had always been first in his class from elementary school to university. Later, when he went to graduate school, where all the best and brightest gathered, his grades fell to the middle. He said that after the exams, he was walking down the hallway feeling so depressed that he felt an impulse to jump off a building. This was something I heard personally from a university teacher. But each time he had this impulse, he would think of his mother and grandmother. What saved him? Filial piety. So many people have this filial piety, and so they do not seek to end their own lives, or do not become corrupt and greedy.

There is a very serious case of smuggling in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, in which one official was also struggling many times. He truly could not control himself, but he was stopped by one thought. Because his father was an elementary school teacher, and he valued his reputation so greatly, if he were to become corrupt, and if that matter were to come to light, his father would rather die than live with the shame. This would be like him killing his father with his own hands, so he didn't dare. He originally had plans that he would just serve a few years, and that his child's college tuition would then be covered. Frankly, were those plans correct or not? They were incorrect. First, civil servants are paid using the taxes of over ten billion people, people’s hard-earned money. To be so corrupt is to commit a great sin. "If a family accumulates evil deeds, there will be lingering misfortune." This would affect their children and descendants. So, his plans were completely misguided.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and natural flow.

**Title: The Inevitable Link Between Ill-Gotten Gains and Calamity, and the Power of Filial Piety**

The principle that ill-gotten gains are inevitably followed by misfortune is a classic teaching.  The reason this man escaped a major disaster was his filial piety. When he discussed this matter, he shared that now, during the Mid-Autumn Festival and Chinese New Year, he can happily reunite with his parents, siblings, and family, a blessing entirely due to his practice of filial piety. Otherwise, he would already be in prison.

This university professor’s story offers us a valuable lesson: that high-achieving children may well harbor unhealthy psychological states, particularly concerning gains and losses. Therefore, we must help them cultivate a calm, balanced perspective.  Exams should be viewed as opportunities for self-reflection on one’s learning habits and as a chance to adjust one’s attitudes.  These adjusted attitudes will stay with you for life, enabling continuous academic improvement and success in your future endeavors.

Furthermore, there is another significant problem that can arise from academic achievement: jealousy. High achievers want to excel themselves, so when others perform better, they become unhappy. A person with a jealous heart cannot be happy, no matter how much wealth or status they attain. At this point, we must help that person transform their jealousy into emulation of the virtuous. As the saying goes, “Upon seeing goodness in others, one must aspire to equal it.” Such a transformation makes a world of difference in one’s life.  Those who emulate the virtuous will experience daily growth in virtue and reduction in faults, as they constantly absorb the strengths of others. However, those consumed by jealousy are perpetually in conflict with others, always scheming. Such individuals will ultimately lack blessings.  I remember reading in *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims*, “When others experience joy, do not harbor jealousy.” When someone does well on an exam, we should congratulate them and learn from their strengths.  “When others suffer misfortune, do not harbor gloating.” When someone does not perform well, we must offer comfort, rather than thinking with delight, “Ah, great! They did worse than I did.”

For those who do not perform well on exams, how do we guide them to have a proper mindset? This is where we focus on nurturing their strengths and correcting their shortcomings, helping them to develop self-reflection and self-examination.  Was it due to carelessness, or cramming? Carelessness indicates a lack of focus, a violation of the *Disciple’s Rules* which state: “Heart, eyes, and mouth, sincerity is key." Was it due to cramming? This indicates the absence of a balanced approach, as reflected in the saying: "Set broad limits, use effort diligently; when effort is enough, obstacles dissolve.”  Did I lack focus in class? Did I fail to actively seek clarification from the teacher? “When in doubt, jot it down immediately.” This exam can serve as a catalyst for students to reflect on these issues and make necessary corrections. These corrections, these attitudes, will accompany them throughout their life, a truly invaluable asset.

So, how does one change their destiny? We should teach children from a young age, “You have the ability to change your destiny.”  Take the example of Mr. Liao Fan, who extended his lifespan by 21 years, was given children where he had none, and went from a life without fortune or status to becoming the magistrate of a large county. These examples give children confidence. The key is to break bad habits and “make the change of habits the foundation of life.”

We recognize that Zen Master Yun Gu was a great mentor, guiding Mr. Liao Fan to transform his destiny. Furthermore, his approach to education demonstrated great wisdom and method.  You see how he patiently explained things to Mr. Liao Fan, just as the *Book of Rites* instructs, “Guide without pulling.” He gently led Mr. Liao Fan towards understanding and growth. He would “encourage without suppressing.” He always encouraged Mr. Liao Fan, never putting him down. He would say, “Even for our physical bodies, there are limitations. How can the body dedicated to righteousness fail to reach the heavens?” He continuously encouraged him: “You can absolutely do it!” He also would “enlighten without forcing.” He would stimulate his thinking, rather than blocking his path to realization. If we just force-feed information, the child will become unable to think or comprehend. Notice how Zen Master Yun Gu enlightened him? Mr. Liao Fan said he was destined to have no son and unable to obtain a government position.  Zen Master Yun Gu then asked him to reflect: “Do you think that you deserve to obtain a government position? Do you think you deserve to have a son?” This gentle questioning encouraged him to reflect. “I contemplated this for a long time,” Mr. Liao Fan said, admitting to himself that he was not deserving. He immediately spoke out: “I am unable to obtain a government position because those who do so are blessed. I have little innate blessing, I don't know to accumulate merit, and I also have a terrible temper and constantly yell at people." He had voiced it himself! This is an example of “enlightening without forcing,” prompting him to engage in self-examination.  Through that self-examination, Mr. Liao Fan fully grasped his shortcomings and began to correct them, thus transforming his destiny. This dialogue is truly valuable for those in the field of education to reflect upon. He was a truly outstanding teacher.

Students who engage in self-reflection and self-examination will also form a valuable attitude, specifically: “Rather than focusing on the reasons why I cannot do something, focus on solutions and methods to make it happen.” When a student doesn't do well on an exam, you can support them in considering ways to improve, and the whole class can engage in this reflective process. Encourage them to aspire to improvement.  It's okay: “If others achieve it with one effort, I will try one hundred; if others achieve it with ten efforts, I will try one thousand.” Remind them that they can proactively seek guidance from teachers and observe how successful students approach learning, how they listen in class, and how they apply themselves. In this way, they will learn “to emulate the virtuous.”  This is how you should guide a student who does not perform well on an exam.  When a student does not perform well but receives no guidance, what will be the outcome? They may become discouraged, give up, and settle for mediocrity.  They may become jealous of others. It is not good. Therefore, we must consider the long-term view and focus on developing kindness, filial piety, and a sense of responsibility. We must also address every instance, even a single exam, with the goal of nurturing strengths and correcting shortcomings. When students fight, you must still nurture strengths and correct shortcomings.  When students show good behavior, we must still nurture strengths and correct shortcomings. Why?  Because "by observing one another, we become good," and “praising the good in others is itself a virtue; when others are aware, they strive even harder.” Teachers serve as role models for their students, and high-achieving students within a class serve as good examples for the entire class. The attitude of emulating the virtuous will become the class culture.

From the outset, when discussing teaching, the goal of a teacher should be “to cultivate talent for the world” and “nurture strengths and correct shortcomings." Their purpose should not be merely to earn a salary, for that is what merits respect. If the goal is just salary, what would be the difference between a teacher and a common merchant?  Indeed, in many cases, even merchants possess a greater sense of educational mission than some teachers.  I recently heard someone say, “Schools are becoming businesses, and businesses are becoming schools.” Why are schools becoming businesses? Many graduate students now address their professors as “bosses.” Hasn't it turned into a business?  Yet, now many businesses, such as the Jumei Xin Ye company with their leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Ye, they have a strong sense of social responsibility and use their factories as a place to provide ethics and morality education. Isn't that a business turning into a school? So the reason many business people are respected today is not a coincidence. Those of us in education should not blame others for not being respected, but instead should have self-respect and self-love. We should uphold the spirit of intellectuals and teachers from thousands of years ago.

Learners must also "nurture strengths and correct shortcomings."  When we first discussed the goal of students, it is also to develop their virtue and "nurture strengths and correct shortcomings", and also "studying should be with the goal of becoming a sage.”  They must constantly elevate themselves, aiming to become sages. What is the goal of students today? (Answer: to make money). That is misguided. Instead of striving to fulfill their duty to family and society, they have become focused on personal gain, setting them on a path of many personal, family, and health-related problems.  This is why we began by analyzing that the root of all problems is that people's values have become dominated by material desires, which ultimately leads to these consequences.

Moreover, the goal of students is to gain wisdom. As stated in the *Great Learning*: "When you know where you should rest, you will have a direction; with a direction, you can be at peace; with peace, you can be calm; with calm, you can be thoughtful; with thought, you can obtain true knowledge." Therefore, studying traditional culture will lead to ever-greater wisdom. The “rest” refers to resting in the pursuit of becoming a sage. “Resting in the highest good” is the goal of life. When your direction is set, you will not be distracted, and every step will be in that direction. If you have established your intention, your heart will be clear and your mind will be at peace.  If a person pursues material desires, they will constantly desire one thing after another and will not be able to calm their mind. When the mind is calm, all circumstances, both positive and negative, will be seen as opportunities to grow and refine oneself, allowing one to live peacefully amid all trials.  When encountering adverse circumstances, what will they think? “Heaven is about to bestow a great responsibility upon this person.” They will realize that Heaven thinks highly of them, becoming increasingly courageous. With such an attitude, they will not be swayed by their environment, and they will be at peace in all circumstances, feeling serene. Once a person is settled and calm, then they are "able to attain stability from adhering to precepts."  As we just mentioned, “A gentleman has three precepts,” these are guidelines for how to be a good person. “Without rules, there can be no order.” When rules are in place, their hearts are settled, knowing how to conduct themselves at all times. With stability derived from adhering to precepts, they will not be tempted by wealth, beauty, fame, or fine food. "Wealth and honor will not corrupt them, poverty and hardship will not move them, and power and force will not subdue them." When a person reaches a certain level of stability, their original virtue will be restored, and they will gain wisdom.

We have a famous person in China, Sixth Patriarch Huineng, who, after achieving enlightenment, spoke with the wisdom of the sages.  Another example from the early years of the Republic of China is Elder Wang Shanren, a man from Northeastern China, who promoted Chinese culture, especially the virtues of women. Though he was illiterate, he practiced filial piety and brotherhood to the greatest extent. He observed principles. His mind was always focused on his parents and siblings and he was not tempted by external desires.  Ultimately, he became selfless and altruistic. He sought to save one good person and his wisdom manifested, leading him to teach the *Great Learning* and the *Doctrine of the Mean*. Compare this to our children now, who lack any sense of stability. When they handle issues, they do so impulsively and without wisdom. Therefore, the goal of learning should be to gain wisdom. And again, if we as principals and teachers gain wisdom through our own learning, our colleagues and students will envy and naturally follow suit.

Next, our second foundation for teaching is to teach our students how to live a moral life, teaching them how to fulfill their duties to others, and about the relationships between family members. As we teach them about these relationships, we should teach them to conduct themselves using the Eight Virtues. "There is no person outside of relationships.” No one is separate from the five fundamental relationships: parent-child, husband-wife, siblings, ruler-minister, and friends.  When these five relationships are in harmony, people will be happy and accomplish much. If we lack the foundation of teaching these fundamental human relationships, then our society may well become based on utilitarianism. People may become overly focused on personal gain. If we were to survey university graduates, what is their first thought? Would they think, “Fantastic, I'm 22 now and I finally have the chance to repay my country and my parents”? No. Those with the foundation of teaching human relationships would think this way, but now, many people think, “I need to make a million, so I can have a good time!” This is a purely utilitarian mindset. Therefore, we must be clear on where the foundation of our education should be, and its goal.

The content of education should include the teaching of ethics, morality, and cause and effect.  These Eight Virtues I’m afraid we lack the time to discuss today. To all principals and education colleagues, I have three additional topics for you: “Reviving the Teacher’s Path,” “The Importance of Self-Education,” and “The Great Teacher Confucius as a Model.” I will be returning to Malaysia today, and there I will share these topics and make recordings for Jumei Xin, which they can then share with you for your reference. As the *Disciple’s Rules* states, "When making a promise, always keep it."  Since I promised to discuss these topics, I feel obligated to do so.

What we have just discussed is the third key aspect: the content of education. These are the focal points. Ethics and morality lead people to be ashamed of wrongdoing. The teaching of cause and effect - planting good causes yields good results, planting bad causes yields bad results – leads people to not dare to do wrong, especially in the practice of filial piety and the performance of good deeds which should not be delayed. This is the proper content of education. We must understand the fundamental importance of things, teaching people not only knowledge but also how to be good people, because to only teach knowledge puts the cart before the horse. "Virtue and talent must both be developed." With virtue, the knowledge and talents that a person has are guided by their virtue. Without virtue, knowledge and talent may lead one to be unfilial to their parents at home and disrespectful to leaders at work. Therefore, the adage goes, “virtue and talent must be both developed.” It doesn’t say, “talent and virtue must be both developed.”

We have all had leadership experience, and if I may offer you one observation about leadership, I think you may also share this feeling. “A good character is far more valuable than extraordinary talent.”  In managing so many cadres, have you encountered people who are very talented, but have huge tempers, are arrogant, difficult to work with, and for whom you, as the principal, must always intervene? Though they are talented, their behavior causes so much trouble for everyone. A person with good character who is respectful of others and thoughtful of their needs, may not be very capable, but because they are willing to learn, they will gradually improve. However, an arrogant person, no matter how talented, will have an extremely difficult time shedding their arrogance. Only through understanding true principles will they ever change, and this takes time.

This is the content. Now, let's discuss the fourth key aspect: the spirit of education. The spirit of education is to "teach according to the aptitude of the students" and recognize that "every profession has its exceptional people." Instead of forcing everyone into one narrow path of solely focusing on exams, we, as teachers, must understand that it is our duty to "teach according to the aptitude of the students," and that "every profession has its exceptional people."  Instead, what has happened? We have turned students into exam machines. What do these exam machines become after graduation? Work machines. They don't know how to live their lives, or how to relate to their spouses. There is a big issue in Taiwan: “High education leads to high divorce rates.” I saw a newspaper that stated this.  People may talk endlessly about their professional research, but they don't know how to communicate with their partners or others.  Their life will still be filled with suffering. When students are turned into exam machines, their capacity for understanding is blocked. But if you teach them based on moral character, their capacity for understanding will only grow. The more talent they possess, the better they can serve others.  In 2011, I saw that a model of morality, a descendant of Confucius, was breaking records in innovation and invention. He was very intelligent and used his professional abilities very well. But more importantly, he had the virtue of service. Now, some people design violent video games. Do they have innovation? Yes, but how much harm do they do to the children? They do not understand that this is harmful.

Furthermore, another very important element of the spirit of education is “teaching without discrimination.” We must believe that every child has inherent goodness, and treat them equally. Any form of discrimination makes all the children ill. Moreover, education is for the development of people, not the abandonment of people.  If we in education cannot uphold the belief of “teaching without discrimination,” we may allow our entire social atmosphere to become tainted, resulting in the abandonment of students. If we give up on students who do not perform well on exams, I would be the first to be abandoned. You must have pity on me! My grades were not very good, so I am a “late-bloomer.”

Children all have inherent virtue, and they will all awaken, though at different times. We must have faith in this. On what basis must we believe in our students? “Those who wish to love others must first love themselves.” Those who wish to trust others, must first trust themselves. If you spend all your time with yourself, and you don't trust yourself, whom can you trust? Your trust will waver constantly.  Principals and teachers, do you have faith? Yes. Do you have faith sometimes or at all times?  At all times. I bow to you in respect.  I used to be a person lacking in self-confidence, which is why I would ask others, “What do you think of me?” That lack of confidence was a great disservice to myself.  Usually, when faced with difficult situations, if you have faith, “Nothing is difficult to those with resolve,” and “sincerity will open stone and metal.” But, lacking faith, even simple things will crumble. As soon as a person thinks, “I can't do it, I am not capable, I am just this way,” they will constantly fall backwards, and everything will fall apart.

To build faith, we cannot build it on a foundation that is constantly changing. For example, if my faith is built on what others think of me, will my faith not disappear? If one day a person says good things about me, and the next day they say bad things about me, will I not deflate like a flat tire? So our faith should not be based on that. Even the same person may say good things about you one day and bad things the next. Then you would have no faith in yourself! Our faith should not be based on external conditions, either.  For example, I was very lacking in faith for a period because, in junior high, I was only about 150 centimeters tall. Compared to the girls in my class, who were all taller than me, I always felt inferior and thus lacked confidence. Therefore, faith should absolutely not be built upon external material things or conditions, as then your faith will constantly disappear.  For example, if you think, “Wow, my black hair is so beautiful,” but then you discover two gray hairs, you’ll cry for three days, losing your confidence!

So where should we build our faith? On truth, on the reality of the universe and life. Every person has inherent goodness and inherent virtue. Your faith will not waver when you believe this.  Since understanding this truth, I have never denied myself, or fought against myself. Now, I only think about how I can improve myself. I no longer doubt myself. Because of this faith, I dare to share traditional culture with everyone. If I were still that student who scored second to last in Chinese class, and who failed the Chinese portion of the college entrance exam, I would not be here! Principals and education colleagues, I doubt if any of you have ever scored so poorly! But since I know that our ancestors would never lie, I would not deny myself again, and I began to consider how I could improve. My teachers taught me, “Sincerity will reach the heavens.” You can study and share the teachings of the classics with a sincere heart, as if you had divine assistance. Do not be afraid. I knew that the classics would not lie, and my teachers would not lie, so I have faith and courage, and gradually, my potential began to be realized.

That is all I have for this session. I would also like to wish you all, principals and education colleagues, good health. It is very important. Good health is the most important thing. We must rely on you all to help revive Chinese culture. So, first, take good care of your health. Especially, principals, you must take the lead in maintaining your health, and you must care about the health of your colleagues.  Second, I would also like to wish you all harmonious families, and that your families can carry on for the next 2,500 years, just as we have the best model in Confucius. Thank you, everyone!


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided text, striving for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**Lecture 7: The Dignity of the Teacher's Path: 1. The Importance of Teachers**

Respected elders, esteemed colleagues in the field of education, and fellow alumni, good morning!

It’s been a while. I recently returned to mainland China at the beginning of July. Coincidentally, the Ministry of Education had an educational project, which was jointly organized with Jumeixin in Nanjing, to train school principals during the summer. Over one hundred school principals and kindergarten directors participated in the four-day program, which left a deep impression on me. I felt that the circumstances of life are often shaped by our own intentions, and especially when those intentions are to benefit others, they are very likely to be fulfilled. As the saying goes, "When a person has good intentions, Heaven will surely respond," and Lao Tzu also said, "Heaven is impartial, but always favors the good." Furthermore, in these times, even a small act of kindness receives great blessings from our wise ancestors, protecting not only us, but also our families. This has been palpable in the experiences of my colleagues and their families for many years.

Before I went to Haikou on the mainland, which was the first place I shared traditional culture, I read a report in a Taiwanese newspaper about Falun Gong. It claimed that "Falun Gong is a practice higher than Buddhism." However, through studying the teachings of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, I understand that Buddhism emphasizes equality; the Buddha sees all sentient beings as potential Buddhas. Therefore, that claim proves that the person making it had a fundamental misunderstanding of Buddhism. The ability to discern is essential, otherwise, we can be severely misled. Especially in this age where "false teachers expound the Dharma like grains of sand on the Ganges," we must have the ability to make sound judgments and use classical scriptures as our standard. When I saw those people who were willing to give up their lives for their practice, I was filled with admiration. I thought, if these people had encountered the teachings of the ancient sages, they would be fearless of death; whereas I still fear death, their accomplishments would surely surpass mine. I felt a great sense of pity and thought, "How wonderful it would be if they could encounter the authentic teachings of our ancient sages." I had this thought, and it came to pass.

After that, I went to Haikou for a year, then to Beijing for another year, followed by three years in Lujiang, and five years in Malaysia. I am deeply grateful for the support and trust of the local people during that time, which provided me and my colleagues with a great opportunity to learn and grow. These people have done us a great kindness. It was only after I left that I found out that over half of the people who attended the classes in Haikou had practiced Falun Gong. After learning traditional culture, they became more aware of how they had been misled. I thought to myself, "Never underestimate the power of a single thought."

Later, I had the opportunity to share traditional culture in prisons in Taiwan, which was very impactful. When I went to the women's prison, I was deeply moved by the students (in Taiwan, inmates are referred to as “students”). What shook me the most was that they listened to the two-hour lectures with unwavering focus; not a single one of them was distracted. Why was that so impactful? Because I used to be an elementary school teacher. If their elementary school teachers had taught them the ethics and morals of our ancestors, would they be in prison today? The answer is clear. We had failed in our duty. Of course, I also encouraged them, saying that if they continue to learn with the focus they showed in those two hours, they would surely become sages. "Do not indulge in self-pity, nor give up on yourself; with effort, one can attain sagehood."

Therefore, I feel a deep compassion for these “students” in prison. I saw the truth of “At birth, people are inherently good” in them. However, I also remembered what my teachers said, "Life's experiences vary from person to person.” Thus, in this world, there are only pitiable people, not hateful ones. Why? When we see a person's bad behavior, we should not focus solely on that current behavior. Rather, we must look at the past. They lacked proper education—they lacked a good family education, a good school education, and the love of their parents, teachers, and society. That is why they became the way they are. They are pitiable people. If we look towards the future, if they continue to commit bad deeds, they will suffer endlessly. They are also pitiable.

Therefore, as practitioners, we have a long-term vision. We do not dwell on a single word or action and confront, criticize, or punish them severely. That is not the attitude of a cultivated person. A cultivated person does not fixate on appearances; instead, they look for the root causes. Therefore, "The benevolent have no enemies." A benevolent person will think of others, pity their past, and try their best to help their future. I felt that all of these “students” in prison were truly kind, and I hoped that there would be more opportunities to connect with them through traditional culture. Later, a "Traditional Culture Enters Prisons" program began in Haikou, and I had the opportunity to participate. Our entire team in Haikou, as well as the team from Lujiang, worked together on this program. Indeed, when people have a good intention, it will come to fruition. So, I urge you all to make good vows, and when we see what is right, we should bravely act upon it.

You might say, “But I do not have the ability.” First of all, the very act of generating that intention is very powerful. Perhaps your intention will inspire someone who has the ability. When you express it, perhaps someone capable will be moved by your words. Look at Old Man Bai Fangli. How many people did he inspire to contribute? Did he have money? Did he have better physical strength than us? He had fewer advantages than us in every way. Yet, he dedicated all that he had, and his sincerity moved those who were destined to work together for the education of the next generation. Therefore, never underestimate the power of your own intention.

In 2005, when I was living in Beijing, I shared traditional culture with many universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the Agricultural University. I even shared a semester’s worth of classes at the China University of Geosciences, the alma mater of former Premier Wen. These college students also greatly impressed me with their dedication to learning. I remember how focused the students at the University of Geosciences were during the lectures. You could almost hear a pin drop in the pause between two sentences. Their eagerness to learn was truly touching. Thus, I had the thought that if college students are so willing to learn, then more teachers, entrepreneurs, and successful people should share traditional culture with them. So I told everyone that I met, especially successful entrepreneurs, to teach in universities.

When I was passing through Guangzhou Airport on my way back to Malaysia, I saw in the newspapers that Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong Province (which is the best university in Guangdong) now requires all incoming freshmen to complete 30 hours of volunteer work and study the *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student) before starting classes. Schools are now giving more emphasis to traditional culture. Last October, Datong University in Shanxi Province held a seven-day training program in traditional culture for all incoming freshmen. This is their fifth year doing so, as they started in 2009. They filmed the entire training program last year, and both Teacher Li Yue and I participated. They told us that many universities are now using this video to conduct traditional culture training for their students. I was very happy to hear this, because the intention I had earlier was continuing to develop. So, having good intentions is important; they will come to fruition.

My trip to Nanjing was also because I had an earlier intention. Both my parents graduated from normal colleges. My father from Tainan Normal College. When I was admitted, I joked with my parents that I had been promoted. "Promoted to what?" I had become my parents' junior. Over half of my family works in education, so I felt a sense of responsibility towards the field. But I retired from education ten years ago to focus on sharing traditional culture. I was originally supposed to go to Beijing, but my circumstances changed, and I went to Nanjing instead. I ended up participating in this program, fulfilling another one of my intentions. They also filmed this entire program, so that all of the schools under this project would be able to use this video for their study purposes. I truly cherished this opportunity. The topic I shared with over one hundred school principals and kindergarten directors was “Becoming a Noble Benefactor for a Child's Lifetime.” When I saw these fellow educators, I thought, "fellow educators" is such a wonderful term which I learned in Malaysia. It is perfect to bring back to China. Those who share the same path – those who have the same goal, the same direction, and the same mission – are to revive the integrity of the teacher’s path, revitalize Chinese culture, and restore the integrity of intellectuals. In ancient times, intellectuals were highly respected, ranking first among scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Why were they respected? Because they took the well-being of the entire world as their responsibility.

When I looked at these educators, I saw not just over one hundred people, but at least two hundred thousand people, because each principal leads a school with sometimes thousands of students. They are currently influencing those two hundred thousand, and they will continue to educate for another ten or twenty years. How many students and families will they influence? Quite a lot. Why do I say “students and families”? Because it is very clear that it is more important to educate parents than to educate children. Parents can use their own behavior as a guide, and can better cooperate with teachers to educate students. If they do not understand, and contradict what the teachers are trying to do, wouldn't that be counterproductive?

Educators understand education and the value of traditional culture in education. But now, the transmission of traditional culture in the entire Chinese world has been broken for two or three generations. Even if the family has an influence, there is no systematic teaching of the classics. There is only some indirect influence, and for our generation, even that influence is very weak, because we don't understand it anymore. So, to turn the tide, we must rely on those who understand education. Elementary, middle, and kindergarten teachers all understand education; therefore, we cannot shirk our responsibilities. If we fail to educate the next generation, our society will have no future! "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every citizen," let alone the educators who are paid by taxpayers. We are paid by taxpayers to be responsible for our country, our people, and whether our next generation will have the talent that it needs. This is why teachers are known as the "engineers of the human soul." Whether the next generation has a soul, this is the teacher's duty.

During the four days, we focused on four key points. The first is to discuss and explain the topic "Becoming a Noble Benefactor for a Child’s Lifetime." The deeper we understand the topic, the better we will be at receiving knowledge. For example, I remember in Haikou, a woman walked into the classroom. It happened to be during our first “Happiness in Life Lecture” which was a five-day training program in July of 2004. She hadn’t signed up for the program. She may have just walked in because she was passing by. There was a copy of the *Teacher's Handbook* on the table. She picked it up, saw that it contained *Di Zi Gui*, and said, “Oh, *Di Zi Gui*, that’s for children.” She put it down and left. She only understood the *Di Zi Gui* at a superficial level.

What does "Di Zi" (disciple) mean? At home, we are disciples of our parents; at school, we are disciples of our teachers; in society, we are disciples of our leaders. In every field, we need to learn from a mentor. Within the entire nation, we are all disciples of our ancestors and sages. So, the term “disciple” is very broad. Only if we are good disciples, can we absorb the wisdom and experience of our parents, teachers, leaders, and ancestors. Who should not learn from them? Those who do not study the *Di Zi Gui* do not have the right attitude of a disciple, and will not be able to inherit the wisdom of their parents, teachers, leaders, and ancestors. If they don't listen to the elders, they will suffer. Therefore, those who do not study the *Di Zi Gui* are bound to suffer. Had she known that not learning it would cause her to suffer, she wouldn't have left. So, explaining this title is our first key point.

"Becoming a Noble Benefactor for a Child’s Lifetime": When do we start? Who should do it? How do we do it? To what extent should we do it? These are all very important questions. When we understand all of these things clearly, our learning will become very different. Why? Because once we understand, we will see how important each sentence is for ourselves, and not just something we tell other people. When do we start? Right now. (After returning to Malaysia, I’m inclined to speak a little English). We must start right away, because we are constantly influencing ourselves, as well as the people around us. "Studying is like rowing upstream; if you do not advance, you will be swept back." This is loving ourselves. If we don't act immediately, we are not loving ourselves. Secondly, it is about loving others. If we are not doing the right thing ourselves, how can we become a noble benefactor to others? Therefore, we must act immediately and have this sense of responsibility. This is how we can truly live up to the relationships with our family, friends, and students, and all of those who are connected with us. This is what it means to live righteously.

Who should do it? Rulers, parents, and teachers all have a role to play. Rulers are leaders; parents are elders and family members; teachers are our educators. Furthermore, everyone should participate, because we all have a responsibility towards our society. When we act on this, the culture will improve because of us, and those who see it will be touched. This is our responsibility; the responsibility of every earthling, every Chinese, and every citizen. So, everyone should be doing this, but especially the roles of rulers, parents, and teachers.

How do we do it? To be a noble benefactor to our children, first, we must be a noble benefactor to ourselves. If we don’t love ourselves, how can we love others? If we do not help ourselves, how can we help others? Therefore, we must first cultivate ourselves and then manage our families. We must first rectify ourselves to be able to transform others. So, how do we do it? The noble person focuses on the root, beginning with the investigation of things, and beginning with self-cultivation. If we want to be a noble benefactor to our children, we must first study the teachings of the sages. We must first become good disciples of the sages, before we can be noble benefactors to others. If we are not good disciples, how can we become good teachers? So, the way to do it is to focus on the root.

To what extent should we do it? Actually, doing it with sincerity is perfection. “Give me three years, give me five years, and I will do such and such.” Actually, sincerity is the key. Old Man Bai Fangli did not have a high education, social status, or wealth, but he simply relied on his sincere heart. So, "It’s impossible to please everyone, but we must have no regrets." If we do our best, our merits will be perfect. Of course, it is even better to have hopes and continuously spur ourselves forward with vigor. This is how we “do.”

"Children": Who are we referring to when we say "children"? From the classics of traditional culture, we can learn the wisdom of reviving the teacher’s path. When we are faced with the word "children," are we only thinking about our own children? Or are we thinking about our students? Or the next generation of the entire nation? Or are we looking at all children in the world? If we look at it objectively, the biggest problem the world is facing is the continuous increase in juvenile crime rates. If the methods of education are right, why can we not produce talented people? The *Rules for Nurturing the Righteous* says, “If the world has true education, then it will have true talent.” There must be the right methods of education in order to produce truly talented people.

In this era, the Chinese people have lost their national confidence. We possess five thousand years of educational wisdom, philosophy, methods, and experiences, which have produced sages generation after generation. Even the Qing dynasty produced a lot of sages. Why is it so difficult to produce even filial sons in our generation? It's because "the moon is always rounder on the other side of the fence," meaning, many people think things in other countries are better. However, the entire Western society is now focused on knowledge and skills, and does not give enough emphasis to morality and ethics, which is putting the branches before the root. Virtue is the root, while wealth and knowledge are the branches. If we invert the root and branches, how can we produce truly talented individuals? But even with that correct understanding, people might not believe us. Therefore, we must set good examples, and produce results.

Songhuajiang Middle School in Jilin Province has been emphasizing ethics and morals. Under the leadership of Principal Lü Jie and Teacher Wang Qi, they have influenced a great number of schools. I believe hundreds of schools have visited their school. Now, several Chinese primary schools in Malaysia, such as Xing Hua Chinese Primary School, are acting as models, and many schools have visited them. This is very important in our times. Therefore, those who have made the greatest contributions to the revival of traditional culture are the ones who have set good examples – schools, families, and organizations. This is the most valuable contribution. Because when they do well, they give all those who are learning or who have not yet started, strong confidence, which cannot be easily shaken by a few words. "Faith is the mother of the path and of merit." Faith is very important.

The mission of the Chinese Academy is very important. We must run a seamless school system. This is a system that entirely follows the traditional culture of our ancestors, educating children from the age of four, for one to two decades. In ancient times, at the age of eighteen, a person could become a magistrate. What can someone do now at eighteen? If they are obedient, that’s good enough. How could they become a magistrate? So if we can follow the teachings of our ancestors and establish this kind of school system, then what is the benefit to “children”? It is to give the entire world confidence in Chinese culture.

Therefore, if we approach the study of traditional culture with a broad mind, and with the next generation’s well-being as our main focus, our absorption of knowledge will be different. When we read the same scripture, or learn from the same book, will the effects of each person’s learning be different? Yes, they will definitely be different. It is not due to the scripture, or the influence of the teacher, but due to each person’s mind and level of awareness. The effects are proportional to it. I will give an analogy that everyone can easily understand. When it rains, for example, in Kuala Lumpur, does Heaven say that a certain area gives me offerings every day, so I’ll give them a lot of rain? Or, that an area doesn't give me offerings, so I'll give them less rain? No. Heaven is fair. And when this life-giving rain falls, the grass absorbs it, and the trees absorb it. But will the amount absorbed be the same? No, it will not. A small tree absorbs only a few drops, while a large tree with deep roots may absorb gallons of water. So, it’s not up to Heaven. Who decides it? These creatures decide it themselves. The bigger the tree, the bigger our mind. Therefore, the more we can absorb. So, do not be envious when other people learn better than you; instead, look at the root. As soon as we become envious, we do not understand how to broaden our minds.

This time when I was on the mainland, I heard a term that I had never heard before, even though it has apparently been popular for a long time. It is “envy, jealousy, and hatred.” The five characters are very interesting. It expresses the changes in a person’s psychology. First, one becomes envious. When envy persists, it turns into, “Humph, what’s so great about them?” Jealousy. When jealousy becomes worse, it turns into hatred. Then, people take action to make trouble for the target. A suitable caption for this is, “Has not studied the Di Zi Gui.” Why? Because it says, “When you see others doing good, you should think of learning from them.” Then people would not develop in this direction. The teachings of the sages are very important. Why? Because everyone is saying these five words. In the end, it is considered normal to have these kinds of reactions, but they are actually not normal. It should be “envy, follow their example, learn from them,” and “be in tune with them.” That is the correct approach. So, Heaven is fair. It all depends on our minds. When we have a larger mind, not only do we receive more blessings, but our wisdom also increases faster, because we are able to absorb more.

“Becoming a Noble Benefactor for a Child’s Lifetime”: How can we become a noble benefactor for a child’s *entire* lifetime? What should parents, teachers, and leaders be focusing on? It's not just their immediate grades, scores, and qualifications; it is focusing on developing in them the most important attitudes of how to conduct themselves and how to handle matters. We must have this kind of vision. It is best to have a vision like that of Fan Zhongyan. Fan planted two pine trees in front of his house, calling them “noble trees.” He was very confident that the family traditions he was passing down would last. He said, "Their shade will be able to protect and shelter future generations." His hope was "for a thousand years," that his descendants would still be protected by the shade of these trees, and would still be following his teachings. Indeed, Fan's descendants are very outstanding. It's been over 800 or 900 years now.

People need to make vows, especially for their families and future generations.


Okay, here is my professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**Fan Gong: A Shining Example, Thinking Beyond a Lifetime, to a Thousand Years**

Fan Gong is a truly admirable example; he didn’t just consider one lifetime, he looked towards a thousand years.  Think of Confucius’ descendants – they’ve thrived for over two thousand five hundred years. Why is it that they possess such great blessings? It’s because of his teachings: “When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all,” and, “Adhering to the legacy of Yao and Shun, following the principles of Wen and Wu.” He carried on the entire lineage of the Dao, immeasurably benefiting all of the Chinese people. Which sage, which Chinese person who understands the principles of living, hasn’t been blessed by Confucius’ influence?  Therefore, regarding this “lifetime,” we must ask ourselves:  As parents and as teachers, are our perspectives deep and far-reaching? Can we see beyond the immediate?

Regarding a "lifelong benefactor," where does the value lie? It lies in constantly thinking about a student's entire life, about their future generations.  This is what is worthy of respect. This is what it means to be a "benefactor." "Those who are content are rich." “People respect you” – when others genuinely respect you from their hearts, that’s what truly makes you honorable. It isn’t just about having a high position where others are outwardly respectful but complain behind your back; that kind of "benefactor" is meaningless.  This is the discussion I'm sharing with everyone on this topic.

The second important point is an encouragement to all educators regarding the meaning of life: “Life is fleeting for all, but leave behind a loyal heart that shines through history.” Our ancient sages have taught us: "The Great Learning teaches us to illuminate our virtuous nature, to love and serve the people, and to strive for the highest good." In fact, this statement perfectly encapsulates the meaning of life. What is the meaning of life? “Illuminating our virtuous nature” means perfecting ourselves, restoring our wisdom, virtue, and blessings, and having self-respect. “Loving and serving the people” means to love others, to love our students, and to love everyone who enters our lives. When we achieve perfection in loving ourselves and others, we achieve "the highest good."

Therefore, when one truly reflects on life, one should leave behind a legacy that lasts, like Confucius’ legacy, which has endured for over two thousand five hundred years. That is what has true meaning. Many leave behind wealth for their children, but it becomes a source of conflict, with siblings fighting over money in court. That shows a lack of wisdom. What we should leave behind are the enduring qualities of virtue and example, and that which we can carry with us. We can’t even take our bodies with us after we die. Has anyone ever taken their body with them upon death? No. If we can’t even take our bodies, how much less can we take material possessions? Yet, many people spend their entire lives, decades, pursuing material wealth that they can’t take with them. They waste their lives and become increasingly greedy in the pursuit.

Therefore, Confucius reminds us, "The superior person has three things to guard against." In youth, "when the vital energy is not yet settled, guard against lust." It is indeed true that if we don't educate young people properly, they will have their bodies and their lives ruined by lust, and their thinking will be corrupted. We must quickly teach them the *Disciple’s Regulations* : “Non-sage books should be avoided; they cloud wisdom and corrupt the will.” “When one is mature and one's vital energy is vigorous, guard against contention."  Instead of appreciating and emulating others, people engage in confrontation, competition, and fighting, creating much negative karma and discord within groups. “In old age,” when "vital energy is declining, guard against acquisitiveness.”  They become anxious and obsessed with gains and losses. They compare their accomplishments in life or boast about how much money their son earns or how high their daughter’s education is. Ah, it’s exhausting. The more they live, the more exhausted they become, the more they struggle to find joy. Without studying the classics, without opening the eye of wisdom, one will only become more degraded.

Therefore, we should strive to leave behind enduring family values, a legacy of virtuous conduct, and carry with us spiritual growth, spiritual wisdom, and good deeds performed throughout our lives. So, the second focus is on the meaning of life. In this present age, people are pitiful because without the guidance of the classics, they are unable to awaken their wisdom. They define the meaning of life as the pursuit of fame, fortune, and desires. The most serious problems in today’s society are materialism and hedonism. Materialism is about "profit," and hedonism is about “desire.” When blinded by profit and desire, people become numb and indifferent, neglecting their wives, children, and parents in their reckless pursuit of gratification. That’s why there are so many modern ailments. They mistreat their bodies and commit so much wrongdoing. How can they expect health and longevity? How can they expect good fortune? The third serious problem is extreme individualism, selfishness, and a complete lack of consideration for others.  Selfishness leads to competition, which leads to conflict, which leads to war. The root of so much conflict in families, organizations, and between countries lies in selfishness. Only by identifying this root cause can we solve these problems. The meaning of life has been completely misunderstood. Therefore, saving souls requires teachers to transmit the Dao, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts.

The third point focuses on analyzing the sufferings of humanity. Where does this suffering come from? It stems from a lack of learning. When people lack knowledge and don't know the meaning of righteousness, the direction of their lives becomes completely degraded.  Effort yields results, but those results may not be good when we are on the wrong path.

Fourthly, knowing the suffering of humanity, we ask, “In this day and age, if not us, then who?”  How can we help society? The fourth point is, “To build a nation and govern the people, education must come first.” A school principal should embrace the principle of "To build a nation and govern the people, education must come first.” "If a superior person wishes to transform customs, he must do so through education."  Parents are "rulers," teaching their "people," their families and children, and "transforming customs" to create their family culture.  A teacher educates students, considering them the "people,” and should educate them properly to "transform customs," creating the atmosphere of the class. A principal educates teachers and students, shaping the school's culture. National leaders should take the lead.  We are very pleased that China Central Television, specifically the "Legal Channel", is now broadcasting programs on traditional ethics and morals. This is unprecedented anywhere else in the world, where a national television station leads the way in promoting the teachings of the sages. "When a country is about to prosper, there will be auspicious signs."  The venerable elder has said that there are two types of people who can save the world: first, national leaders, and second, media heads.  Currently, China’s President Xi is taking the lead and instructing the media to promote these sacred teachings.  Therefore, as people of the past have said, the 21st century is the century of the Chinese, and necessarily must be the century of the Chinese, because only the teachings of Chinese culture – Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism - can lead the world towards stable and happy families and lives. This is not just my own opinion; Professor Toynbee said in the 1970s, “The only way to solve the social problems of the 21st century is through the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, along with Mahayana Buddhism,” which encompasses the teachings of Chinese culture.

Of course, with “education coming first,” what should we teach?  We must teach ethics and morality so that people will be ashamed to do evil. We must teach the law of cause and effect so that people will not dare to do evil. The most important teachings of ethics and morality include the Five Relationships and the Eight Virtues.  And in truth, the law of cause and effect is present everywhere. Everything is an education in cause and effect. Today, if a student achieves high grades, it’s an effect.  The causes are their hard work, their focused attention in class, and that they are not reading other books during class; hence, they reap great rewards.  There is a reason for everything. Respecting teachers is also a cause.  Every line of the *Disciple's Regulations* embodies cause and effect. Why? “When parents call, answer without delay,” is the cause. In the future, the effect will be that the child listens to their teachers at school and listens to their leaders at work. “When praised, feel apprehension. When criticized, be joyful” is the cause. “Upright friends will draw near” is the effect.  Is there anything that is not subject to cause and effect?  If we calmly observe our friends and relatives, we will see that “a family that accumulates goodness” is the cause and “will surely have an abundance of blessings” is the effect. The long lineage of the families of Confucius and Fan Gong is the effect; the cause is that they accumulated great virtue and lived with great integrity.  In fact, throughout history, the entirety of the *Twenty-Five Histories*, all of Chinese history, is a history of cause and effect.  Many wise and virtuous people who have been recorded throughout history had descendants who thrived.  For example, Bao Shuya recommended Guan Zhong, and their families are recorded throughout history as high-ranking officials for over a dozen generations. Their descendants had great blessings.

I recently visited Changzhou in Jiangsu province, where a business owner is in the business of water purification.  I saw that he truly enjoyed his work. Every time he purifies contaminated water, he would be as happy as a child, exclaiming, “Ah, fantastic! People can now drink good water.”  He is also very knowledgeable about the *I Ching*.  Coincidentally, he was invited to Malaysia to guide a water purification project.  Before leaving, he did a divination, he is surnamed Li, and according to the divination, it was unlikely he would succeed in this Malaysian business venture. However, a thought came to him. He said, “Even if I don’t succeed in this business deal, I should still bring China’s top water purification technology to Malaysia for the benefit of the Chinese people and all the people here.”  With that thought, he went ahead.  In the end, the deal went through, and he signed the contract.

Originally, it was unlikely to succeed, but how did it happen? Do you all see how destiny is changed? It’s all about the magnitude of one’s heart and mind. The power of his intention was great. He was concerned for the health of an entire country. This one thought changed the course of events.  That’s why many national leaders seek guidance from my teacher when they are running for elections, concerned about whether they will win. My teacher tells them that as long as they are determined to serve the people as if they were their children, to promote the teachings of the sages, they will be elected, even if it seemed impossible before. Therefore, to change destiny, one must make great vows to benefit all living beings. My teacher has told me that many Taiwanese officials have sought his advice and he has always encouraged them with this same principle.

I immediately thought of this Mr. Li, whose story proves that when people make vows, they can change the course of events. When I went to visit him at his home in Changzhou, they welcomed me with great enthusiasm. Because he is knowledgeable about the *I Ching*, I jokingly told him that we should also do a divination for the meal we were sharing.  He was sitting to my right, and another general manager, surnamed Liu, was sitting to my left.  I said that the divination was very auspicious because it represented the Han and Tang dynasties. The Han dynasty was ruled by the Liu family, and the Tang dynasty was ruled by the Li family. Therefore, this divination foretold that traditional culture would be revitalized from Changzhou. They all sat up straight and took pride in their responsibility.

As the saying goes, “Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles,” but we must also interact with countless people, make many friends, and learn the precious virtues of how to be a good person.  Therefore, to achieve the principle of “education coming first,” leaders must take the lead. Now, the Chinese people must take the lead.

The fifth important point is to discuss the revitalization of the teacher’s path; that is, the respect due to teachers.  This is the fifth key focus. How can the path of teachers be revitalized and gain the respect it deserves? It must be restored, because the two most important pillars of Chinese culture are filial piety and the path of the teacher.  Ancestral temples and shrines teach filial piety, so that people will “remember their ancestors with reverence and the people’s virtues will become noble.”  Shrines teach ethics and filial piety; the Confucius Temple teaches morality and ethics; and the City God Temples teach the law of cause and effect.  These represent the wisdom of our ancestors in their approach to education.  Now, the City God Temples no longer exist, and ancestral shrines have been reduced to small family units. Therefore, it is rare and precious that many places are now building clan shrines and shrines to honor all family names.

How can the path of teachers be revitalized? Without it, people will not respect their teachers, and how can they possibly benefit from learning?  This is because, "With one portion of sincerity and respect, one gains one portion of benefit. With ten portions of sincerity and respect, one gains ten portions of benefit."  Our beloved teacher emphasizes that these two words are the key. Thus, he added: “With one hundred portions of sincerity and respect, one gains one hundred portions of benefit. With one thousand portions of sincerity and respect, one gains one thousand portions of benefit. With ten thousand portions of sincerity and respect, one gains ten thousand portions of benefit.”  He even used the example of a well-known historical figure, the Sixth Patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Master Huineng, from the Tang Dynasty. He listened to his teacher’s teachings for only two or three hours and was enlightened after hearing the explanation of half of the *Diamond Sutra.* What was the basis? Enlightenment was the result; the basis was his ten thousand portions of sincerity and respect, and this is how much benefit he received. At the time, he was only 24 years old. Therefore, people do not need to be elderly to possess great wisdom; the foundation is determined by a sincere and respectful heart.

Students must respect their teachers to truly benefit, highlighting the importance of the teacher's role. But teachers must also respect themselves in order to earn respect. If teachers don't respect their divine mission and shirk their responsibilities, how can they possibly earn the trust of parents, families, students, and society? Recent news reports have caused us great concern and pain, revealing some bad apples in the education system who have engaged in misconduct that has harmed students. It made me think of the phrase, "When virtue is damaged, it shames one's parents." Their damaged virtue brings shame not only to them and their families, but also pulls down the entire education system. Therefore, their negative karma is extremely heavy. Even more serious is that if parents and students do not trust their teachers, they will not be able to learn anything.

As I mentioned before, there are no bad people in this world, only people to be pitied. Those educators who have made mistakes have created tremendous negative karma. They once had a mission when they entered the field of education, but without the guidance of the classics and sages, they became consumed by greed and desires, and so they committed these offenses. “No one is a sage or a saint; who can be without mistakes? But to recognize one's mistakes and change is the greatest good.” Therefore, the most important thing now is to help them return to the right path. The fact that these events occurred emphasizes the need for education. People who don't learn don't know. They don’t understand what is right.

Therefore, our fifth principle for discussion is the respect for the path of the teacher.  The first step is that we must respect ourselves and understand the importance of the teacher’s role. We can understand the importance of teachers from the classics. In the “Teaching and Transforming” section of *Essentials of Governance from the Classics*, which includes 218 sentences spread over 130 pages, let us revisit the following passage: “Without understanding ritual and righteousness, the law cannot be enforced. Laws can execute the unfilial, but they cannot make people follow the example of Confucius and Zengzi; laws can punish thieves, but they cannot make people as virtuous as Boyi and Shuqi. Confucius raised three thousand disciples, who all practiced filial piety and fraternal respect, and their words became literature and their conduct an example for others. All of this was achieved through teaching.”

Next, I will cite a few teachings from the classics to illuminate the importance of teachers. This is the first quote. As it says, if people don't understand ritual and righteousness, the laws of the country cannot be implemented. Even if they are implemented, social order will not necessarily improve. If we think about it, are the places with high crime rates also the places where laws are the weakest? Take the United States for example. The United States is ranked among the highest in terms of the completeness and sophistication of its legal system, yet it has a high crime rate. If we do not teach and transform, the law can only address the symptoms and not the root of the problem. Without addressing the root cause, problems will only continue to arise. Therefore, Laozi reminds us that, “Where laws and regulations increase, there will be many thieves and robbers.” In places where the laws are strict, there are still many criminals.

The passage goes on to explain that the law can execute the unfilial, but it cannot make people emulate the filial conduct and integrity of Confucius and Zengzi. The law can punish thieves, but it cannot instill in people the incorruptible virtue of Boyi and Shuqi. This clearly shows that the fundamental solution lies in education and transformation.  It cites the best example: “Confucius raised three thousand disciples,” and each and every one of them embodied “filial piety and fraternal respect,” meaning that at home they were devoted to their parents and outside the home, they respected their elders. “Their words became literature,” meaning their words became the standard by which people lived their lives. “Their conduct an example for others,” meaning their conduct became a model for the masses. Three thousand disciples, each one of them influenced and transformed the people in their own areas. “All of this was achieved through teaching.”  Those of us currently engaged in education must remember that because the masses lack an education in traditional culture, we must all strive to become modern-day Confucius.

Let’s look back at history. The Sixth Patriarch, Master Huineng, taught 43 students, who then carried on the legacy of Zen Buddhism throughout China.  43 students! Now Chinese culture, which includes not only Buddhism, not just one sect, is what? It’s that Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism are all facing a critical moment in their survival. This lineage is about to be broken.  Let’s do the math.  How many people are needed to carry on this legacy? How much should we multiply 43 by? Multiplying by 100 is not excessive, right? Multiplying by 1000 is also not excessive, right? No matter how many people there are, who is definitely included? I can see that everyone here is glowing with the light of their vows.  When a vow is made, Heaven and Earth respond. "Even if the body encounters hardship, this vow will never retreat."  "Nothing is impossible to a willing heart." This is the first passage.

The second passage, from the *Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites*, tells us: “If jade is not cut and polished, it cannot become an object of use; if a person does not learn, they will not know the Way. Therefore, the ancient rulers always made education their priority when building their nations and governing their people. The *Instructions of Yue* states: 'From beginning to end, always focus on learning.' Is it not exactly what we are saying here?”

The ancient rulers always considered education to be the most important, from beginning to end. The prime minister could not take charge, so the minister of rites (the education minister) would take charge.  All the other departments were there to serve the department of education.  "If a person does not learn, they will not know the Way." The ancients, through these words, taught us educators what we need to learn: to use comparisons, analogies, and to tell stories. “If jade is not cut and polished,” using jade as a specific analogy, “it cannot become an object of use." Therefore, people also need to be cultivated and refined to become accomplished. This tells us that everyone needs the education of the sages and the guidance of teachers. No one in this world can teach themselves. It is through the instruction of virtuous teachers that we achieve our highest potential. This quote also reminds us of the importance of teachers, and their role as the ones who give people wisdom. Parents give us our physical lives, but teachers and educators give us our wisdom lives.

Next, the text from the *Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites* specifically addresses the importance of the teacher, again using analogies: “The ancient scholars made comparisons and analogies, categorized things, and understood principles. If the drum is not part of the five tones, the five tones cannot be harmonious; if water is not part of the five colors, the five colors cannot be made vivid; if learning is not related to the five officials, the five officials cannot govern well; if the teacher is not related to the five degrees of mourning, the five relationships cannot be close.”

Ancient scholars were very skilled at analyzing and comparing things. They could use comparisons to illuminate principles. For example, with the drum. The sound of the drum, “not part,” is not considered part of the five musical tones: Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu.  However, without the drum, the five tones cannot be played in harmony.  Therefore, the sound of the drum is important. “If water is not part of the five colors,” meaning that water does not belong to the five basic colors of green, yellow, red, black, and white.  However, when painting, without water to dilute them, the colors cannot be made bright, vivid, and expressive. A scholar is not considered one of the “five officials." One meaning of "the five officials" are the five important positions: Situ, Sikong, Sima, Sishi, and Sikou. “The five officials cannot govern well,” without learning, these officials cannot carry out their responsibilities effectively and serve their country. It’s connected to the “Governance” section we just learned from *Essentials of Governance from the Classics*, especially chapter nine, “Emulating the Ancient.” “Emulating the Ancient,” the first teaching, states that one should learn from the past, because “Learning from the past makes you fit to govern.” Furthermore, “Deliberating based on the system” is also important. That is, one should make decisions by deliberating based on ancient systems. In this way, “Governance will not be misguided.” All these precious historical systems and experiences must be passed down. Therefore, “if learning is not related to the five officials, the five officials cannot govern well.”

“If the teacher is not related to the five degrees of mourning, the five relationships cannot be close.”  A teacher is not considered to be part of the five degrees of mourning. “Five degrees of mourning” refers to the five categories of family relationships, based on the degree of closeness. This is indicated by the clothing worn during mourning. The first level is known as Zhan Cui, which indicates three years of mourning for one’s parents; the second level is known as Qi Cui, which indicates one year of mourning for one’s grandparents; and there is also Da Gong, Xiao Gong, and Zi Ma.  Da Gong is nine months, Xiao Gong is five months, and Zi Ma is three months. It refers to these five different degrees of family relationships.  Although a teacher is not included in these relationships, without a teacher’s guidance, these family members will not be able to love each other so closely.  Therefore, parents teach their children to respect teachers, and teachers teach their students to be filial to their parents. These are the most important principles.

From these analogies, we can appreciate that without the guidance of teachers, people do not understand the Five Relationships. They don’t know how to be filial to parents or how to love their family members, and conflicts will inevitably arise.  Although a teacher is not part of these relationships, our Chinese culture emphasizes the substance rather than the form. Therefore, when our teacher passes away, we mourn in our hearts for three years. Although there is no formal ritual, we still mourn for three years, because as the old saying goes, “One day as a teacher, a lifetime as a father.” This is the third passage.

The fourth passage is the saying of the great Han Dynasty scholar Yang Xiong: “Oh teacher, oh teacher, the life of a child depends on you.” Whether or not a child can develop the foundation of ethics and morality has an impact on the rest of their lives.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability while keeping in mind the tone of a lecture or discussion:

**Translation:**

Therefore, the concept of “engineers of the human soul” was already emphasized by Confucian scholars in the Han Dynasty. Because when children go to school, their speech gradually shifts from “my dad says, my mom says” to “our teacher says,” indicating that teachers hold a very esteemed position in their hearts. We must cherish this trust that children place in us and value this connection we share with them.

Fifth, instead of citing classic scriptures, let’s look to the contemporary sages around us, like the esteemed Mr. Sim Mow Yu of Malacca. Mr. Sim left us with an aspiration that teachers are crucial custodians of cultural heritage; that cultural transmission relies on teachers. I remember the brief meeting I had with Mr. Sim. That short interaction left a profound impact on my life. He first invited us to sing an anti-Japanese patriotic song, which he accompanied on the harmonium. The patriotic fervor with which we sang together left an indelible impression. Then, Mr. Sim said, "Being a teacher is not a profession for financial gain, but it is the most important profession because cultural transmission depends on teachers."

A Chinese writer in Hong Kong wrote an article saying that the Chinese possess the world's oldest culture, but because it hasn't been passed down, they have become the most shortsighted people, so shortsighted that they would harm their own parents for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars. When I saw this, my deepest feeling was that if culture is not passed on, the soul of the entire nation will rapidly decline. Later, hearing Mr. Sim’s words, I was deeply moved and will never forget them! Then in 2002, I met my elder, Uncle Lu. Uncle Lu deeply cared for us. Truly, seeing our willingness to learn traditional culture, he treated us as his own children, showing us immense love. Because these elders deeply understood the importance of cultural transmission, they prioritized nurturing talent for the country and the nation even more than their own children. Their breadth of vision truly inspired our admiration and respect. These are the five points I wanted to share with everyone today.

Moving on to the second key point: Respecting teachers enables one to value the Dao (the Way) and to respect morality and knowledge. The first classic passage I'll share with you comes from the *Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites*: “The principle of all learning is that having a strict teacher is difficult. Only when the teacher is strict will the Dao be respected, and only when the Dao is respected will people understand and value learning.” This is something readily apparent from these classic words. In ancient times, there were only two types of ministers with whom the emperor did not interact with the etiquette of lord and subject. First, it was when a minister looked exactly like his ancestors. During ancestral worship ceremonies, this person was invited to participate and was not treated as a subject. Why? Because next time he was in that position, it would be difficult to show him respect. Thus, he was not treated as a subject because he would later represent the ancestors for whom we would show our respects. The second group was one's own teacher. They were treated with the etiquette of host and guest, with the host taking the east seat, and the guest the west seat. Thus, teachers were called “Western Seat,” showing respect for the teacher's position.

Okay, let's pause this lesson here today. Thank you everyone!

**Translator's Notes:**

*   **"人類靈魂的工程師 (Rénlèi línghún de gōngchéngshī)"**: This phrase is a well-known and evocative Chinese term for teachers, literally translated as "engineers of the human soul." I've kept it as "engineers of the human soul" because it's a meaningful concept in this context.
*   **"漢朝大儒 (Hàncháo dàrú)"**: Refers to great Confucian scholars of the Han dynasty.
*   **"沈慕羽老先生 (Shěn Mùyǔ lǎoxiānshēng)"**:  I've kept the full name, "Mr. Sim Mow Yu" with the respectful honorifics, as it adds to the sense of reverence.
*   **"道 (Dào)"**: I translated it as “the Dao (the Way)” as it reflects its deeper philosophical meaning in this context.
*   **《禮記‧學記》(Lǐjì Xuéjì)**: Translated as "*Record of Learning* in the *Book of Rites*" for clarity.
*   **"西席 (xīxí)"**: I maintained the explanation about the "Western Seat" to fully preserve the meaning and cultural nuances.

Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a tone that reflects the original speaker's sincerity and reverence:

**Lecture 8: The Dignity of the Teaching Profession: 2. Respecting Teachers Enables the Flourishing of the Way; 3. Revitalizing the Teaching Profession**

Respected elders, colleagues in the field of education, and fellow students, good afternoon!

We are sharing with you today about the “dignity of the teaching profession.” First, we will reflect upon the importance of teachers from the classics. The second key point is that respecting teachers enables the flourishing of the Way (道). We cited a passage from the *Book of Rites – Record of Learning*, which says, “In the path of learning, a strict teacher is difficult to find.” Respecting a teacher is the most difficult, but also the most crucial and fundamental thing. “When the teacher is respected, then the Way will be honored.” When teachers are respected, moral learning, true knowledge, and principles will be honored. “When the Way is honored, then the people know to respect learning.” When moral learning, true knowledge, and principles are honored, then the people will diligently and respectfully engage in learning.

We just spoke about how ancient emperors understood the importance of respecting teachers. They treated their teachers with the courtesy of a host to a guest, which aligns perfectly with what is mentioned in the *Essential Writings for Governing the People*. If we open to page 156 of *Essential Writings for Governing the People 360*, our *Essential Writings 360* course is scheduled to cover, in sequence, exactly this passage today, sentence 259. Isn't that remarkable? How can it be so precise! Out of the many sentences in *Essential Writings 360*, it's this sentence that discusses the importance of the teaching profession, and it happens to be the very sentence we are scheduled to discuss today. It is as if the sages and ancestors are watching over us, the Chinese people of Malaysia and the Chinese people of China. See how harmoniously our circumstances align as we are all learning about the teaching profession from the classics, hoping to revitalize it.

“Therefore, no ancient sage kings failed to respect their teachers. When teachers are respected, distinctions of status, wealth, and poverty are disregarded.” This is the second important passage for our discussion on “respecting teachers enables the flourishing of the Way.” The first passage was from the *Book of Rites – Record of Learning,* and this second one comes from *Essential Writings for Governing the People – Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*. Let’s calmly think: what is the connection between governing and respecting teachers? Governing is about managing the affairs of the people and ensuring a well-run country. If everyone respects teachers, understands the fundamental principles of human relations, and knows their responsibilities, then families will be stable. As we just discussed, “Teachers are not within the five mourning grades, yet those within the five mourning grades must not be distanced." All familial relationships require the guidance of teachers to learn about ethics and morality, allowing people to love one another. Therefore, sage kings understood the importance of the teaching profession, and they greatly respected teachers, including inviting teachers to instruct their crown princes and their children, where the students would perform the proper ceremony of becoming a disciple. Moreover, respecting teachers meant disregarding their social status, wealth, and poverty. “Where the Way is found, there the teacher is found.” "One may hear the Way earlier than another, and each has their own expertise." If someone's knowledge and capabilities in a particular area surpass our own, we should humbly learn from them.

When Mr. Han Yu wrote his essay "On Teachers," perhaps the social climate at the time was such that people were overly concerned with saving face and were unwilling to learn humbly from others. Frankly speaking, how many opportunities to elevate our morality and capabilities do we miss because of concern with face? This is foolishness, a lack of self-love. Holding on to bad habits actually hinders our own progress. Therefore, we must not “recognize the thief as one’s father;” saving face is driven by greed. We must let go of these bad habits. As the saying goes, “Arrogance invites loss, humility brings benefit.”  *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* states, “With humility, there is a foundation for learning, and there is no limit to the good one can acquire.” If a person is truly humble and learns from everyone's strengths, it would be extraordinary. Every day their "virtue will improve and faults will decrease," just like the *Standards for Students* says, “When you see the good in others, think to emulate them.” With respect, we admire the virtues of others and proceed to learn from them. We meet many people each day; if we started learning from the strengths of each person, becoming a sage or worthy person would not be difficult.

Therefore, the *Standards for Students* states one practical sentence, and if we implement it, our moral learning would improve significantly. If we've studied for half a year, a year, or two or three years and don't see much progress, it's because we have not truly implemented every phrase in the classics. Thus, learning must return to the practice of implementing each phrase thoroughly. Only then is it true learning. Otherwise, it's merely acquiring knowledge, which does not benefit our body, mind, or life, and may even foster superficiality.  *Standards for Students* says it very clearly, “If one does not strive to practice,” and merely learns knowledge, “one increases shallowness.” Because one does not demand improvement from oneself, it turns into criticizing others, which breeds arrogance. Every phrase in the *Standards for Students* is crucial to cultivating our character. We must not neglect this foundation. A deep and solid root is necessary for abundant foliage.

Let's move on to the third key point regarding “respecting teachers enables the flourishing of the Way.” There's a saying, "There are top-scoring students, but not top-scoring teachers.” What does this saying tell us? It is because the student’s attitude towards learning is more respectful than the teacher's attitude. Therefore, the student surpasses the teacher. While the teacher can lecture, they may not fully implement all they teach; they are also working hard. However, the student accepts what the teacher says with utmost respect, without focusing on the teacher’s shortcomings, maintaining that same level of respect, even increasing it, cherishing and appreciating it even more. Why? Because what the teacher is teaching is correct knowledge and views. The student is able to cherish the karmic connection to the Dharma; therefore, they are able to outshine the teacher. So this point highlights that top-scoring students excel because they are more honest, obedient, and genuinely committed to practice than their teachers.

Fourthly, we want to emphasize a very important point: “Filial piety is the foundation for respecting teachers.” For those of us involved in education, it’s crucial to deeply understand this truth. We all want our children to truly benefit, and that begins with them respecting their teachers. The student’s respect for their teachers is rooted in filial piety. The *Classic of Filial Piety* tells us, "To respect others but not one’s parents is called a violation of propriety.” This does not follow natural human behavior patterns. One must first respect their parents, who have provided them with the greatest kindness, and then that respect will naturally extend to teachers and elders. So, when teachers recognize this key point—if a student lacks the root of filial piety, how can we possibly expect them to respect teachers? It simply won't happen.

The most important task for teachers is to transmit the Way and knowledge. Among these, the most important is to teach students about filial piety. If we fail to teach students about filial piety, then we have failed in our duties as educators; this is the truth. As Confucius tells us, “Filial piety is the root of virtue and that from which all teachings arise.” Education begins here. If we do not teach filial piety, education has not even begun. What is the meaning of “*yu* (育, to educate)” in education (*jiao yu* 教育)? It means “to nurture children to do good.” "Of all virtues, filial piety is the foundation." If you don't teach filial piety, all other virtues cannot be cultivated. It cannot be considered education; it is merely knowledge transfer, not true education.

So, for the benefit of our students, even though parents and students may not necessarily understand respecting teachers, we must first teach students filial piety. Once students learn this, they will start thinking about their parents, wanting to respect them. Many children, being very innocent, will go home, stand at their parents' door, and when their parents come out, they will bow at ninety degrees, saying, "Good morning, Mom and Dad!" The parents would be taken by complete surprise. Just think: would such parents be happy? Of course they would, and that would naturally lead them to respect the teacher as well.

When people fulfill their duty, respect will come naturally. If they do not fulfill their duty, they will not earn respect, no matter how hard they try. For example, in a marriage, if the husband demands this from the wife, and the wife demands that from the husband, and they are constantly arguing, if one person acts rationally and does their part, they will move the other. If you fulfill your duty, and they respond in kind, both return to fulfilling their duty. Therefore, each person being in their proper place is very important, especially in this era. Whether others are doing the right thing or not is not the most important thing. The first thing is that we must do the right thing, especially for those of us who have already learned these principles. If we do not act righteously, then we bear more blame. I’m not making this up; don't look to me for this. Why? Because knowingly doing wrong is more blameworthy. As *Standards for Students* says, “If one covers up their mistakes, the fault is doubled.” The *Standards for Students* says so, not me. I have already congratulated everyone, congratulations! We have no choice but to move forward and shoulder this responsibility.

When we truly understand these principles, we will act with great peace of mind, happiness, and stability. In our short lives, we should fulfill our responsibilities and leave a positive influence in this world. By fulfilling our roles as teachers, members of families, we can set examples for future generations.

Fifthly, let us reflect upon the current family and social situation, where the respect for teachers is indeed lacking. Let’s compare the past to the present. First, the ceremony of becoming a disciple. In ancient times, one would first bow down to Confucius, with three prostrations and nine kowtows. Then, the father would bring the child to the private tutor, and together they would perform three prostrations and nine kowtows.  Many people today may not understand the significance of this, some might even say, “Why would we give teachers three prostrations and nine kowtows? What era is this? We are living in an era of equality; students are equal to their teachers.” This may sound logical, but they fail to understand who benefits the most from this ceremony – and those benefits are lifelong.

From our perspective, we cannot fathom the profound wisdom of our ancestors' understanding of human nature.  By criticizing without understanding, people take on serious karmic responsibility. In this ceremony of becoming a disciple, the person who commands the most respect from the child is their own father. If the father performs such a great ceremony towards the teacher, would the child dare to disobey the teacher? The child’s respect for the teacher is absolute; there is no joking or taking things lightly. “When the teacher is respected, then the Way will be honored. When the Way is honored, then the people know to respect learning.” The root of the child's respect for the teacher is deeply planted in this ritual. We have heard from some elder teachers that their few months of receiving private instruction in their childhood, as well as their moral instruction, have impacted them their entire lives. Even in the midst of a society filled with so many temptations, they are able to remain virtuous because of the foundation laid by their traditional private schooling. These elders deeply understand the wisdom of our ancestors' traditions. The ceremony of becoming a disciple is one such tradition. Other such traditions, such as the teachings during wedding ceremonies, are also clearly examples of highly educational art and wisdom. And the children benefit from them.

Some might say, "The teacher just sits there, receiving bows from others. They're acting superior." This is just someone's own biased thought. Let's consider: people who have studied the wisdom of the sages are unwilling to take advantage of anyone else, let alone sit there and be bowed down to! What might be their feelings? We haven't been in that position, but imagining it, it feels like sitting on pins and needles. The child's father is also an adult. They are all mutually respectful to one another. How can one bear to accept such great respect? But it is for whom? For the sake of the child, for the sake of those who transmit the Way, for the sake of future generations! Even if it feels like sitting on pins and needles, they must endure it! And if they do not teach the child well after the bowing ceremony, how can they face the child’s parents and family? Therefore, we must carefully consider the profound and far-reaching educational wisdom behind the traditions of our ancestors. If we do not reflect upon them, we may easily misinterpret them, and thereby throw the educational wisdom of five thousand years into the trash.

And now, teachers are no longer treated with such respect.  If children experience some dissatisfaction or unhappiness at school, they will rush to the school, and without clarifying the situation, immediately question the teacher.  How can teachers still dare to educate students under such conditions?  Especially given this contrast between the past and present, parents must carefully reflect. This is truly for the good of our children.

Furthermore, our principals and heads of kindergartens must recognize the importance of this because teachers cannot advocate for themselves. People will become displeased. But principals and heads of kindergartens must consider the needs of the teachers, understand their difficulties, and remind parents of their attitude, “With dozens of students in a class, the teachers work so hard and have invested so much effort into your child.” Gradually, parents might calm down, which makes it easier to address the issue. If a principal cannot understand the teachers' needs and instead blames the teachers, then the teacher's heart will feel cold and disheartened!  Especially since the principal is the leader of the teachers. Leaders should be the support for their subordinates. This is the mark of a leader with vision. Even if the teacher is truly at fault, if you calm the parents down, the teacher can reflect, thinking, “I was a bit careless and even caused my principal trouble.” They will admire you even more, and the cohesiveness of our entire school will be enhanced.

Frankly speaking, education requires cooperation. To educate a child well, to nurture future generations well, grandparents, aunts, uncles, parents all must be in cooperation. If they do not understand the principles of education, and instead contradict one another, then the process of educating becomes exhausting. The same is true for the school. Everyone must work together.  If a child is misbehaving, has a special circumstance, the principal calls them in to explain the good intentions of the teacher. When parents come in, they must also be mindful of the teachers' hard work. Everyone's cooperation ensures that education is successful.  We must be considerate of one another.

Mutual accusations will eventually discourage those who are dedicated and devoted. They will think, “Maybe I should leave.”  I have heard many dedicated teachers say, “I can hardly continue teaching.”  We must quickly encourage them because these good teachers are so rare and valuable. If the education field continues to lose these teachers, it will be catastrophic for the next generation. Therefore, when you encounter a good teacher who is disheartened, quickly encourage them. Invite them to go eat, have some healthy vegetarian food, listen to some beautiful music and relax. Then you can share with them the *Record of Learning* from the *Book of Rites* and share with them this point about how important it is to respect teachers. With the present karmic circumstances, we must do our best to help them through it. This is the path to completion.

A second observation contrasting the past and present is that when people hosted celebratory banquets, such as wedding banquets, countless people from the community and extended family would gather together.  And the honored seat at the head table was given to the local teacher. Please think: who sits at the head table these days? The one who has earned the most money, or the one who holds the highest position in government. Let's calmly think about this: the teacher may not be rich and may not hold high social status, but by seating them in the most honored position, what does this signify? It signifies respect for morality and respect for teachers. Moreover, a teacher in this position represents the children of that community who may be educated by them. If a wealthy family establishes a private school, many neighbors who are unable to afford a tutor will be able to study there. We shouldn't underestimate this single action: the children of the community benefit. When children attend celebratory banquets and see their teacher seated at the head table, their respect naturally grows. Nowadays, the wealthy occupy the head table; everyone admires wealth and wants to earn more money, not valuing morality.

To be honest, I had never seen this kind of practice, but I heard a story that deeply moved me. One of our colleagues spoke of his grandmother. On Chinese New Year’s Eve, she would make dumplings, which symbolize gold coins. Once the first plate was cooked, she would tell him to take it to the ancestral hall to honor the ancestors with the utmost respect. As a five- or six-year-old, he was given this important task and carefully carried the dumplings. The attitude of respecting ancestors was rooted in this simple act. Then the second plate would be ready, and to be honest, 30-40 years ago, the only times one could eat dumplings were during the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. Did they want to eat them? Very much, but they had to swallow the saliva. Then the second plate of dumplings had to be taken for “*xiansheng jia*” (闽南语：先生呷, Minnan Chinese dialect: "for the teacher to eat"), meaning for the teacher. The child’s filial piety, respect for ancestors, and respect for teachers were cultivated simply through the act of carrying dumplings and through daily living. When I heard this story, I thought that this elder was more knowledgeable about living life than even the most well-educated university students.

When I first went to mainland China, what I was most unaccustomed to was how many elderly people understood profound principles. When they spoke, they would say, “Oh, I am uncultured.” Yet, I thought that they were the most cultured people! What they really meant was that they didn’t have an education. However, many university graduates who do not understand filial piety have a high education but do not have true culture. Why? These elderly people inspire and influence so many people. How can we say they do not have culture? We go to university and become arrogant, and do not inspire anyone at all. How can we be considered cultured? Thus, in the teachings of the sages, substance is valued more than form.

So this contrast invites our reflection. If you have a daughter and she gets married, “start with me.” Revive filial piety and respect for teachers, start with me. Use traditional wedding ceremonies and invite the most virtuous and knowledgeable person in your community to take the honored seat. This would have great significance. Then, as a blessing to the newlywed couple, you can invite this elder to the stage. How wonderful! Everyone will benefit from this. This wedding ceremony would accumulate boundless merit. You can also take the opportunity to distribute the "The World's Parents" DVD, or some traditional cultural lectures to everyone. Those are opportune moments, because after watching the traditional wedding, it conveys morality, righteousness, and gratitude, which will move everyone, and when they are moved, they will want to learn.  Don’t think that because they are moved, you can wait until later. Because the karmic opportunity will be missed.

Thirdly, let’s talk about disciplining students. The greatest obstacle we have now is our ego. When our parents discipline us, we complain, "Ugh, why did they hit me so hard?" We do not know that a parent’s heart is hurting when they strike their child. First, when we make mistakes, our parents feel even more pained than we do. Secondly, they have to beat us to help us remember, which causes them further pain, yet we still do not understand. So I feel that the young people these days really do not understand filial piety. They are truly hurting their parents' feelings. Then we go to school, and may hurt our teachers’ feelings. If the teacher criticizes us a few times, we will hold onto it for several days and be unable to let go.

Actually, let's think about this: what teacher enjoys scolding students? What is the point of scolding? No teacher would come to a classroom to randomly scold and create bad karma unless they were not in their right mind.  It's difficult to be a teacher in our era. I once heard Uncle Lu speak about how difficult it was to be a teacher. I truly admire his work. He devoted himself to his students for more than ten, even twenty years, considering their well-being as well as the well-being of their entire families. But the students don’t realize his efforts, let alone show any gratitude. He once watched a Korean drama that discussed teachers, and one of the lines was, "Even dogs won't eat a teacher's excrement." Why wouldn't a dog eat a teacher's excrement? It's too bitter! Dogs may not be able to change their habit of eating feces, but why would they not eat a teacher’s? It’s too bitter and hard to swallow.

So I remember listening to elders share, nowadays, there is no student-teacher relationship; even a friendship would be lucky. You can’t even say anything without creating resentment. Oh well, today we are all one family, let me vent a little. When I first came to Malaysia, our center had Chinese people from mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Hawaii. We all come from different family and social backgrounds, and we have different ways of thinking. So when I give a lecture, some people from certain regions will say, “Oh, good scolding! Very beneficial,” while others feel like their hearts are bleeding, “The teacher is so fierce!”  I once felt a little mentally unstable; I didn’t know how to balance it. I had to be very careful about whether I’d be hurting someone in this group or hurting someone in that group. I had to consider the needs of everyone. Because my virtue and cultivation were not sufficient, I would sometimes unknowingly hurt others’ feelings. So recently I often say, “I did not intend to kill someone, but they died because of me.” This is why it is so important to understand the parents’ feelings.

Moreover, we must try to understand the good intentions of others.  To truly understand the good intentions of others, we must let go of our own thoughts and feelings, otherwise we cannot understand our parents or others. If we cannot understand our parents and others, especially in a group, if we cannot understand our leaders, in a school, if we cannot understand our teachers, then it is difficult for us to grow to be sensible and mature. A person's moral foundation, and their maturity, are inseparable from respecting parents and teachers. These are the very root of how to be a person. Therefore, we must truly be able to understand the good intentions of our teachers, sages, and ancestors.

I have this karmic opportunity to cherish with you the teachings of our ancestors, cherish the teachings of our teachers, and cherish the teachings of our sages. I am only your classmate, truly learning with all of you. What good intentions of my teachers that I can understand, I will share with you. What good intentions of Confucius that I can understand, I will share with you. And you are all truly my teachers. Like yesterday during our study group, the students shared their heartfelt gratitude and self-reflection. When a person’s true feelings are revealed, it is truly moving. When they shed tears, I shed tears with them.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and sensitivity to the original tone:

**The Power of Sincere Hearts**

The energy and magnetism of a truly sincere heart are incredibly powerful.  It can actually make you see your own flaws, prompting you to confess to classmates, even feeling the need to kneel and apologize because you realize the weight of the harm your words caused. I was deeply moved by him, by them all. Someone reflecting on themselves, saying, “I am so ashamed. I did not love my family or classmates with the heart of a family member, with the heart of an elder brother.” And a grown man was shedding tears.

Later, after the course ended, I was discussing some things with Teacher Li, and we got back to talking about those moments when the older students’ sincerity was revealed. As I spoke about it, my eyes welled up again. But we’ve trained ourselves – we can only let the tears gather in our eyes, they absolutely can't fall, or we'll lose technical points. I’m sharing this with everyone now, and my eyes are still a bit watery. So I'm extremely grateful to these older students. Their sincerity was a purification for my life and my studies, and I truly thank them from the bottom of my heart.

This brings to mind the third point, when teachers would say that back then, if a child was disciplined at school, nothing could be hidden from their parents. Either the child would confess, or the parents would notice something off in their eyes and ask about it. Once they found out that their child had been disciplined at school, the next day they would bring a gift to thank the teacher. This was eighty years ago. Honorable elders, respected senior classmates, if your grandchildren or children are disciplined at school and you bring gifts to the teacher the next day, there would be a headline, the hottest news, probably in the newspapers, starting a trend. Think about it, when the teachers see the parents' attitude, it will move them even more, making them feel compelled to teach diligently. So, these gifts have a profound impact on the children and the educators. Nowadays, when a child is disciplined, the parents sue the teacher, go to court. How can a teacher dare to teach anymore?

The fourth point: there’s the traditional saying, "Teachers and students are like father and son." The relationship between them is one of righteousness and gratitude. Nowadays, when students meet teachers on the street, they don't even say hello. Why? Because it's no longer a relationship built on righteousness. If teachers don't teach children ethics and morality, and just focus on knowledge, the children become utilitarian, thinking, "I just need to do well on exams." And then? They only see degrees and diplomas. Once they leave the school, they feel no gratitude for the headmaster or teachers. So, a school that emphasizes moral and ethical education ensures that its students will genuinely respect the headmaster and the teachers. I have witnessed this myself. I once visited Songhua River Middle School in Jilin, and the parents and students there had immense respect for the principal. This respect was naturally earned because the principal and teachers were devoted to securing the happiness of the students' lives. Principal Lu has always emphasized “promoting the ‘Standards for Being a Good Student,’ promoting Chinese culture, and laying the foundation for a lifetime of happiness for the children.” This is his philosophy. Through this comparison, we don’t make demands on the students; we make demands on ourselves. Do we cultivate a relationship of righteousness with students, one that helps them achieve lifelong success?

Now, the fifth phenomenon, a current trend: schools are becoming businesses, and businesses are becoming schools. When I heard about this, I felt it was the greatest shame for our education system, and that shame was brought on by ourselves, not by others. Mencius wisely reminded us, “People must insult themselves before others insult them; families must ruin themselves before others ruin them; countries must invade themselves before others invade them.” If a family or a nation falls into chaos, it will become vulnerable to external attacks and obstacles. “If there's no fire at home, no wildfire will start.” Outside factors are conditions, but the root cause is internal. Why do people say that schools are becoming businesses? Because some college and graduate students call their professors “boss.” Schools have become focused on grades and making money, neglecting the most important responsibility of a school: cultivating talents!

I also want to offer a sincere piece of advice to principals and kindergarten directors because I’ve been hurt by this myself. Can you tell? After resigning from my job, I wanted to take the teacher's exam again. Coincidentally, the school across from my home was hiring teachers. 191 people participated, going through a written exam, an oral exam, and a teaching demonstration. First, the written exam eliminated 170 people, leaving only 21. And out of these 21, only one was a man, the other 20 were women. So, when I was walking in for the second round of interviews, the school teachers saw me and said, "Oh, our school needs male teachers the most!" When I entered the interview room, three principals were sitting there. They said, "Oh, a man today!" After hearing this, I thought I was sure to get the job.

Before entering the interview, I prayed. I said, “May the ancestors of all the children here protect me and allow me to pass the exam. I will wholeheartedly dedicate my life to teaching at this school, and I will not transfer to another school.” Why? I would only teach students for a maximum of two years. In Taiwan, a homeroom teacher is with the first and second grade, then another teacher with third and fourth, and then another for fifth and sixth. So, I’d only be with a student for two years at most, and male teachers are generally assigned to the fifth and sixth grades. Why? Because the fifth and sixth graders are taller than us, it’s not that male teachers can't manage them. How can you truly help a student in just two years? So I hope that in those two years, they would remember one important thing, "The teacher really cares about me," and that's enough. I don't ask for much, just for them to trust me first. If I were to stay in that school for life, any student who trusted me would be able to find me. They would know that in the building across from the school, they could have red bean soup, they could have lotus seed and white fungus soup, that’s enough. My students would never walk down a path to destruction, because they would know that there is still someone in this world who cares for them. They wouldn't give up. If they stumble and hurt themselves, at least they would know they could come back to me, and I could teach them again. My plan was quite good, wasn't it? And I’ve also planned to teach traditional culture for free every Sunday in our community (our community has several hundred households). Otherwise, that space would be wasted. Many people would use it for karaoke, which is a waste because it's a sacred place. Now these children come here for classes, and they're learning to bow and pick up trash. Won't that shape the community’s culture for the better? It’s a good thing.

I had a good plan, and I was very sincere. I entered the room feeling confident, and sat down. The one sitting in the middle was the chief examiner. There were two other principals on each side, three principals in total. The first question the middle principal asked me—remembering that the principals are selecting talent for their school, talent for the education field—was: “Have you ever won any awards representing the school in competitions?” I had only taught for two years. I said, "No." He said, “Have you ever held an administrative position?” I was just a homeroom teacher; how would I have administrative experience? "No." "Have you ever led students to win any awards in competitions?” “No.” He asked me several questions, and I just kept shaking my head. As I was shaking my head, I thought to myself, “This isn’t good. I may not get the job.” In the end, I was on the waiting list, but still didn’t get the job. Not once did he ask me, "Do you have a caring heart?" The most important question to ask an educator was not asked. Why were they only asking about winning awards? Is the school's trophy cabinet more important than a good teacher doing their job well? We must constantly hold up a scale in our lives and weigh things.

From our own perspective, is our temper important, is our personality important, is our reputation important, or is the improvement of our mental state for our entire lives important? From a family perspective, is our reputation more important, is marrying off our daughter as quickly as possible more important, or is our daughter's lifelong happiness more important? In life, we must always hold up the scales to weigh things. Principals and kindergarten directors must also hold up a scale. Is a teacher with a caring heart more important, or one who can help you win awards? We must not forget our original intentions. What is it that we truly sought when we entered the education field?

Schools are not meant to exist for fame or profit. They exist to cultivate the next generation for society and the nation. This is what we must reflect upon. And why do people say that businesses are becoming schools? In mainland China, many businesses are incredibly admirable. They organize traditional culture courses that even the local Party schools come to learn from. A company organizing traditional culture classes and also helping the country to train its cadre, their sense of righteousness is even stronger than those of us in the education field. Do they not deserve our respect?

On the night of January 1, 2008, I was deeply impressed. I remember it vividly, because during that five-day course, we raised the national flag twice. First, we had the regular flag raising on Monday, and second, on New Year’s Day, the first day of the year, we raised the flag to stir up our hearts to love our country and our nation. Because China’s national anthem emphasizes that our nation is facing its "most dangerous time." Indeed, the transmission of our culture is critical for our generation. At that time, many entrepreneurs from Qingdao, over thirty people, stood up with a strong commitment, and each one vowed, “We will build Qingdao into a model city for traditional culture.” Then Principal Lu went up and said, "These are business owners who have such a mission for culture and education. I am a principal working in education.”  Shame is close to courage. So after that, Principal Lu went back and did an outstanding job, taking on the responsibility of revitalizing the teacher’s path.

Sixth, while we emphasize that respecting teachers is crucial for upholding the Way, we must also understand the objective situation. We often say "go with the flow," and those engaged in education must also go with the flow in the current circumstances. This reminds us of what our teacher often said about our teacher’s teacher, Mr. Li Bingnan. When facing a student who was truly willing to learn, he would scold and even hit them. Of course, he would do so behind closed doors, otherwise he would lose face as an elder. He thought about their face. But to those who were not willing to learn, he was very polite. Why? So as not to create resentment. While not creating resentment, when he was speaking on stage, he would offer sincere advice. If they were willing to accept it, they would be enlightened. If not, he would not create enmity, because they wouldn't feel as if he were specifically referring to them. But those who genuinely cherished learning would reflect on themselves, make adjustments, and benefit.

Today’s children lack filial piety. It’s even more difficult for them to understand the need to respect teachers, so you can't blame them. If you are too strict now, children may not be able to accept it immediately. So, this kind of connection depends on your own judgment. There's no fixed method. You have to look at the situation at the time and teach according to individual needs. If a child shows ten points of respect, and we teach him with only eight points, we are doing him a disservice. If a child shows only five points of respect, and we try to teach him with eight points, it's too demanding, and he will be scared away. If you are too strict and teach too much, he will feel pressure and run away. So you still need to "skillfully apply going with the flow.” Depending on the situation, go with the flow, observe the circumstances, and respond objectively.

I’ve shared these six angles, comparing the past and the present. Now we will talk about the third principle for respecting the teacher’s path, which is “revitalizing the teacher's path." First, “Respect yourself, and others will respect you." As those engaged in education, role models for others, this “role model” means setting an example, you must respect yourself. We must show that we care for our students as if they were our own children. Only in this way can we embody “Teachers and students are like father and son.”  “People can promote the Way, not the Way promotes people.” If we don’t embody it, how can we promote the Way? The most important spirit of parents and teachers is selfless and unrequited dedication. Therefore, they are respected. It is just like Lao Tzu's saying, "Creating without possessing, acting without expectation, accomplishing without taking credit." This is why parents and teachers are placed alongside heaven and earth. This time when I went to Changzhou, I saw memorial tablets in the ancestral halls: “Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parent, Teacher." Why can “Monarch, Parent, Teacher" be placed with “Heaven and Earth”? Because “Monarch, Parent, Teacher" all emulate the selfless spirit of heaven and earth, the spirit of nurturing all things, that's great. "Creating without possessing, acting without expectation, accomplishing without taking credit." "Creating" means creating all things, but not claiming possession, just like heaven and earth. Have heaven and earth ever asked for credit or rewards from the myriad of things they created? “Acting without expectation” means nurturing all things without arrogance or boasting, saying that everything is their doing.

Think about our parents, how much worry and hardship have they endured for us? They never ask for anything in return, and they continue to give their love to our partners and the next generation. Therefore, when children understand their parents' suffering, their lives will truly begin to shine. A life without filial piety is filled with actions that create negative karma. To feel resentment towards our parents, who have shown us such deep grace, creates an immense amount of negative karma. So, today parents are often helpless. We may not understand why they are worried about us because of the things we do. When a mother sighs and says, “Oh, why don't you listen to me!” we as children, seeing our parents sigh, can't truly feel their heart's burden. Instead, we become unhappy. “Why is Mom criticizing me? Why doesn’t she criticize my older brother and sisters?” See how much self-centeredness can harm people?

Why do parents sigh deeply? What is behind that sigh?  Our first thought is always self-centered. When things don’t go our way, we become unhappy. When someone talks to us, we become unhappy. When someone doesn’t trust us, we become unhappy. When someone doesn’t serve us, we become unhappy. Have we not become slaves to our own ego and selfishness? Is that what self-love truly is? People experience emotions, and that comes entirely from our ego and attachment to the self. To capture the thief, you must capture the leader. Do not be a slave to desire, and stop mistaking a thief for a father. The teachings of sages and saints teach us nothing more than self-love, and from that, we can learn to love others. First love our parents, and first appreciate their suffering. If we don't understand what that "sigh" means, we don’t know the many times we have caused them to worry. How many times did we get sick while growing up? How many times did we make mistakes with our friends, how many times were we not doing our job well, and how many times did we change jobs? How could each one of these events *not* have made parents worry?

Fortunately, I feel like our ancestors are protecting us. Several of my colleagues have children who are very well-behaved. If you read to them *Standards for Being a Good Student,* they stop crying. Lately, I have been holding a lot of babies, and I am often called “Grandpa.” This title is hard for me to accept, as I am only forty years old this year. Every time I hold these babies, they are only two or three months old, a “one hundred day life,” where their original, virtuous nature is truly expressed. Look at their bright eyes, with no discrimination or attachment, they are very cute, happy to be held by anyone. By five or six months old, they become wary of strangers. If it's not their mother, they cry. They start to discriminate, and they begin their attachments. If you want to see pure innocence, you have to look at babies who are two or three months old. When I hold them, I say to them, "Do you know how hard your mother works? I see how many diapers she changes for you, how many nights she doesn't get to sleep.” I just saw one of my colleagues, whose child was sick recently. After coming home from the hospital, the baby needed to nurse every half hour or hour. Can you imagine how exhausting that was? How could the mother get any sleep? She persevered through it, and now it’s getting a little easier. Five years from now, when I meet this child again, I will definitely tell him these things. I learned this from my grandfather. When I was young, because of my poor memory, my grandfather was always the one who would remind me of my mother's hard work. Education is a collective effort. Otherwise, children forget. We need relatives and friends to remind them. This is called "exchanging children for teaching." Because parents can't speak of this themselves, they feel that their love is natural and don’t expect to be thanked. While holding the baby, I said to him, “Do you know what you're here in this life to do?” The child looked puzzled. “You are here to promote the teachings of sages and saints.”  Then the child smiled, as if he had not forgotten why he was born.

“Acting without expectation, accomplishing without taking credit.”  Parents have sacrificed so much of their youth and effort for us and never ask for credit. In particular, having children can be an overwhelming experience, one of the greatest pains in life. But after the child is born, the parents immediately think about the child’s safety and well-being and completely let go of the pain. This one thought alone deserves a lifetime of gratitude from us as their children.

Then *Lao Tzu’s* classic text says, “Because they do not take credit, they are never forgotten.” The more they do not take credit, the more that things, particularly we humans, and those who have understanding, will not forget the grace of heaven and earth. Our ancestors all revered heaven and earth. I witnessed this recently. Coincidentally, I was supposed to fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the 13th, on the 5 pm flight, to fly back to Malaysia at 9 pm. But because of a typhoon, air traffic was congested, and I missed my flight back to Malaysia. So, I had to take the flight the next day. I stayed overnight in Shunde District of Foshan City, Guangdong. Because during the *Collected Essentials from the Governance* forum in Hong Kong, the most volunteers came from Shunde. So I thought, “I am so thankful for the people of Shunde.” Because of this thought, a few months later, I had the opportunity to visit Shunde, and it was very educational for me. Just their place names were very educational, all of which incorporate Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Did you notice? “Foshan City, Shunde District” meaning following the virtue of nature and the virtue of enlightenment. What are the towns under their district? “Lunjiao Town,” which means the teaching of ethics and morality. Then there is “Daliang Town,” using the character “liang” for conscience. And then there’s “Xingtan Town,” where Confucius lectured. I was amazed when I learned these. There was also "Chan Town" the Chan of Chan Buddhism. When I entered the home of a friend there, I was stunned to see that they worship heaven, with the words "Heavenly Officials Bestow Blessings." They worshipped the heavenly deities. Then I saw they worshiped the earth, respecting the land god. I saw that they worshiped their ancestors. And in the kitchen, they worshiped the kitchen god. They thank and show gratitude for all the acts of grace and do not forget them. While I was in the car, before I even arrived at their house, they mentioned that there were many typhoons in Guangdong Province, but when the typhoons reached the area near Shunde, they would dissipate, never arriving.

What is the knowledge of our ancestors called? The unity of heaven and humans. Why don’t typhoons go there? The people in that area respect heaven, earth, their ancestors, and the kitchen god in every household. They have kind hearts, so they have good fortune and less disaster. This is not a coincidence, just like Malaysia not having earthquakes is also not a coincidence. One single example can prove this truth. The Chinese primary schools have more than 1200 branches. For decades the Chinese community has raised money to maintain the transmission of Chinese culture. This is not done anywhere else in the world. Every salary payment is mindful of the need to preserve the culture. How much good fortune does this generate? So, the establishment of the Han Academy in Malaysia is not a coincidence either. In the world, nothing is coincidental. Everything has its causes, and thus its results. When we see this, we should emulate this spirit as a monarch, as a teacher, and as a parent.

There was a teacher, and more than a thousand people came to his funeral, even more solemn than any official's funeral. Because he taught students for his entire life, and his students had all become successful, they all gathered together. They all shared the same feeling, that when their teacher first took their class, they all thought the teacher was very strict. But two or three months later, they realized that even though their teacher was strict, it was for their benefit. After graduating, the students would often go back to see their teacher. When they met, they would say to their teacher, “Teacher, please scold me a few times! It's been so long since anyone scolded me.” The scolding must have been related to proper conduct, so these students deeply appreciated how their teacher had educated them on the philosophy and understanding of life. They all gathered together at his funeral. This helps us understand, “because they do not take credit.” This teacher did not take credit, but his selfless love was left in the hearts of those thousand-plus students, “they are never forgotten.” This is the first point of revitalizing the teacher's path, "Respect yourself, and others will respect you."

The second point is on page 107 of *Collected Essentials of Governance, Vol. 360: On Government: Focus on the Fundamentals.* Actually, governing is the management of people's affairs. Leading a class or a school is also the management of people’s affairs, and it has a relationship with governing. We see that this classic line says: “Only by knowing how to be a son can you be a father. Only by knowing how to be a subject can you be a ruler. Only by knowing how to serve others can you employ them.”


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and clear English rendering while maintaining the original meaning and tone:

**Translation:**

I added a sentence at the end, "Only by being a virtuous student can one become a virtuous teacher." How can we become teachers if we cannot even be good students? This sentence speaks to the idea that one must understand how to be a good son before knowing how to play the role of a good father. This is how filial piety can be passed down. Similarly, one must know how to be a good subject before knowing how to be a good ruler. One should start from the grassroots level, being obedient and diligent. With this attitude, when promoted, one will be able to empathize with those below. If someone simply gets an MBA, a Master's or Doctorate in Management, and is immediately made a leader, they will only have theoretical knowledge, and may even be arrogant, making it difficult for them to manage effectively. One must understand how to serve others before understanding how to employ others. Furthermore, when employing people, because they have been through it themselves, they can guide others hand-in-hand, enabling the passing down of skills and experience. If one has no experience themselves and only spouts theoretical knowledge, it is also very difficult to lead those below effectively. Therefore, only by being a virtuous student can one become a virtuous teacher.

So, who do we learn from as students? Who do we learn from to become virtuous students? Next week, we will share with everyone the sixth key point of "Being Your Child's Lifelong Benefactor": The Model of an Educator – The Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius. Why do we cite Confucius? Because Confucius was the best student, which is why he became the Supreme Sage and Teacher. We often think of Confucius in terms of his role as a teacher, but we overlook the many attitudes Confucius displayed as a student in the *Analects*. These attitudes were the key to his achievements in morality and scholarship. Therefore, the sixth point is, we will learn from Confucius about his approach to learning and his model as a teacher.

The seventh key point is that we will discuss together the importance of "self-education" for educators. We learn from sages and virtuous people, but it’s difficult to be reading the classics or attending lectures all the time. Therefore, in our daily interactions and when dealing with things, our every word, action, and thought must be self-examined and self-taught. Otherwise, learning is like rowing against the current; if we do not advance, we will fall behind. If we don’t know where our thoughts and actions go wrong every day, we are only deteriorating. In name, we are learning from the teachings of the sages, but in reality, we are living in complacency every day, wasting our lives. We may even be retreating in fear, afraid to break through our own personalities and bad habits. This all depends on self-education.

We must understand that everyone's help is merely a contributing factor. Who is the main character in our life? It is ourselves. "Heaven helps those who help themselves; Heaven saves those who save themselves." Those who give up on themselves cannot be helped by "Heaven." The term "Heaven" here refers to all the circumstances we encounter in this life; they cannot help us either if we do not help ourselves. And how much help parents and teachers, these beneficial relationships, can offer, and how much effect they can have, is actually determined by us. The more we cherish it, the more we benefit. As mentioned earlier, the broader and deeper the roots of a tree, the more water it absorbs. Therefore, understand the connection, cherish the connection, and create the connection; know the blessings, cherish the blessings, and create blessings; understand the kindness, feel grateful for the kindness, and repay the kindness.

This is our discussion of the second sentence, which comes from the phrase "focus on the fundamentals" in "360 Books," derived from *Confucius Family Sayings Essential Teachings*. Well, our discussion of revitalizing the teacher's way is not yet finished. We will continue to discuss it next week. Thank you all for today!

Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy and natural flow:

**Lecture 9: The Dignity of the Teacher's Path: 3. Revitalizing the Teacher's Path**

Esteemed colleagues in the field of education, respected elders, and fellow alumni, good afternoon!

In our last session, we discussed the “dignity of the teacher's path.” From the perspective of us educators, we need to understand the importance of the teacher's role. This is about self-respect and self-love. We can further appreciate how crucial respect for teachers is for learners; when students respect their teachers, they can then value the Way. This is an act of love. An educator shouldn't have a mindset that demands respect; with such a mindset, it's difficult to be a good teacher. To demand respect is, in fact, being unhumble. Rather, it's about enabling children and students to gain real benefit from their learning, which is why we must encourage an atmosphere of respect for teachers. In essence, the sages teach us to always think about the students and others, rather than demanding things from them.

In our last session, we also compared the prevalence of respect for teachers in ancient times with the current situation. If we want to return society to a healthy state where teachers are respected, the third key point is to revitalize the teacher's path. This was our focus last time. Revitalizing the teacher's path relies on teachers themselves to do so. Self-respect leads to others' respect, and self-love leads to others' love. A teacher’s role is to awaken others' wisdom. How is wisdom manifested? By thinking about matters from their root, not just their branches. As the saying goes, “The noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Way arises.”

Last time, we discussed that, to revitalize the teacher's path, the first point is that we must have self-respect to earn the respect of others. Second, we cited the 177th line from *Group Writings 360*. This is what we talked about last time—that a teacher should embody a spirit of focusing on the root. "One must first know how to be a good child before one can be a good father; one must know how to be a good subject before one can be a good ruler; one must know how to serve others before one can command others." For us educators, this means we must first know how to be good disciples of the sages, how to be good students of the sages, before we can become teachers. If we cannot be good disciples to our own parents, teachers, or sage ancestors, how can we be someone else's teacher? Having this understanding, to be a good disciple, we must start by fulfilling our duties. As we now work in education, what are the duties of an educator? In Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty's *Teacher’s Discourse*, it's mentioned – this is our third key point, regarding revitalizing the teacher's path – “Know one’s duties”: “The teacher’s duty is to transmit the Way, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts.” Transmitting the Way, imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts are the responsibilities of a teacher.

Once, when I was studying at a teachers' college, my advisor, Teacher Yin, asked us a question: if a teacher’s role is merely to transmit knowledge, can a teacher compete with a computer? No, right? So, there's no need for teachers, a computer will do. It's faster to find information. We teachers sometimes draw blanks and can’t recall things. But a computer, with just a few clicks on the internet, everything pops up. Clearly, teaching knowledge isn't the core value of a teacher. Otherwise, how can we compete with computers? A teacher can teach children how to learn, how to find information, and how to apply that knowledge and those skills; that's about teaching virtue.

Moreover, the human heart is very subtle. Many students with excellent grades do not really respect their teachers. Why? They may feel that all that information can be easily found online. So, in those few years when I was teaching, when I met students who were number one or two in the class on the street, they didn't even greet me. But what type of student would? They'd spot the teacher from fifty meters away, wave their hand high and say, "Hello, Teacher!" very excitedly, and it's those who got disciplined by me the most. Why? Because they had made mistakes and they knew it was for their own good that they were being taught. So even though you might have hit them, they know you were doing it for their benefit. Of course, I hear now you aren’t allowed to hit them. It's been eleven years since I left the education field. We should go with the flow in everything we do, if you can't hit, then don't. It's not that hitting is the only way to teach a child well. As long as you are sincere, the child can gradually feel it. Of course, don’t think I like hitting students from what I am saying. I have only hit one or two times, those were for students who didn’t understand, after explaining for a long time, and who only understood the stick. At the time, it was the only effective way.

From my own experience, and from what my mother told me, after teaching for decades she also noticed this phenomenon. If you teach a child how to be a person, the child will naturally respect you. A school leader also told me that teachers who use the *Standards for Students* in school are very popular. Students would come to them with any kind of problem. Firstly, of course, they were more compassionate, and they taught the *Standards for Students*, meaning that they were concerned about the children’s virtue. Like our theme this time, “Be a Noble Benefactor in a Child’s Life," it is to think about the child’s lifelong happiness, and children can feel that. Moreover, because teaching the *Standards for Students* teaches filial piety, brotherly love, and compassion, which align with human nature, the children naturally respect the teachers. So, when we see today's students respecting teachers less and less, that’s a result. We should look at the cause and “look within when you don’t get the results you want.” If we do not transmit the Way, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts, how can students respect us?

In March of 1973, an incident occurred in the United States. An American political and economic journal reported that a graduate of Harvard Business School (What do you feel when you hear "Harvard"? It’s a top school, and this was the business school) sued his teacher. Because he had followed the academic theories that his teacher taught him, he had failed in his management of finances at a large company and was subsequently fired. He calculated his job loss to be about 700,000 US dollars. This happened 40 years ago. He was suing his teacher for 700,000 dollars. This kind of thing seemed very common in the US. For example, the judge handling this case would think that when any product harms a consumer, the manufacturer should be responsible for compensation. If a student fails in business using the material taught by his teacher, the teacher should also not be able to escape responsibility. This was the judge’s logic. But in China, it would be unheard of. What do foreigners consider the teacher's teaching to be? A commodity, a source of profit, not the "Way." If it is a commodity and there's no transmission of the Way, how can one earn respect? So, being sued by a student is not a very big deal in America.

This passage actually has a lot of food for thought for us. First of all, are the principles taught by this university professor true? Even though he's a business school professor, is what he taught the truth? It’s very interesting. If what he taught is the truth, then this professor should be the richest person, right? He understands it the most; he’s the expert, and he should be applying it the best and making the most money, why is he just a professor? Therefore, the true cause of wealth is not necessarily in university textbooks, but in our Chinese classics. What is the true cause of wealth? Being charitable and generous: "A family that accumulates good deeds is sure to have surplus blessings." The giving of wealth leads to wealth, and that is the fundamental cause. Otherwise, if these textbooks contained truth, everyone who applied them would become rich, so how is it that some people are rich and some are not?

Today, we are using what is taught in the classics, which is that filial piety is the basis for running the family and building the nation. Which family that practices filial piety has not prospered? All of them prosper! Diligence and thrift are the basis for maintaining a household. Which family has failed by being diligent and thrifty? None of them! True principles hold true across all times and places. All results are caused by good causes and conditions leading to good results. However, many books do not point out the true causes, but only the conditions. It's like a seed being planted; watering and fertilizing are the conditions, while the seed itself is the cause. If you don't have the cause of giving and charity, and you just try hard to make money, you still might not get it, that’s a condition. Thus, the timeless and unchanging principles are in the classics.

Many of today's textbooks are what people imagine and experience, and they may not align with true principles. A truly wise person will abide by the classics as their teacher, rather than their own creations and inventions. Confucius also took this stance: "I transmit rather than create; I believe in and love antiquity." In this age, we do not believe in truth or in sages, and many people rely on their own ideas and, if they are famous, many others will follow them, and it’s a disaster. To give an example, someone who had won a Nobel Prize had his quote compiled into textbooks, stating, "The sole purpose of a business is to make a profit." This was in textbooks for a long time. This is why so many businesses damage nature and are so reckless; they don’t care; rivers are polluted, the soil is polluted, they don’t care. "The sole purpose of a business is to make a profit." This is a great fallacy and it is still in the textbooks.

This brings to mind Dr. Ariffin, the Islamic scholar from Malaysia. He has wisdom. When the UNESCO organization introduced a Malaysian textbook for him to review, he rejected it. He said that this book didn't even contain Confucius's teachings, therefore it wasn’t up to standard. He had discernment. This sentence of "sole purpose is to make profit" is harming the world. If it was reviewed against the teachings of Confucius, it would be immediately discarded, how can it even be included? Confucius says in the *Analects*, “The noble person understands what is right, whereas the petty person understands what is profitable.”  A noble person loves wealth but gains it through the right way, a petty person only thinks about gaining profit for themselves. So this quote is the thinking of a petty person, how can it be put into a textbook?

So when we see these phenomena, we realize that, in the *Group Writings 360* that we studied, Confucius said to Duke Ai of Lu, that there are five misfortunes of the world: “when sages hide themselves, fools usurp authority, that is a misfortune for the world.” The teachings of the sages are not believed and no one wants to study them deeply. These petty ideas and utilitarian thinking fill the world, even the thinking of each person. This is how chaos happens.

Earlier we talked about what happened in the US 40 years ago. We saw that even the judges think that what teachers teach is a commodity. Have you ever felt that, since the Industrial Revolution, even humans have become commodities? Humans have dignity and personality; how can they be regarded as commodities? Dear colleagues, if you are in a workplace where people only see you as a part of the production line, how do you feel? Uncomfortable. Our students are they like commodities now? They are being treated the same way instead of being educated according to their talents. What does "treated the same" mean? Math and Language, Language and Math, Math and Language, that's what they do every day, being processed on the production line, and after that, what happens when they graduate from university? They're returned! People don't want them. Many university graduates, master's graduates, PhD graduates, can't find a job now.

Tell me, in this society, what company tells you, that they want people who are good at taking tests? Which business owner says, that they want people who have high scores in math in high school, like 95/100? But when you look at our whole process of educating children, most of the focus is on tests and as a result, they become test-taking machines. Once they enter society, they don't know how to behave or how to work, they are not good employees. When they get married, they are not good husbands or wives. When they have children, they are not good fathers or mothers because they have never properly learned the principles of being a person or managing affairs. So, to make children happy in life, we must return to transmitting the Way, imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts.

This article was published in the *A Brief Introduction to Confucianism*, published by the Lotus Society in Taichung. The article also mentions how the ancient Chinese sages regarded their students as their children. This part is important, as the next point we'll discuss is that the best role model for teachers is the most holy teacher, Confucius. He is our standard for the field of education, our best example. Confucius viewed all his students "as if they were his own children.” This is what is talked about in the *Analects*. When Yan Hui passed away, Confucius was extremely saddened. He wasn't just sad because his student had passed away, he was sad because the world had lost such a great sage, because his students are meant to spread the Way and teach others. When Zilu died and was chopped into meat paste, Confucius was so grieved he didn’t eat meat paste from that day on. When Confucius passed away, his disciples all mourned for him for three years. Many of his disciples stayed by his grave for three years, while Zigon stayed for six years. The sages provide such examples for us. Therefore, later generations of students have regarded teachers like a gentle breeze bringing needed rain. Teachers have regarded disciples like budding peach and plum trees. So the relationship between teacher and student is very beautiful.

The relationship between teacher and student is so profound because it is bound by the Way. Although the Way is formless, it has immeasurable power. For example, when a student has the Way, they can manifest their luminous virtue, they can become close to the people, they can realize their own potential, they can benefit themselves and others and the world. If the nation and people value the Way of the Teacher, then our nation will influence the world. This is the power of the Way. Like in the Tang Dynasty, when the traditional culture was highly regarded, so Japan and Korea, neighboring countries all came to learn Chinese culture. Emperor Taizong of Tang was regarded by the world as the “Heavenly Khan,” the supreme ruler respected by all.

From these examples, we can realize that a teacher's duty is to transmit the Way, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts. The "Way" is a principle of nature beyond time and space. Whether in being a person or in managing affairs, it is an unchanging principle. Abiding by this principle, and not deviating from it in our conduct, that's “virtue.” Therefore, we must transmit morality, teach morality. In the Way, the relationship between people is the Way, inseparable from the five relationships: “Filial piety between father and son”. The closeness is virtue; the father and son relationship is the Way. "Justice between ruler and subject."  The ruler and subject relationship is the Way, and justice is the virtue. "Distinction between husband and wife".  Husband’s justice and wife's virtue, husband and wife is the way; the distinction is the virtue. The husband’s justice is the virtue; and when he abides by this, the husband will be just, and the wife will have the virtue of assisting the husband and educating their children. We generally talk about the four virtues of a woman: womanly virtue; womanly speech, refining her language; womanly work, the ability to manage a household; and womanly appearance, her dignified appearance, which influences the next generation's behavior.

Let's look at transmitting the Way, imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts from these three perspectives. First, when we think about the Way of the five relationships, we think about what Confucius said to Zengzi at the beginning of the *Classic of Filial Piety*, "The former kings had perfect virtue and essential ways to bring harmony to the world, and through this the people lived harmoniously, without resentment between superiors and inferiors.” The ancient sage kings had the highest of paths (the most important principles for governing the world), when this was applied, relationships were very harmonious, “without resentment between superiors and inferiors," meaning there was harmony between fathers and sons, elders and younger generations, also between officials and citizens, and between those of high and low status. How was this achieved? Through filial piety. With filial piety, fathers and sons are close and families are in harmony. “Transfer filial piety to loyalty; when the noble person serves their parents with filial piety, they can transfer that loyalty to the ruler.” Therefore, they will be loyal and respectful to the leader, and not rebellious. This all comes from filial piety. Thus, the "Way" is the core of Chinese culture, and "filial piety" is the most important. When we read this passage in the *Classic of Filial Piety*, we deeply long for this: “The people lived harmoniously, without resentment between superiors and inferiors.” We wish that our family and society could have this kind of atmosphere. So if a teacher doesn’t teach filial piety, then they haven’t transmitted the Way. As the saying goes, “Of all good deeds, filial piety is the foremost,” meaning that filial piety is the most important; furthermore, it also means that when the heart of filial piety opens up, then all good deeds follow.

When we speak of morality, we often think of the five relationships and eight virtues. The eight virtues have two versions, and together they have twelve virtues: filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, justice, integrity, shame, benevolence, love, peace, and harmony. Filial piety is the root of being a person, fraternal respect is the foundation, propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are the trunk, and benevolence, love, peace, and harmony are the flowers and fruit of being a person. The realization of all twelve virtues is actually very natural and according to human nature. Education should follow human nature; then people will learn naturally and absorb knowledge easily. Have you ever heard that in ancient times, in our 5,000-year history, someone committed suicide because they were too stressed from reading? Never. Even in the recent Qing Dynasty, it’s rare to have heard of that, but why has it become like this today? When going along with human nature they can easily accept it: “To learn and to apply that learning at regular intervals, is this not also a pleasure?”

When we look at filial piety, it's about serving our parents, caring for our parents; in the extended family, it means respecting elders: fraternal respect, loyalty, trustworthiness. When it comes to propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, it's about serving our leaders, serving the organization. When it comes to benevolence, love, peace, and harmony, it is to love everyone. It’s a very natural progression from loving and caring for our parents to respecting elders in the extended family. Fraternal respect, is respecting and loving older siblings and caring for younger siblings. Loyalty and trustworthiness are the sense of responsibility and motivation in one's life. Loyalty is about giving your all; to give your all to be filial to your parents so that your parents have a good life. We can see this in the previous generation; why did they work so hard in their studies and in their careers? They wanted to repay their parents. But with our generation, what do they work hard for? To enjoy, to quickly earn a lot of money, to travel in Europe, to travel here and there. Their motivation is different; it is not about being loyal to parents or family. As Chinese people, we all have this kind of attitude in life, which is to bring glory to our ancestors and our family. That is our life's motivation: loyalty. Trust is about always pushing yourself to fulfill what you have promised. Dear colleagues, have we ever made promises to our parents or relatives in our heart? Those promises will give us endless motivation to move forward.

Propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are about serving our leaders. Propriety, justice, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a country, and the four pillars of a group. We just finished studying the importance of this in *Group Writings 360*. Then expanding to the general public and to the people of the world, that’s benevolence, love, peace, and harmony which is the flower and fruit. This chart (the chart of the twelve virtues) is important for us because we can't have rootless education. Without roots, how can there be branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit? But when we calm down and think about it, in school we emphasize “loving our classmates, loving the world, we are a global village,” can they actually love? They still are greedy with food and won’t share with their classmates. They still litter and don’t care; so what is this love for the world?

Why have we put in so much effort, manpower, and money, and isn’t the money being spent on education a lot worldwide? But the quality of the next generation keeps declining. How can we spend so much effort and money, but still not be able to produce good people? The fundamentals are most important. In education we often talk about the fact that over 90% of people graduate from junior high, which means the level of education is very high, right? However, in ancient times, not many people were well educated, but they all understood filial piety, all understood how to behave, as it was taught at home and in society. Now everyone goes to school, but they don’t know how to behave. The important thing is that hard work does not necessarily mean good results; focusing on the secondary while neglecting the primary will never lead to good results.

Therefore, filial piety is the root of education and the foundation of Chinese culture. The deeper this understanding, the more you know that even if everyone else doesn’t teach filial piety, you must still teach it. Others not understanding it is their business. But if we have this determination and wholeheartedly teach it, it will prove to the world that a child who knows filial piety is virtuous and has a better academic performance. Why is that? "To do what the parents like, we will do everything we can". If the parents hope the child will do well in school, how can they bear to worry their parents? Therefore, in Songhua Jiang Middle School in Jilin, Northeast China, they focused on the core of filial piety, and their entire learning performance improved dramatically. The experience of applying the *Standards for Students* in Jilin Songhua Jiang has had a great impact on the education of Northeast China and even in the rest of mainland China. They called it the "Songhua Jiang Effect."


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Title: On Filial Piety and the Foundation of Virtue**

It just so happened that in 2010, our Principal Lu Jie and Teacher Wang Qi also shared their experiences with over 2,500 principals and teachers at Northern University in Malaysia.

So, what are we exploring next?  When filial piety opens up, all virtues open up. Let's examine the "Eight Virtues," which are inseparable from benevolence. How does "fraternal respect" (悌) arise?  "Elder brothers should be loving, younger brothers should be respectful; When brothers are harmonious, filial piety is found within." Where does a person's "loyalty" (忠) come from? It also comes from filial piety.  If one is loyal to their parents, they will naturally be loyal to others as well.  If one loves their parents, they will understand how to love others.  How can one love others if they do not even love their parents, those who are the greatest benefactors?  Therefore, the origin of love is filial piety. The *Classic of Filial Piety* tells us, "Those who do not love their parents but love others are said to violate virtue," which is abnormal and goes against proper conduct. "Trustworthiness" (信): "When parents give an order, do not be lazy in carrying it out."  When promising something to one's parents, one should quickly fulfill it, demonstrating honesty first and foremost to them.  "Propriety" (禮): "When parents call, answer without delay." One should be very respectful and reverent to their parents, engaging in "morning greetings and evening settling," all of which are attitudes of reverence.  "Righteousness" (義): having a strong sense of justice and compassion. “During the three-year mourning period, one should often be filled with sadness.” You see, the roots of all these virtues cannot be separated from the practice of "being filial at home." "Integrity" (廉): being honest and not greedy. "Even if something is small, do not hide it secretly; if one hides it secretly, the parents’ hearts will be hurt."  "Shame" (恥): having a sense of shame.  "If virtue is damaged, one brings shame upon their parents."  The root of shame also comes from filial piety.  "Benevolence" (仁):  thinking of others as much as one thinks of oneself. Essentially it is "keeping them warm in winter and cool in summer," is it not? Isn't this about putting yourself in your parents’ shoes and considering their needs? This is benevolence.  "Love" (愛):  "When parents are sick, taste the medicine first; attend to them day and night, never leaving their bedside." This refers to the deep, all-encompassing care and attention for parents when they are ill.

I believe I shared with you before, that during my trip to Nanjing, I met Teacher Wang Xihai, who had been meticulously caring for his father who had suffered a stroke for over twenty years.  Looking at the character for "love" (愛), we must feel it with our hearts. He understood his father’s needs simply by looking at his expressions. It is true that the hearts of parents and children are connected, it is inherent.  Because his father was bedridden, he was most afraid of getting bedsores. Bedsores, once they ulcerate, are difficult to turn over, and are truly agonizing and unbearable. He thought, "My father is already in so much pain, how can I let him develop bedsores?" He felt that his father suffering from bedsores was a great shame and fault of his.  But to prevent bedsores, one must frequently turn over the patient. So, he came up with a way: He would slide his hand under his father's waist.  His father weighed eighty kilograms, a substantial weight, and when his father’s body rested entirely on his hand, he would feel his hand go numb after about half an hour. Then he would wake up, quickly turn his father over, and give him a massage.  So, even after being ill for a decade or two, his father’s skin was still very smooth and elastic.  Doctors did not believe that his father had been suffering from a stroke for so long; they thought that he was deceiving them. When they looked up his medical records, doctors were moved to tears by his filial devotion. They said, “Your caregiving skills could be a model for all our nurses.  They should all learn from you.”

So, who has creativity? Our entire education system is emphasizing innovation and creativity, but what is the root of creativity? Filial piety and love! Things created without filial piety and love might have serious side effects.  Therefore, "both virtue and talent" are necessary. Virtue is the foundation, while talent is its application.  To have talent without virtue is dangerous.  How many teenagers are now addicted to violent video games? Who designed those games?  People who are very capable and have advanced skills, but lack the foundation of virtue. 

You see, Teacher Wang Xihai, by putting himself in his father's shoes, was able to come up with these solutions. He also mentioned that it is unacceptable for a person to see their bedridden father unable to defecate for days without proactively seeking a solution. Why?  Wouldn’t not being able to defecate for days be incredibly uncomfortable?  So why aren't the children taking action? He witnessed this phenomenon in hospitals and felt very sorry.  The important thing is that the children were not thinking of their parents, were not empathizing with their bedridden parents. So, he proactively massaged his father’s abdomen, used a hot compress, and then applied a hot compress to his father’s anus.  Finally, his father was able to defecate without issue and felt relieved. He was overjoyed when his father defecated on his hand, finally resolving his father's problem.  Therefore, a person who is able to hold their parent's feces during their caregiving is the most blessed, because they are repaying their debt of gratitude. Our parents cared for us in the same way when we were young, feeding us and cleaning up our waste without any disgust. We should also show the same heart and filial respect to our parents.

After sharing this method, we met a Teacher Zheng. Her father was bedridden and also unable to defecate. She used this method and it was indeed effective.  During my recent trip to Nanjing, Teacher Zheng also happened to come to see us and met Teacher Wang Xihai. She was extremely moved and thanked him profusely. It reminded me of a classic saying, "A filial child will never be lacking, and will forever bring blessings to their kind." This means that a filial child's actions, their utmost filial piety, will definitely move those who hear of it and inspire them to emulate it, bringing benefit to all of humanity. Just like when we read the "Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety," we are immediately moved by the example of Emperor Shun, or the story of Zi Lu carrying rice a hundred li to feed his parents. If a person’s heart is very hardened, first have them read the "Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety," and tears will flow, softening their hearts. These are all examples of utmost filial piety that are truly moving.

From the examples we have just seen, we can see the meticulous love of a filial child. "Harmony" (和): A filial child, when interacting with their parents, will never say a single unpleasant or emotional word, never. Even if the parents are wrong, they will "gently try to correct their parents’ faults; with a kind expression and a soft voice,  if the advice isn’t taken, then try again happily.” Look how flexible and soft their heart is. Even if the parents cannot accept it, they will try to persuade them again when they are in a good mood. What does "again" mean?  It means to repeatedly persuade them, without being impatient. "If scolded or beaten, one should harbor no resentment." If the parents do not understand and even beat them, they still have no complaints. Their hearts remain peaceful.  The peacefulness in "harmony" is honed here.

In the *Analects*, there is a passage very similar in meaning to the *Standards for Students*’ saying, "Gently try to correct parents’ faults." “When serving one's parents, offer gentle advice.” Confucius taught that in order to fulfill filial piety and serve your parents, "if you see that your parents are not following the advice, you should still be respectful and obedient, working diligently without resentment.”  Serving your parents also entails nurturing their wisdom. Parents are not sages and will inevitably make mistakes. But when parents make mistakes, one should offer advice "slightly," at the first signs of error, so as to prevent major problems from arising. If you see that your parents are not very receptive, you cannot force them, and should try to persuade them again next time. However, your attitude towards your parents should still be one of respect, even greater respect.  If we communicate with our parents, and they cannot accept our suggestions, we may become unhappy or resentful. Then, we will not be able to achieve "still be respectful and obedient."  Even more seriously, people everywhere are speaking ill of their parents. This is way off the mark. And to be frank, a person who goes around telling others of their parents' or relatives’ misdeeds is bringing shame upon themselves. There's a saying: "Family scandals should not be publicized."  Have you ever heard of a person telling others about the shameful behavior of their spouse, parents, or siblings and then have them say, “Oh, I truly admire you! I bow down to you.” No! Instead, people who hear that will mock your family and look down on you.

The *Standards for Students* states, “It is our duty to gently try to correct our parents’ faults. When we can advise each other with kindness, we will build up good character; not pointing out each other’s faults will cause harm to both.”  We should remember our duties and our proper attitude in life, “Remember kindness, forget resentment.” Always remember the kindness of parents and family members. Never harbor resentment toward them. This is the correct attitude in life.  We, as teachers, must be very clear about these attitudes.  Why?  Because this is the key to whether a person will be happy or miserable their entire life.  A person who remembers kindness and forgets resentment, when will they be happy? They will be happy and joyful in the present moment. When your heart is full of gratitude for your parents and loved ones, you will live every day with purpose. Why? Because you are repaying that kindness!

However, today people do not understand these principles of filial piety and living a good life. On the contrary, they remember resentment and forget kindness. If you think calmly, look at what is happening around us. For example, colleagues or friends who were very close for three or five years might suddenly have a falling out and then spend all their time criticizing the other. They forget all the good that happened during the past three or five years. This is a topsy-turvy way to live, violating the principles of a proper attitude in life. The *Standards for Students* describes the fundamental attitude for living, “Gratitude should be repaid, resentment should be forgotten.”  To be frank, those who are unwilling to remember kindness and forget resentment do not understand how to love themselves. So how many people know how to love themselves?  Those who are living life with this attitude are making themselves miserable. Are those who remember resentment and forget kindness happy? Have you ever seen a person ranting about someone for a long time and then say, "Wow, that feels so good"? No!  So, how many people truly understand how to love themselves?  They should follow their inherent nature, be happy at all times, find joy in helping others, and find the greatest joy in doing good. Who knows how to live a good life? Only those who are willing to follow the *Standards for Students*.

"Still be respectful and obedient, working diligently without resentment." This "diligently" means that even if you have to advise your parents many times, and they still don’t listen, you still should not have any resentment. Don’t even talk about advising other people.  How many times do we have to be advised before we listen? Actually, if we think about ourselves, we might slowly develop patience. Looking back, have we changed our bad habits after studying Chinese culture for so many years? If our parents say, “Why are you so stubborn? Why are you like that?" that might be our biggest problem. If we have not been able to change even after learning for so long, how can we expect others to change after only being told once or twice? Isn't that harsh?  We should be strict with ourselves and lenient with others. It should not be the opposite. Being strict with others and lenient with ourselves is a topsy-turvy way of thinking.  So if we don’t understand these principles clearly, we are prone to living a topsy-turvy life.

If you think about it calmly, are young people today able to be harmonious in a group setting, able to avoid conflict and confrontation? It’s not easy. So, the root of it all comes back to filial piety.  If we look at these twelve virtues, they reflect the order of self-cultivation, family management, governance of the state, and peace throughout the world.  When a person begins their self-cultivation with filial piety, they will be able to achieve a life that benefits the country and the world. The spirit of self-cultivation, family management, filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty and trustworthiness is what humanity has been discussing for the past one to two hundred years, when talking about nationalism. Everyone wants their nation to be more united. If you look closely, how many countries are experiencing division right now?  The Soviet Union split into many countries. Many people of the same ethnic background are now fighting each other. It is heartbreaking to see. Yet our Chinese nation has maintained its unity for thousands of years. This is unique in the world. The key to this is the importance placed on the education of filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness for the past thousands of years. This has resulted in a united nation. In the past, people lived in groups of two to three hundred, or even four or five hundred people, and they were very united. Therefore, filial piety and fraternal respect are the foundations, and loyalty and trustworthiness are the motivation for living a good life. As we discussed earlier, it’s about bringing glory to their ancestors, and so the nation is very united.

Therefore, in emphasizing many theories and -isms, we must grasp that virtue is the foundation. For example, in governing a country, everyone now emphasizes the importance of civil rights and democratic societies. In the past one or two hundred years, humanity has spent a great deal of time pondering these political systems, but it seems that the politics of the world are not getting better. They've put in a lot of effort but haven't gotten good results. Think calmly about what I've just said: a lot of effort but no good results. Where can we find this phenomenon? We can see it in individuals, families, countries, societies, and even the world.

First, consider our health. Do we spend a lot of time and money on health and nutrition in this era? Yes, we do.  Is the effect good?  Why is everyone's health getting worse and worse? Because they have not grasped the root cause. What is the root cause? Self-cultivation. If you eat so much nutritional food, but you have a bad temper, will you get better? Furthermore, they don't understand how to live in harmony with nature and they stay up late even after eating all those nutritional foods. They are not grasping the root, wasting a lot of energy, money, and time, yet not seeing much good results. This is what the ancestors called putting the cart before the horse.  In the family, people spend a lot of time educating their children, but the children who are being raised are less well-behaved than before because people have not grasped the foundation. As we discussed, this foundation is filial piety.

Also, the world has been studying so many political systems. Political systems are secondary. What is fundamental? The virtue and character of the people is fundamental. So, hard work does not always guarantee good results, because the root has not been grasped. What is the root of politics? Virtue. "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four cardinal principles of a nation." If you only emphasize civil rights and freedoms, the result is that ordinary people will directly curse the country's leaders, without respect! Politicians do not learn propriety, so we see many instances of politicians fighting.  If politicians fight, how can their children not fight? Can the U.S., which has initiated so many wars, teach its children not to fight? So, the high crime rate among American youth is not accidental, is it? It’s a matter of leaders setting an example. If the older generations act so poorly, how can they possibly teach the next generation?  This is about propriety. Next is righteousness. Righteousness means that one should act with righteousness toward the people, and seek to improve their well-being. If politicians lack righteousness, they will use their power for personal gain, for their own selfish desires. Therefore, there are many more politicians than there used to be. But it is still a problem of education, not a problem of the political system. Are countries that claim their political systems are very good actually better off?  No, because they have overlooked the most fundamental thing.  If they have integrity, they will not be corrupt, and there is no need to create many systems to prevent corruption. That only provides temporary solutions. When one has a sense of shame, one will not do things that go against their conscience. So, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the most important core principles for civil rights and the democratic system, that is, virtue.

Benevolence, love, and peace are what people have been emphasizing for the past one to two hundred years: You have to improve the people’s lives. If people lack benevolence, it is just a slogan. Today, many people are engaging in many actions that seem to be for the benefit of the people, but are actually doing it for personal gain and self-aggrandizement, because their self-interest and selfishness have not been abandoned. Only with a heart of benevolence, love, and peace can we truly do our best to protect society. As it is mentioned in "The Great Harmony" in the *Classic of Rites*: "People should not only treat their own parents as parents, and only care for their own children. They should ensure that the elderly are cared for until the end of their lives, that the able-bodied are given work to do, that the young are cared for and nurtured, and that the widowed, the orphaned, the lonely, and the disabled are all looked after.”  To promote this, we must start with filial piety. Because with filial piety, people will not be selfish, and they will naturally consider the needs of others.

This is "transmitting the Way." We are sharing with everyone from the perspective of filial piety.  We have come to understand that as long as filial piety is implemented in education, family and social problems will gradually be resolved. If we put all the social problems in front of us, can’t we resolve them if people possess these twelve virtues?  If we are filial and respectful, will we still fight with our parents and siblings?  If we are loyal, will we betray our country? If we are trustworthy, will we still make and sell unsafe food?  If we practice propriety, will we still get into fights with people if they accidentally bump into us? If we have righteousness, will the divorce rate still be so high? Will people still betray each other for personal gain?  Have you ever been hurt? If people had righteousness, they would not harm others. It's because they are only focused on their own feelings and personal interests that they are likely to hurt others. If we are honest, so many problems can be resolved. If people had a sense of shame, then the social atmosphere will improve. With benevolence, love, and peace, a group will be harmonious.  So these twelve virtues are shining with light!  If we grasp the essence of all these moral principles, teaching children to be sensible is not complicated. Do we have the awareness, do we value it, and are we putting in the effort to implement filial piety and the eight virtues?

Next, is "imparting the profession." This is the transmission of the Tao, knowledge, and the skills for managing a family and a business. The *Great Learning*, one of the Four Books, states, “The way of great learning consists in manifesting one’s clear virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in perfect goodness.”  This is the "way of great learning" which is the teaching of the ability for a student's wisdom and virtue to constantly improve and reach perfection so that one can benefit others and help them achieve wisdom and virtue, and not to turn students into exam-taking machines. This sentence is worthy of deep reflection, because a machine has no emotion, does not remember kindness, and cannot understand or empathize with others.

Have you seen infants recently? Children of only a few months or a year or two? Their eyes are very clear and bright, yes? They are very spiritually aware. If you look at a college student, how does their eyes compare to a child's? Aren't their eyes more dim and lacking spirituality? Studying should make a person's spirit grow, it should help one become more spiritually aware. This is the right direction.  If we study in the right way, we will return to our original nature and become younger.  When you look at our teacher who has been studying in the right way, even at 87 years old, his eyes are bright, piercing, compassionate, and full of wisdom. This is the profession we should teach.

The *Great Learning* tells us, "When one knows where to focus, one can be steadfast. When one is steadfast, one can be calm. When one is calm, one can be at peace. When one is at peace, one can contemplate. When one contemplates, one can achieve."  What does this “achieve” mean? It means entering into the realm of sages and becoming wise, just like a sage.  So, the goal of imparting this profession is to open up perfect wisdom, this is the profession to teach. The *Standards for Students* says, “Do not give up on yourself, or abandon yourself. With effort, you can become a sage or a wise person.” If it weren’t possible for everyone to become a sage, then isn’t this a joke? Those who have achieved it know that everyone has an inherent goodness, an innate clear virtue, and it is definitely possible to recover it. Therefore, those who engage in education must have unwavering faith and not have the slightest doubt. "At the beginning of life, people are inherently good.” Only then can we use 100% confidence to trust students, to inspire their wisdom and goodness. This belief is very important.

"Knowing where to focus," means that students who are learning the way of the sages will stay focused on the "way of great learning."  First, they must establish their aspirations. Their value in life should be to manifest their clear virtue, love the people, and abide in perfect goodness. They should establish this aspiration. Has everyone established this?  If so, then every day your direction, your goals, and everything you do will not be separate from this goal. To "manifest your clear virtue," have your spirituality and wisdom improved a little each day? Or do you feel more and more confused, more and more lost? If so, then you are not in line with your goal. To "love the people", how have you benefited your family and friends while living in this world? This is loving the people.

If one has established these aspirations, one will not change, one will not hesitate, and one’s life will not always be without direction. After setting this aspiration, one will focus their mind on one thing, on this goal, with no distractions. Every day, one should focus on self-improvement and benefiting others. In this way, every day will be fulfilling. Before I started studying traditional culture, when I was in my teens and twenties, when I woke up in the morning on my day off, I would think, “What should I eat today? What movie should I go watch?”  I would just spend my days thinking about these types of pleasures, without knowing what meaning or value my life had.

So, if we focus our minds on one thing, we are always working towards this goal. Setting this aspiration is "steadfast." When the mind is free of distractions, that is "calm." Steadfastness and calmness. When the mind is free of distractions, we are able to be at peace in all circumstances, whether favorable or unfavorable. Why?  Because everyone and everything exists to help us grow, to help us understand our deficiencies. So we can find "peace." Everyone is our teacher. Everyone is here to help us see our own bad habits and improve. Therefore, everyone is a good person, and everything is a good thing. Our heart is at peace.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, while maintaining the tone of the original:

**Translation:**

When the mind is always at peace, with clear and present awareness, this indicates that the practice of concentration (定 - dìng) is deepening. Ultimately, this concentration gives rise to wisdom. As the saying goes, "Peace enables contemplation" (安而後能慮 - ān ér hòu néng lǜ). This "contemplation" (慮 - lǜ) refers to the emergence of wisdom, which brings understanding of the teachings and principles of sages, and ultimately the attainment of their enlightened state, which is "obtaining" (得 - dé).

However, this process of "concentration, stillness, peace, contemplation, and attainment" (定、靜、安、慮、得 - dìng, jìng, ān, lǜ, dé) is not merely intellectual knowledge. Therefore, when we teachers are engaged in transmitting the Way (傳道 - chuándào) and imparting knowledge (授業 - shòuyè), we must first deeply understand the classics ourselves, and then diligently put them into practice. For example, how do I practice filial piety towards my parents? How do I treat my siblings with brotherly affection? It’s absolutely not enough to simply lecture students on these principles; that won't educate them well.  Because the most crucial aspect of education is leading by example. Children can sense from our words and actions the extent to which we embody the principles we teach. The more we embody them, the more sincerely our actions flow, and the more easily we will resonate with our students. If our words are hollow, if we preach one thing and do another, it will be difficult to resonate or exert any influence. This is why the sages of the three traditions – Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Shakyamuni Buddha – have had such a profound and lasting impact on their students, both in their own time and in subsequent generations.  It's simply because they led by example; they spoke about what they had already achieved. This is what makes their influence so profound. This is the meaning of "imparting knowledge" (授業 - shòuyè).

Regarding family matters and careers (家業 - jiāyè and 事業 - shìyè), the *Great Learning* tells us, “Virtue is the root; wealth is the branch” (德者本也，財者末也 - dé zhě běn yě, cái zhě mò yě). Thus, virtue (德 - dé) is the foundation of both family and career. As a saying goes, “Virtue is the foundation of success” (德者，事業之基也 - dé zhě, shìyè zhī jī yě).  Virtue is to success what a foundation is to a building; there is no logic to the idea that a building could be sturdy and long-lasting if its foundation is unstable (未有基不固而棟宇堅久者 - wèi yǒu jī bù gù ér dòng yǔ jiān jiǔ zhě). Therefore, the transmission of knowledge (授業 - shòuyè) must also start from this fundamental principle.

"Resolving doubts" (解惑 - jiěhuò) means to resolve the doubts of others. However, to do this we must first resolve our own doubts. Only by awakening ourselves can we awaken others; only by saving ourselves can we save others. As the *Book of Documents* says, one must first awaken oneself to then awaken those who are yet to awaken (先覺才能覺後覺 - xiān jué cáinéng jué hòu jué). To resolve our own doubts, we must first be diligent in learning. Diligent learning brings wisdom. Diligent learning begins with cultivating the attitude of a disciple of the sages.  Only with this attitude of a disciple can we receive the teachings of the sages. It's like needing an empty vessel to fill it with something. Therefore, a student is often referred to as a "vessel of the Dharma" (法器 - fǎqì).  To be a vessel of the Dharma, one must be empty, which is to say, humble. If one is already full, it's very difficult to receive these good teachings.  So, a vessel of the Dharma represents what? It represents the attitude of a disciple, also known as possessing “the attributes of a disciple” (弟子相 - dìzǐ xiàng). Attitude determines success, it’s not that attitude changes after success is achieved.  This applies to both our careers and our studies. We must first possess a sincere and respectful attitude to learn the wisdom and knowledge from virtuous teachers; it's impossible to learn and then decide to change our attitude.

One aspect of a disciple’s attitude is “taking the initiative to ask for guidance” (主動請教 - zhǔdòng qǐngjiào). When teaching children, we say things like, "Children, ask questions! Do you have any questions?" We always tell children to ask questions proactively. In our work as teachers, educational authorities often mandate that we attend a certain number of training sessions, so during our breaks, we often have to go to courses. Usually, we stand on the platform and teach, but when we go to these training courses, we sit below while the professor or instructor asks, "Are there any questions? Raise your hand if you have a question.”  And we all just lower our heads. Sometimes I think about it – on the platform, I ask my students to ask questions proactively, but when I sit down below, I don't ask any questions myself. This shows that I'm not leading by example.

Therefore, if we want to carry on the tradition of the Way (道統 - dàotǒng), we must be good students of the sages and actively seek guidance, and actively ask questions. This is not just my requirement for everyone; it’s what *Standards for Students* says: "When you have doubts, take notes immediately. Then go ask for clarification and seek the true meaning." (心有疑，隨札記，就人問，求確義 - xīn yǒu yí, suí zhájì, jiù rén wèn, qiú què yì). You might ask, what if I don't have a teacher nearby? Then, "look for a way to succeed." We cannot just give up because we don't have the necessary conditions. We cannot. The sooner we gain wisdom, the sooner our students will benefit. A teacher with a loving heart will overcome all obstacles. We can find three or four good friends who study with the same teacher, as the classics say, “Learning from each other for good is called emulation" (相觀而善之謂摩 - xiāng guān ér shàn zhī wèi mó); "Studying alone without friends leads to narrowness and ignorance" (獨學而無友，則孤陋而寡聞 - dú xué ér wú yǒu, zé gū lòu ér guǎ wén).  When three or five like-minded friends discuss together, we can usually clarify our understanding, figuring out the correct interpretation of a teaching. If we still can’t understand, we can write down the question and ask for guidance by email.  For instance, if our teacher is in Hong Kong, we can ask him. We must find a way to succeed. There will always be a way. Or, during our group study sessions, we can write down our questions and discuss them together. Taking the initiative to ask for guidance is fundamental. You see, every time I give a lecture, my business is not good. No one brings up anything to discuss. There are only two possibilities: one is that everyone has already achieved complete enlightenment and has no questions. The second... well, think about it yourselves. Some things are best left unsaid. The truth is we teach children to do these things, but we ourselves haven’t done them yet.

“Taking the initiative to seek instructions" (主動請示 - zhǔdòng qǐngshì) means that when a child wants to do something, they won’t act on their own authority; rather, they’ll ask, “Teacher, is it okay if I do this? Is it good to do it this way?” They won't make a decision and then report it after the fact; that's asking for instructions beforehand. For example, "Teacher, is it okay if I read this book?" Because children are still inexperienced, they might read books in a disordered manner, or books with biased views. In this way, the teacher can protect the student. When learning to do something, they should also know to ask for guidance; this shows respect. With this attitude, the teacher’s knowledge, wisdom, and experience in life can be passed down to them. Those who always do things based on their own whims will not gain these benefits and will not receive the fruits of the teacher’s decades of study.

“Taking the initiative to report" (主動匯報 - zhǔdòng huìbào) and “taking the initiative to participate" (主動參與 - zhǔdòng cānyù). We can report our learning and insights to our teacher to see if our understanding is correct, so that if we have made a mistake, it can be immediately corrected. Or, three or five friends can share their learning experiences, supporting and reminding each other. If we understand something incorrectly, our path of learning can easily become further and further off course, as they say, "A small deviation in the beginning will lead to a huge difference in the end” (差之毫釐，謬以千里 - chā zhī háolí, miù yǐ qiānlǐ). Furthermore, taking the initiative to participate means setting a good example and inspiring others in the learning process.  All of this concerns resolving the doubts of others; first we must have wisdom ourselves. And to gain wisdom, we must first have the attitude of a disciple of the sages, in order to receive their good teachings.

When a teacher truly finds joy in simple living and embraces the Way (安貧樂道 - ānpín lèdào), it's because we understand our role in transmitting the Way, imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts (傳道、授業、解惑 - chuándào, shòuyè, jiěhuò). When we truly devote ourselves to understanding the classics, we naturally experience the joy of the Dharma.  In fact, when you hear the phrase “finding joy in simple living and embracing the Way,” is it something you find happy and inspiring or do you feel uncomfortable? Some may think, “Who says teachers have to be poor?” The point is not that teachers are poor, but that people who truly delve into the classics are very focused. They don't have time to think about which coffee shop has the best coffee. Those who are truly devoted, don't even have time to clip their nails; they sometimes forget such things. As Confucius said, they "become so engrossed in study that they forget to eat and find joy so they forget their worries" (發憤忘食，樂以忘憂 - fāfèn wàng shí, lè yǐ wàng yōu).  Confucius was so focused when drinking soup that he saw the image of Yu the Great on the wall above where the soup was originally from; when he went to Qi and heard the Shao music, he “lost all taste for meat for three months" (三月不知肉味 - sān yuè bù zhī ròu wèi).  He was completely focused and did not become distracted. Thus, Confucius could "eat simple food, drink plain water, and use his arm as a pillow" (飯疏食飲水，曲肱而枕之 - fàn shū shí yǐn shuǐ, qū gōng ér zhěn zhī) while still finding joy (樂亦在其中矣 - lè yì zài qí zhōng yǐ). Why? Because true joy comes from within, from the act of helping others. "To have the best talents of the world taught by me" (得天下英才而教之 - dé tiānxià yīngcái ér jiào zhī) and seeing these students constantly improve brings great happiness.

People nowadays have misunderstood this. They think joy comes from external stimulation. This causes teachers to constantly want to make more money, which is why they cannot find joy in simple living and embrace the Way. Confucius also praised his disciple Yan Hui, "He had a single bamboo basket of rice and a single gourd of drink, and lived in a poor lane, which most people would not be able to endure, but Yan Hui did not change his happiness" (一簞食，一瓢飲，在陋巷，人不堪其憂，回也不改其樂 - yī dān shí, yī piáo yǐn, zài lòuxiàng, rén bù kān qí yōu, huí yě bù gǎi qí lè). I'm not saying this to suggest we should all live a life of hardship, but rather to help us experience the state of mind of Confucius and Yan Hui. Actually, in our current education system, the country has already taken good care of us; we should no longer be worried about our living situation.  We should know our role and what we should prioritize in our hearts: to cultivate the next generation for our country.

Alright, that’s all for this lesson. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and fluency while maintaining the original meaning and tone.

**Lecture 10: The Dignity of Teachers: Part 3, Revitalizing the Teaching Profession; A Model for Educators - The Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius: Part 1, Confucius' Approach to Learning**

Respected elders, fellow educators, and esteemed colleagues, good afternoon to you all!

We've just finished discussing the third point of "Revitalizing the Teaching Profession," which is knowing one's duties: to impart the Way, transmit knowledge, and resolve doubts. The fourth point was embracing a life of simplicity and finding joy in the Way, cultivating talent for the nation. We need to understand that "it takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." The cultivation of a student requires considerable effort and dedication. Therefore, only by finding joy in a simple life can one truly nurture talent for the nation. This “simplicity” doesn't mean being impoverished; it refers to a life free from material desires. One's life goal is not personal pleasure or accumulating wealth, but rather a focused and undivided commitment to nurturing talent for the country. Teachers aim to improve together with their students. As it's said, “Only after studying do we realize our inadequacies.” Especially in our time, many of us only began learning about Chinese culture in adulthood, so we ourselves have many shortcomings. Thus, “Only after studying do we realize our inadequacies, and only after teaching do we realize our difficulties." When guiding children in principles of conduct, we may find ourselves faltering because we haven’t fully grasped the meaning. We must then quickly return to the classics, thoroughly studying the deep meanings found in the writings of ancient and contemporary scholars, and then applying these principles to other contexts. "Knowing our inadequacies allows us to reflect on ourselves; knowing our difficulties allows us to strive for self-improvement." We must constantly reflect and constantly strive for self-improvement. Even 24 hours in a day isn't enough! Where would there be time to constantly go out for fancy meals or buy designer clothes? I believe it’s difficult to elevate one's virtue and wisdom under such circumstances. This is why for thousands of years, teachers have embraced simplicity and found joy in the Way; there is a reason for it. And the joy they experience is a personal knowing, "like a person drinking water, only they know whether it is hot or cold.” Our Master (Confucius) was someone who "forgot to eat when he was engrossed in study, and forgot his worries in his joy." This was because he was "never tired of learning and never weary of teaching." Being never tired of learning, he had wisdom. Never weary of teaching, he had benevolence and compassion. He was always thinking about benefiting his students and nurturing future generations for the nation. A person with wisdom and virtue experiences joy that comes from within.

Let's consider this from another perspective. If teachers were all driving BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes, how would their students feel? How could teachers make so much money? If the students are attracted by the teacher’s brand names, cars, and money, how can the students turn to the Way? How can they respect their teachers? In the past, teachers embraced simplicity and nurtured talent for the nation. If we no longer uphold this spirit now, we will be chasing after fame and fortune, and this spirit will be replaced by this pursuit. Hence, there is a saying nowadays that schools have become businesses, and some university professors are called "boss" by their students. This trend cannot continue! If teachers chase after fame and fortune, they will ultimately fail to cultivate talent for the nation. Instead, they may mislead their students and damage the nation's young sprouts. This is something we need to consider deeply. Because when pursuing fame and fortune, one's desire for them will grow stronger and one will lose sight of the children's inner world.

For example, when comparing grades, teachers may use harsh words to hurt students with poorer grades. This is seeking fame. Some teachers might even put those with lower grades at the back of the class or ask them to transfer schools. Isn't this damaging the nation's young sprouts? Why? Because children respect their parents and teachers the most, and when teachers treat them this way, it causes immense pain. Some pursue fame, and others seek profit. If a student's family does not send gifts, they will be targeted. Teachers are the engineers of the human soul. How can they harm a person's soul for fame and profit? Therefore, if teachers are not respected, we must reflect on whether our own words and actions are aligned with the ethics of teaching.

I once met a young student who recounted her schooling experience. Because her teacher was pursuing fame and profit, she was deeply rejected. I could see her trembling as she spoke. The shadow of this incident, even after ten or twenty years, had not faded away. This had caused severe obstacles to her personal growth, and we have truly failed to live up to the title of "teacher.”

Of course, what if we, our students, or our loved ones have been hurt by teachers during their education? How should we respond? We need to guide them. Teachers originally entered the field of education with a heart of compassion, but they have been influenced by the utilitarianism of society. So, the situation of teachers today reminds us that when we become teachers in the future, we must not repeat these mistakes. We must let go of fame and profit and demonstrate sacrifice and dedication so that the spirit and ethics of teaching can be restored in us. Then, the life lesson that teacher gave you will be very valuable. We must change our perspective. If we remain in the place of hurt, we are also hurting ourselves. Shift this into a mission. Transform crisis into opportunity, and transform troubles into wisdom and a sense of mission. This is transforming our perspective. The difference between a sage and a madman lies in a single thought. Is one’s mind blocked by troubles or is it transformed into wisdom and a sense of mission, enabling one to elevate oneself and benefit others? The choice lies in a single thought.

Furthermore, not only should we care for students, but teachers also entered the field of education with a mission. Now that they are influenced by the social atmosphere, we should also reciprocate to the teachers. Even though teachers may have shortcomings, they have also been kind to us. We must remember the saying, "Gratitude should be repaid, and grudges should be forgotten.” If resentment remains in our hearts, we will be miserable and unhappy, we will have nightmares and we will not be loving ourselves. Moreover, if one is frequently unhappy and has nightmares, do our parents know? Can they feel it? Yes, they can. So, if we don’t take care of ourselves, it is actually an act of unfilial piety. So, we must learn to let go of troubles. Our parents are very perceptive; they will worry about us, even if they don't fully understand our inner turmoil. For our parents’ sake, we should let go of all our troubles and change our perspective.

Regarding the teacher who has hurt you, you should benefit their lives and reawaken their loving heart for education. When you return to your hometown, bring gifts to visit your teacher. I think they will be surprised, “Oh, why are they here to see me?” Right? Why? People have a conscience. They know that they have treated a student poorly, and when they are calm, they will feel that what they did was wrong, but they may be too embarrassed to admit it. Not only do you harbor no resentment, you go to visit them, recalling their past kindness. They will be touched and ashamed. Furthermore, you can give them the *Standards for Being a Good Student* and books about traditional culture, along with video recordings and books about the inspiring examples of educators like Teacher Wang Qi and Principal Lu Jie. From our own behavior, they can also see that those who learn traditional culture are very tolerant. "I treated this student so poorly, yet they don’t hold it against me. They're even offering me good things and saying, 'Teacher, your son is going to college, right? This set of video recordings would be very good for him.'" You show care for him and his family, and the connection will be transformed. If this teacher does not change, their future negative karma will be enormous and they may ruin the future wisdom of many children by continuing to pursue fame and profit. We must show compassion and help them understand our ancestors’ teachings. Every encounter has a karmic connection, and we should try to make every connection perfect, free of conflict, regret, and harm.

It is our responsibility to cultivate talent for the nation. In ancient times, officials wore hats called *jin xian mao* (hats to recommend the virtuous), which shows the wisdom in even the design of hats. The front is low, and the back is high, signifying the hope that students will surpass their teachers, just as blue dye comes from the indigo plant, but is bluer than the plant itself. In ancient times, when a person achieved success, the first thing they would do upon returning to their hometown was to pay respects to their ancestors to acknowledge the source of their blessings, and then they would thank their teachers. Look how filial piety and respect for teachers are completely embodied in the actions of a person who has achieved success and returned home. Because people usually studied in private schools near their homes, the moral foundation they established was often laid by these private school teachers. When we reflect on the traditions passed down for thousands of years, we can see that they have a profound and far-reaching significance.

The fifth point for revitalizing the teaching profession is self-improvement. In the *Han Shi Wai Zhuan,* it says a teacher should be someone whose "wisdom is like a spring, and whose conduct is a model.” This is a very good standard for a teacher. In the late Eastern Han dynasty, there was a boy named Wei Zhao. Though just a boy, he knew to seek out wise teachers. There was a scholar named Guo Linzong, who was very virtuous and knowledgeable. Wei Zhao took the initiative to learn from him. Guo Linzong asked him why he insisted on learning from him. He said a famous quote, spoken by a boy, "It is easy to find a *jing shi* (teacher of classics), but difficult to find a *ren shi* (teacher who is a role model)." A *jing shi* is very knowledgeable and understands the meaning of a particular classic. This is knowledge. But a *ren shi* not only has knowledge, but also great virtue. Just like the standard mentioned earlier: "Wisdom is like a spring," a continuous flow of pure water. "Conduct is a model," meaning their words and actions inspire students' virtues. The entire goal of a teacher is to continuously elevate their wisdom and virtue. Inspired by the words of the boy Wei Zhao, we should strive to become role model teachers, to be *ren shi*.

How do we acquire wisdom? *The Doctrine of the Mean* tells us that “being fond of learning is akin to wisdom.” What does being fond of learning mean? It means learning without weariness, without interruption, only then can one have wisdom. “If you don’t read for three days, your face will become repulsive.” A colleague said that now, if you don’t read for three hours, your face will become repulsive! He's better than me. I don't need three hours; just one hour without reading and my mind will become full of delusions, evil thoughts, and distracting thoughts. Thus, wisdom requires constant and diligent effort. Being diligent means not being distracted, and advancing means not stopping. It's like drilling for fire. If you can drill out fire, then that fire represents wisdom. How can you drill fire out? You have to keep drilling and drilling, continuously, and the fire will come. If you drill once, then stop because your arm is sore, take a 30-second break, then drill again, tell me, when will the fire come? You can't drill fire this way.

This is why Confucius said, “Never be tired of learning.” One cannot be weary. If you become weary, you stop, and all the previous efforts are wasted. Thus, Teacher Li Bingnan said that when people learn traditional culture, if they go see a movie after studying for a week, it all goes to waste. This is why the *Standards for Being a Good Student* reminds us, “Do not watch books that are not of the sages, as this will cloud your intelligence and corrupt your heart." Even if you cannot control your temper and cannot recall the teachings of the classics in that moment, if you lose your temper, it’s like burning down a forest of merit; all your efforts in learning will be reduced to nothing. We will delve into Confucius' model of “being fond of learning” later.

“Conduct is a model,” meaning one’s virtue serves as a role model for students and others. Having such good virtue comes from aligning understanding with practice. Once you understand the meaning, you must then work hard to implement it. For example, if you understand the importance of filial piety, you learn one sentence and put it into practice. With each action, your virtue and state of mind are elevated. With the elevation, you will understand the meaning more deeply, and with a deeper understanding, you will put it into practice more thoroughly. In this way, wisdom and virtue will surely be elevated through aligning understanding with practice. If one’s actions are not recognized by others, it is because understanding and practice are not aligned. Therefore, *Standards for Being a Good Student* reminds us, "If you don't diligently practice, and only study the text, your growth will be superficial." If there is understanding without practice, what will happen? "You will grow in superficiality." Not only will you fail to be a role model for others, they will not agree with you. "You will grow in superficiality, what kind of person will you become?” I hear many people say, "My husband puts a lot of pressure on me by making demands after he learns." Isn't that arrogant? "If you diligently practice without learning the text," if you don't deepen your understanding of the classics and don't listen to explanations from teachers, “you will be stubborn and ignorant of true principles.” In this situation, you will be putting things into practice but without understanding the meaning, and therefore will be misinterpreting and implementing things incorrectly. This is why aligning understanding and practice is so important.

In fact, if we want to truly elevate our virtue, we just need to learn one sentence and keep it in mind all the time; we will be able to feel our virtue being elevated. For example, if we all implement the sentence “Always think of the other person, always think of others” together, and then share our experiences next week, we will have insights after just one week if we continuously implement it. By diligently doing it for one or two weeks, your relatives and friends may tell you, "I think you have changed recently." Others see that we have changed; this shows "conduct is a model.”

If we calmly observe ourselves, although we have been learning for so many years, which sentence in *Standards for Being a Good Student* have we completely put into practice? Our practice is still so lacking. So, during this time, we should focus completely on implementing that one sentence. Let me tell you, this study is very meaningful; it is not simply learning knowledge, or just learning one thing and being able to do it according to a standard answer. Our learning is of the heart and mind; it touches on everything. If you truly implement one or two sentences in *Standards for Being a Good Student*, you will be able to implement the other sentences. Why? When you implement one sentence, your filial piety is awakened, then others will be easily implemented. When you implement one sentence, your respect emerges, then other things become easy. If you work on this sentence today, then try another one tomorrow, then you will not have firmly put a single sentence into practice.

Therefore, in self-improvement, especially in wisdom, we can "review the old and learn the new, and thereby be fit to be a teacher." "Learning through memorization is not enough to be a teacher." If one can continuously improve one’s ability to understand and one’s wisdom, "review the old and learn the new," one's understanding of principles will become deeper and wider, and the classics and ancient teachings will be fully understood, then one will be able to apply them in how they treat others and in how they interact with the world. Then, as this person gets older, they will become more and more well-liked and more and more wise. If people don't learn sage and virtuous education in this day and age, they may become more and more unconfident and more and more troubled as they age. All right, that's the fifth point for revitalizing the teaching profession that I wanted to share with everyone.

Now, let's discuss the sixth point: We have already committed to revitalizing the dignity of teachers within ourselves. Where should we start? We should learn from the excellent example of the Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius. We can learn how he learned and how he taught. We can gain a great many insights from his entire life. So, the sixth point is: A Model for Educators - The Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius. The first main point is: Confucius’ approach to learning. Whether this approach is based on Confucius’ own words or his students’ sharing, I believe that his students’ sharing also comes from inheriting Confucius' teachings, and so it is included in what we should learn.

Firstly, Confucius said of his own learning, “I transmit but do not create; I believe in and love the ancient ways.” All of the classics and teachings that Confucius spoke of were those that the ancient sages and worthies had taught him; he didn't create any of them himself. This is humility. People in this day and age often feel that they themselves are the ones who discovered these principles. In fact, if we look at today's educational theories, which often mention preventative methods, timely methods, step-by-step methods, and observational methods, these methods are often said to be theories of such-and-such person. However, these methods have all been recorded in our classics from thousands of years ago.

For example, in the “Record of Learning” in the *Book of Rites*, it says, "To prevent something before it manifests is called preventative." Confucius also taught, "A gentleman has three things to guard against. When young, when one's vital energy is unstable, one must guard against lust." These are all preventative measures, reminders for everyone.

"To do what is appropriate is called timely." When a student made a mistake, Confucius did not immediately correct them. Confucius showed these things, and these theories are all in the classics.

“Do not progress in a way that is out of order.” This is a step-by-step method. Thus, Confucius said, “I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn; I do not reveal until they are at the point of struggling to express themselves. If, after I have pointed out one corner of a subject, they do not return with the other three, I shall not repeat myself.” This means that the student is not yet actively eager to delve deeply into learning; that the time is not yet right. If you teach them too much, they won't be receptive and they'll find it annoying. You must progress in steps, not rush. "I do not reveal until they are at the point of struggling to express themselves." This “struggling to express” means the student has some understanding but is struggling to express it and wants to share it with you. When Confucius recognized that, he actively guided and enlightened them. “Yes, yes, yes,” and so teacher and student would connect. However, if the student has not yet reached this attitude, Confucius wouldn’t be impatient. “If, after I have pointed out one corner of a subject,” like one corner of a building, "they do not return with the other three," which means the student has not yet understood. It's all right; there is no need to rush. Otherwise, forcibly stuffing them with knowledge will block their potential for understanding. If they can’t come back with the other three corners, “I shall not repeat myself.”

For example, when we are talking with students, as you talk, you see that they are barely keeping their eyes open. Although they are nodding, their eyes are telling you, “I don't understand, I don’t understand.” This is real; they are trying hard, but you can see in their eyes that it's not the kind of eyes you see when someone understands. When a person understands, their eyes become bright, they become more and more eager to listen. This is the opportunity; you should follow the situation and continue to guide, and maybe they'll come to an understanding. But if you are speaking to them and their eyes become more and more lifeless, then you should not rush, and follow the step-by-step approach.

"Observing each other to improve" is called imitation. When Confucius praised Yan Hui, he caused other students to learn from him. Confucius showed all these methods in his actions.

Our ancestors spoke of all these methods thousands of years ago. Yet so many of the world's experts and scholars today haven't read our ancient books, and say, "I invented this, I invented that." What they invented might be correct, but other things that they come up with may not be. They become more and more confident in their own views, which is very dangerous. The truths and good words of the world have all been spoken by the sages and ancestors. When you have a new thought, you must compare it with the classics to know if it's correct. So, why is it that with so many educational theories today, the next generation is being taught so poorly? There are even studies being done on dogs, cats, and mice! Our ancestors never taught us to do this.

So, Confucius' attitude is very important. “I transmit but do not create,” meaning he did not create or invent anything of his own, but completely followed the classics. When a person has this attitude, they are humble, and with humility, there is receptiveness. “Pride invites loss, while humility receives benefit.” “I believe in and love the ancient ways,” meaning they did not doubt the ancients; they had great confidence. “Loving the ancient ways” means they studied very diligently. In the "Narrating" chapter, in *The Analects*, Confucius said that he “Loved the ancient ways and diligently sought after them.” Both sentences are in the “Narrating” chapter, making it easy to look up. Respecting the teachings of the ancients, “diligently” means taking initiative and actively studying. For example, when Confucius went to the Zhou emperor's jurisdiction, he asked Laozi about the rites. He never let any opportunity to learn go by. Similarly, when he heard the Shao music in the state of Qi, Confucius thought it was a wonderful form of music education and immediately went to study and inherit it. “Diligently sought after them.”

The second attitude in learning is having aspirations. Confucius said, "At fifteen, my mind was set on learning.” This is in the second chapter, “Governing,” in *The Analects*. "At thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the mandate of Heaven; at sixty, my ears were attuned; and at seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without overstepping the boundaries." There are many meanings in these words. First, when learning, one must first set aspirations. Then, one must constantly elevate one’s own state. One cannot be content with knowing just a little, nor can one become weary after learning for a long time. The "standing firm" means that when facing adversity, one does not retreat, and when facing favorable circumstances, one does not become attached. Moreover, “my mind was set on learning” means learning what? It is to learn the knowledge of cultivating oneself, harmonizing one’s family, governing the state, and pacifying the world, and learning to illuminate virtue, to love the people, and to stop at the ultimate good. He set his mind on this at the age of fifteen. What should we reflect on when we see this? “Oh, I didn’t start learning until I was thirty.” What does that mean? It means we must learn even more diligently than Confucius did, in order to catch up.

"At thirty, I stood firm." It means one is not tempted by any situation and stands firm on moral principles. “At forty, I had no doubts.” This means that in all circumstances, he has no attachments or aversions. He can flexibly apply his learning depending on the person, event, or situation. It means he is able to skillfully adapt. Do you have a feeling like this? When facing situations, we don't know which is the right way to handle it and have no control over it. It feels like there is reason to do this, but there's also reason to do that, and we end up wavering. This “doubts” does not mean confusion; it means one knows very clearly which teaching to follow in each circumstance, and there is no hesitation.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and accurate rendition in English:

**Title: Understanding Our Mandate and the Path of Learning**

"At fifty, one knows the mandate of heaven," which means understanding the mission we have in this lifetime concerning our entire national culture. We can extend this concept to our own lives, clarifying what our mission is towards our family, our mission to the field of education, our mission towards the entire Chinese nation, and even our mission to the world. In particular, we, the Chinese of Malaysia, should take on the mission of introducing Chinese culture to Western society. Because when one place in the world is in turmoil, other places are affected. We must have this breadth of vision, and indeed, Chinese culture is a global treasure.

There was a girl from Russia who came to listen to our classes. A senior student translated for her, and she enjoyed listening very much. She said that every time after listening to a class on traditional culture, her heart felt at peace for three days. People of different ethnicities can also benefit and rejoice from it. Also, a head of state from a certain country sent a minister to Malaysia to obtain the English version of the *Selected Writings from the Classics, 360*. Therefore, translating traditional culture into English is the responsibility of the Chinese people of Malaysia. Agreed? It is not enough to just obtain it; we also need to propagate it. This is something I cannot do myself, as my English is very poor. This is what it means to know one's mandate from heaven.

The twenty-first century is the century of Chinese culture. Every child of the Chinese nation should understand this mandate. Confucius understood his mandate, and therefore did not waste his life. He did not let down Heaven's expectations of him. Observe how the Master had no fear in times of crisis, proclaiming, "Heaven has not yet abandoned these cultural teachings," signifying that Heaven intended for the lineage of Chinese culture to be passed down. “What can the people of Kuang do to me?" The Chief Minister Huan Tui of Song couldn't harm him at all. Indeed, the Master passed through these dangers safely. This suggests that those who vow to carry on Chinese culture can turn misfortune into blessing. We can even extend this to say that, not only can they turn misfortune into blessing, but they can also prolong their lives. Do you not believe me? Look at our revered teacher, who was originally supposed to live only until forty-five. See how he devoted himself to the well-being of the world, bearing the entire lineage of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism on his shoulders. This year, he is eighty-seven years old, having prolonged his life by over forty years, and is still so healthy. Isn't this the best example for us to follow? With such a good role model, we can have confidence, and then emulate him. "What was Shun? What am I? Those who act can also become like him."

"At sixty, one's ear is attuned," and "At seventy, one can follow the desires of the heart without transgressing the boundaries." These are stages of reaching a profound understanding. "Ear is attuned" means that upon hearing the classics, one completely comprehends the principles, and upon hearing others speak, one immediately understands their intentions. This is a state of realization. "At seventy, one can follow the desires of the heart" means that every thought, word, and deed does not deviate from the Way.

The third aspect of learning is entirely about diligence in study. In the section "Gongye Chang, Fifth," it is stated, "Even in a village of ten households, there will surely be those who are as loyal and sincere as I, but none who love learning as much as I do.” The Master was saying that in a place where ten families reside, there will definitely be people whose inherent qualities, such as loyalty and sincerity, are about the same as his. We respect the Master, therefore, we don't call him by his given name "Qiu" directly; we just call him "someone", saying, "None who love learning as much as 'someone'." Thus, the Master emphasizes that although a person may have good inherent qualities, they must also make diligent efforts in their studies to achieve great accomplishments and knowledge.

Where is this love of learning manifested? In "Zihan, Ninth," it says that to love learning, most importantly, one must be persistent. "Zihan, Ninth" states: “It is like making a mountain; if one stops for the lack of one basketful of earth, I stop where I have stopped. It is like leveling the ground; though one has only poured a single basketful, if one continues forward, I continue forward.” The Master used an analogy. If today you are building a mountain, and only need one more basket of soil to finish it, but you stop, then all your previous efforts are wasted. Thus, perseverance is the foundation of success, and persistence is the essence of a love for learning. On the washbasin of Tang, the founder of the Shang Dynasty, there was an inscription: "If one can renovate oneself for a day, let him do so day by day. Yea, let him do so continuously.” "If one can renovate oneself for a day" means that one is determined to study. "If one" is setting the intention to be a sage; this is "renovate oneself for a day." As we mentioned earlier, "At fifteen, I set my mind on learning" this is "renovate oneself for a day." "Let him do so day by day" means one should never be complacent; one must improve daily. “Yea, let him do so continuously” means never give up. These words of the ancients highlight the important attitude for learning. Therefore, the Master used an analogy: it’s like leveling the ground. Even if you have only poured one basket of earth, as long as you persevere, one day you will level it. There is an ancient fable called “Yu Gong Removes the Mountains.” The most important thing is perseverance. "If a person sincerely seeks the Way, diligently without cease, he will surely attain the fruit of his efforts." There is nothing in the world that is difficult; what is difficult is to have a determined mind.

Furthermore, in “Yong Ye, Sixth,” it states, "To know it is not as good as to love it; to love it is not as good as to delight in it.” To be tireless, delighted in it, this state of loving to learn is naturally different. Let's compare ourselves now: are we those who know, those who love, or those who delight in it? Those who know, know the fact; those who love, know the reason why; those who delight in it, after knowing the reason why, they continuously go deeper, put it into practice, and are tireless in their pursuit. For example, the greatest joy is doing good. Why is doing good joyful? Because when doing good, we are in harmony with our inherent virtues. Therefore, true joy comes from within. Once we understand this, and actually put it into practice, the more we do, the more joyful we become. We see many people around us volunteering. The more they do, the more they feel their hearts expand, the more they understand the sufferings of the masses, and the more they feel that life is meaningful. This is what it means to be delighted in it when one does good.

The fourth important attitude for learning, as we actually mentioned earlier, is to be proactive. This is stated in the *Analects*, “Fifteenth Book,” “If one does not say ‘What should I do? What should I do?’, I can indeed do nothing about such a person.”  "What should I do?" means to ask what to do. If a person encounters challenges and does not ponder what to do, how to solve them, or how to break through, "what should I do, what should I do," which means he is actively trying to come up with a solution, and this person does not have this attitude, then "I can indeed do nothing about such a person". If a person does not proactively take responsibility for solving problems, it is difficult for others to help them. As they say, "Heaven helps those who help themselves, Heaven saves those who save themselves; Heaven abandons those who abandon themselves." If you give up on yourself, if you do not actively seek learning, or if you don't actively look for methods, then it will be very difficult for others to help you or to make a difference in your situation. There is a saying: "A clay that cannot be molded into shape". So, the Master could only lament and say that he could do nothing about such a person. This kind of attitude easily leads to self-pity. “There is no solution, I’m beyond saving.”

Therefore, how much others can help us is directly proportional to our attitude. For example, Mencius, he learned from Confucius. Confucius had already passed away, but his attitude toward learning was one of utmost sincerity and respect, and therefore, he learned even better than the disciples whom Confucius directly taught. Our success is directly proportional to our sincerity and respect. Therefore, the ancients said "reflect on oneself". This can be verified in many situations. The above mentioned attitude is to be proactive.

The fifth attitude is not to deceive oneself. Confucius said to Zi Lu, using his name "You, do you know what I mean when I say, 'To know what you know, and to know that you do not know what you do not know, this is true knowledge?'" This attitude for learning means that if you know something, you say you know it; if you don't know, do not pretend you do. That way, the teacher will know how to guide us. So, “this is true knowledge.” This is a very important attitude for learning; only in this way can one be a wise person. One must be honest and not deceive oneself when facing their teacher; only then can one be correct in their learning.

There is a saying: "To feign knowledge where there is none", pretending to know when you do not know, "this is utter foolishness". "To create problems where there are none" when there were no problems in the family or in the group, we create gossip, and we stir up trouble; "To create problems where there are none, this is a sign of lacking blessings." These two sayings provide good insights into how we should learn and behave. Because when you speak improperly, saying things that aren't true, sometimes things can be made into a problem that was not previously there and small issues can blow up into big ones.

The sixth attitude for learning is to investigate things thoroughly. This point is very important because in *The Great Learning*, it states: “The ancients who wished to manifest their clear virtue to the world first governed their states. Those who wished to govern their states first put their families in order. Those who wished to put their families in order first cultivated their personal lives,” the core of all this is focusing on the root,  “Those who wished to cultivate their personal lives first rectified their hearts. Those who wished to rectify their hearts first made their wills sincere. Those who wished to make their wills sincere first extended their knowledge. The extension of knowledge consists in the investigation of things.” Thus, to investigate things thoroughly is the great root and foundation, which means to eliminate material desires.

Therefore, the Master in "Li Ren, Fourth," said: “The gentleman seeks neither satisfaction of his appetite nor comfort in his lodging; he is earnest in his duties and careful in his speech. Those who seek guidance from a virtuous person may be said to love learning.” This means that one’s desire for material things should be reduced, otherwise the whole spirit will be pursuing material pleasure. “Desire makes wisdom hazy, while profit makes wisdom confused.” Furthermore, "Desire is like an abyss"; therefore, it is impossible to achieve great success. Thus, "seek neither satisfaction of his appetite nor comfort in his lodging" does not mean that you should starve yourself or live in a broken down house. It means to have just enough for your needs. Even better, to live a simple and frugal life and take hardship as your teacher. In another saying, it is said that if a scholar "aspires to the Way", but is "ashamed of coarse clothing and poor food", complaining about not having good food, or feeling embarrassed for not wearing branded clothes, then such a person cannot practice the Way because he is too strong in his vanity and pursuit of pleasure. "He is not worth talking about".

After reading this, we think of Madam Xu Zhe. She said that her clothes are all picked up from the trash. The economy in Singapore is doing very well, so clothes are discarded after they go out of style. Do you wear them? You do, good. These next few days, maybe you should find a discarded piece of clothing to wear. It's such a waste if you don't. For example, if there are clothes in your unit that no one claims, you can claim it yourself, which is a way to practice the Way. Don't waste anything. Just wash it clean, right? You wear clothes that others have worn. First, you wash it clean; second, it helps you to deal with the mind of likes and dislikes, love and hate, which are serious attachments. As long as it is clean, there is no like or dislike, and you have elevated yourself. Is eating a way to practice the Way? By letting go of your likes and dislikes, and accepting everything, you will advance in your cultivation. *The Standards for Being a Good Student* says, “With food and drink, do not be picky,” this rule is also a way to practice the Way, letting go of the heart of likes and dislikes, love and hate. We can let go from the things we eat, wear, our living situation, and our daily actions.

Next, the seventh attitude for learning is the importance of putting what you learn into practice. After you learn, you must immediately put it into action. The Master had such a style, and that is how he had such high achievements. In "Shu Er, Seventh," the Master said, "My worry is that virtue is not cultivated, learning is not delved into, when one hears about what is righteous they cannot practice it, and when one is aware of wrongdoing, they cannot correct it." This means, are we improving our own moral conduct every day, and are we rectifying ourselves? Then, of the teachings we have studied, are we "delving into" them, and after learning them are we applying what we have learned in our daily work and interactions, and are we fully comprehending these teachings?

"When one hears about what is righteous, they cannot practice it.” When we hear of something just and righteous, do we immediately rush to do it? For example, when our entire culture faces the risk of perishing, are we able to put aside our leisurely lives and make more effort to pass on our culture? This is "When one hears about what is righteous, they are able to practice it". You can see how the Master put this principle into practice very thoroughly. Look how the Master, in order for the world to become stable, left his home of Lu and traveled throughout the various states for fourteen years, in order to bring the Way to others. He would use a demonstration site in whichever state that was willing to use his teachings, where the Zhou Dynasty rules would be put into action. This would serve as an example for all the world, and when people had confidence, they would all come to learn. At that time, no ruler used Confucius, which also signifies that the blessings of the world were insufficient. However, the Master tirelessly traveled throughout the states for fourteen years.

Including in our organizations, perhaps those who are in leadership roles. It is really not easy to be a leader these days. Why? Because they are managing so many people, and their foundation in conduct and behavior is not very strong. Therefore, leaders have to spend a lot of energy on communicating, coordinating, and advising. If there is a task that no one is willing to do, at this time, if you actively take on the responsibility to help lighten the burden for your leaders, this is also an example of “when one hears about what is righteous, one is able to practice it”. Will you suffer a loss? It seems you have never done such things, right? When you give, there will be a gain. The bigger the sacrifice, the bigger the gain. It is very possible that you take on what others see as a loss or a hardship, but it may actually turn out to be something good. Everyone can feel this in your future life. Even if people owe you, Heaven will repay you.

When you discover your own shortcomings, you must immediately correct them. This is the area where the Master was concerned about his own inadequacies and where he worked hard, thus, he had a very strong will to act. What are we concerned about everyday? Compare it to the Master. "Today's meal was not very good," "The way that person looked at me today was not very nice, how could they treat me like that?" "That person spoke badly about me today, how could they not trust me?" We are concerned about these things, and thus we waste a lot of energy. The Master is focused on moral conduct and learning, working on improving these areas. This is the will to put one's learning into practice.

The eighth attitude for learning is that we must learn diligently, but we must also diligently contemplate the underlying principles. We must be able to integrate those principles, and then apply them to our work, daily life and interactions. Because the Master said, “Learning without thinking is futile; thinking without learning is perilous.” This quote is in “Wei Zheng, Second Book”. After learning from the classics, we need to contemplate the underlying principles. This is called "understanding the profound meanings." For example, how should we practice filial piety? If we have contemplated this, then we will think of implementing it in nourishing our parents' bodies, minds, and ambitions and wisdom. Through this kind of contemplation, we will know where to start. Therefore, in these times, after we have learned, we need to also listen to those who have applied their learning, and this is how we understand the profound meanings and how to put them into practice. Otherwise, when you learn but don't contemplate these teachings, then the learning just becomes knowledge, not a practical way of life. Thus, “futile” means being lost and not gaining anything. Even after learning but not contemplating, we might feel that these teachings are not useful. Then, if one has this thought, thinking that the teachings of sages are useless, there is a possibility they may misunderstand the teachings of sages, and even slander them. This is not good at all. "If there is no one to explain the teachings of sages, even the wisest cannot understand." So, if we listen more to those who have applied their learning, then we can understand the meanings of the teachings and see their connections.

Since one does not gain anything, and regards the teachings as only knowledge, they are unable to apply their learning. Or if they apply them incorrectly, they may become more and more attached. For example, when we study traditional culture, and then instead of bringing joy to those around us we create pressure on them, this is an example of "learning without thinking". What we are doing is contradictory to the spirit and teachings of the classics, and thus, we have applied our learning incorrectly, which creates the phenomenon of becoming more and more attached. So, are we becoming more and more attached to our own views? We can look at the people around us. If after we have been learning, the people around us are laughing less, and sighing more, feeling helpless, we need to adjust ourselves.

For example, we often say "think of others in every thought," we have all likely heard this before. After hearing this, have we thought about how to put it into practice? If not, then it’s just knowledge. When interacting with others, we are still not considerate of others. For example, we are learning and living together, and we walk very loudly, and not paying attention, we often wake others up. Thus, we are not thinking of others in every thought. If someone were to contemplate, they would know that their words, actions, and conduct, should not create obstacles for others. We should always be considerate of others.  This kind of "thinking" will enable us to apply the teachings to the details of our lives. For example, when turning off the lights at night, if we go to bed late, and we may affect others, if we are not aware of this, or if we have to listen to a recording of the teacher giving lectures before going to bed, which is a habit, but after learning to be considerate of others, then we would need to be mindful of the volume. Or if the person living with us cannot tolerate any sound, "but I will die if I don't listen" then we have become attached. If we have learned that when studying the teachings of sages, we must sacrifice ourselves for others, we need to turn it off. If he is able to sleep, then we are very happy.

We can also be attached to listening to lectures. When we become attached and cause trouble for others, without being aware of it, is that not an attachment? So, where are we attached now? We like to listen to lectures, but do not like to change our habits. After listening, "Wow, good! You spoke very well!" But we do not put even one point into practice. If someone criticizes us, we become unhappy, “You are criticizing me, and you're not any better.” Then the other day, I heard a friend say: “When they talk, every sentence is full of logic, but when they do things, they don’t act with logic at all.” This is very troublesome. What can we do about that? The gap is too big. The principles can be enlightened in an instant, but the actions need to be gradually improved. You really have to constantly let go of selfish desires in order to resolve these attachments. Let go of the concept of high or low. This is the only way we can control our pride, “Learning without thinking is futile.”

“Thinking without learning is perilous.” If we just keep contemplating, without studying the classics, we will feel more and more tired. Because we have no standard from the classics, no matter how much we think, we will still have doubts. Without a standard, doubt is not resolved. Therefore, Confucius said, “I have once spent a whole day without eating,” an entire day without eating, “and a whole night without sleeping,” one night without sleeping, "just to think," by reflecting, but in the end, “it was of no use, and it was not as good as learning.” In this “learning,” there is a very important meaning, which is to take the classics as our teacher, and to deeply immerse ourselves in the teachings so our wisdom will become as vast as the ocean. People nowadays seem to like to be thinking about this and that, without any standard, and they are really just wasting their time and energy. Therefore, in our learning, we must learn and contemplate, and we must apply what we learn to our daily life.

Furthermore, the ninth attitude for learning, in “Shu Er, Seventh,” the Master said, “When three of us walk together, there must be a teacher for me among them. I will select their good points and follow them, and their bad points and correct them." This learning attitude is that at all times, in all places, with all people, and in all situations, there are teachers for us, and we are always a student. With this attitude, all time, people, and situations can improve ourselves. This learning attitude is very valuable. If we don't know how to learn, we turn good conditions into emotional attachments, bad people into opponents, we become greedy in favorable situations, and we shrink away in adverse situations. If we know how to learn, “favorable and adverse circumstances are both the best of situations; the good and bad are both good connections."

Indeed, adverse situations refine us and improve us quickly. The Master ran out of food for seven days in Chen Cai, and in that situation, the Master elevated to a very high level of attainment. All of his students were falling apart, but the Master was there playing his qin, completely unaffected by his circumstances. Later, when the troubles were resolved, a disciple said, “Oh, that was so unfortunate to have experienced that! I hope we never have to go through that again.” The Master said to his disciples, “I do not think that way. I believe that those disciples who have experienced running out of food in Chen Cai together with me will achieve great success in the future.” Because, having gone through this experience, their intentions and will power will all be greatly elevated. Indeed, it seems that many of those disciples did indeed achieve great things. To be more frank, in the Minnan dialect, we say that "eating hardship is like eating nutrients". Nowadays, you see that the young people are very mature and wise, and when you look at their lives, they have definitely gone through many trials and hardships.

Tenth, the Master said, "My Way is one that pervades all." In the Master’s learning, he didn’t try to memorize a lot of information. Instead, he grasped the main principle and used it to integrate all his learning. The Master’s “one pervades all” is the principle of zhong (loyalty) and shu (forgiveness). Actually, to be honest, all learning is inseparable from the two words "zhong" and "shu." Therefore, when our teacher went to the United Nations, he engraved a seal, a very solemn seal, and he gifted it to leaders of various countries. On it were eight characters. For Confucianism, they were “ren, yi, zhong, and shu,” while for Buddhism, they were “zhen cheng, ci bei” (sincerity, and compassion). Actually, the classics of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, do not deviate from this main principle, and there is nothing that does not stem from it.

Let's explore the meaning of zhong (loyalty) and shu (forgiveness): “To do one's best is zhong (loyalty)”; “To consider others is shu (forgiveness).” Shu (forgiveness) is to consider others in the same way one would consider oneself, to be tolerant, and to be empathetic. If a person can always think of doing their best, to do their very best, then he will be able to reflect on himself. “To consider others is shu (forgiveness),” and therefore he will be able to consider others in the same way he would consider himself.


Okay, here's my translation, aiming for accuracy and natural English flow, while maintaining the philosophical tone of the original Chinese:

**Translation:**

"When a person is capable of introspection, they can consistently seek problems within themselves. This is a subjective matter that they can control.  Extending empathy to others, on the other hand, deals with external and objective circumstances.  Constantly looking inward, examining oneself – this is internal study. It enables one to 'perfect oneself'. Towards the external world, one should be forgiving and practice benevolence; this enables one to 'perfect others.' One is an internal, subjective approach, the other an external, objective one. By aligning this inner and outer path, one can enter into the great way of love. Thus, embodying conscientiousness and forgiveness, and thereby entering the path of love – this is grasping the key principle.  Mencius said, 'Practice forgiveness with diligence.' If a person pushes themselves to always be forgiving, to always put themselves in others’ shoes and extend empathy, gradually they will be able to view others as one with themselves in their thoughts.

Alright, our time is almost up for today. We’ll stop our discussion here for now. Thank you everyone!"

**Explanation of Translation Choices and Nuances:**

*   **反求諸己 (fǎn qiú zhū jǐ):** I translated this as "introspection" or "capable of introspection." It carries a sense of deeply examining oneself and finding the source of problems or understanding within.
*   **內 (nèi) / 外 (wài):** These are literally "inner" and "outer," but I've used terms like "subjective" and "objective" at times to clarify the conceptual meaning. The text contrasts looking inward at one's own state and looking outward at the world.
*   **成己 (chéng jǐ) / 成物 (chéng wù):** Literally "to complete oneself" and "to complete things."  I've translated them as "perfect oneself" and "perfect others" because I think it better captures the meaning of cultivating oneself and helping others to do the same.
*   **推己及人 (tuī jǐ jí rén):** "Extending empathy to others" or "putting themselves in others’ shoes" captures the core idea of this phrase.
*   **內學 (nèi xué):**  I translated this as "internal study," as it refers to the process of self-cultivation through inner reflection.
*   **契入 (qì rù):** This phrase means "to enter into" or "to attain a state of." In this context, it's about merging with a path.
*   **仁愛 (rén ài):**  I translated this as "love" or "the great way of love" since it carries the broader connotation of a universal love and benevolence.
*   **忠恕 (zhōng shù):** This is often translated as "conscientiousness and forgiveness." I've kept this translation because it's generally understood in philosophical contexts. It's not just about being loyal but also understanding and forgiving others.
*   **強恕而行 (qiǎng shù ér xíng):** "Practice forgiveness with diligence" captures the idea that forgiveness is not always natural and requires effort to cultivate.
*   **視人於一體 (shì rén yú yī tǐ):**  "View others as one with themselves" is a literal and accurate translation. This is a crucial philosophical concept, suggesting that we see our inherent interconnectedness with others.
*  **交流 (jiāo liú):** "Discussion" was preferred as the best English equivalent for the context.
*   **時間差不多了 (shí jiān chà bù duō le):**  "Our time is almost up" is a natural and common way to express this in English.

**Additional Notes for a Professional Context:**

*   **Target Audience:** The tone and vocabulary of this translation is suitable for a general but educated audience interested in philosophy or Chinese thought.
*   **Contextual Information:** If this translation were for a specific academic paper or a specialized audience, further context about the source material and its philosophical background would be beneficial.

Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural flow while maintaining the tone of a lecture:

**Lecture 11: A Paragon of Educators – The Supreme Sage and Teacher: 2. Confucius's Example as a Teacher**

Esteemed guests, respected elders, and fellow learners, good afternoon!

Our “360 Classics” course is currently discussing the passages on respecting teachers within the “Governing and Principles” section. Sentence 259 states, “Therefore, the ancient sage kings never failed to respect their teachers. When teachers are respected, distinctions of nobility, lowliness, wealth, and poverty are disregarded.” The sages taught us, "The gentleman is devoted to the root; when the root is established, the Way will grow." A teacher is not noble because of their status but because of their conduct. Thus, the respect and love others show us are not things we demand or criticize our way into, but rather are a natural consequence. “Those who love others are constantly loved by others, and those who respect others are constantly respected by others.” If a teacher’s behavior is worthy of respect, then that respect is naturally and rightfully earned.

Just at the beginning of July, the Jumeixin Center in Nanjing hosted a course on revitalizing the Way of the Teacher. There were over 100 participants, including principals, kindergarten directors, and fellow educators. This perfectly aligned with our current topic. So, for the past few weeks, we've been discussing the theme of “Being a Mentor for a Child’s Lifetime” to explore the concept of respecting teachers and the Way of the Teacher. From this topic, we realize that if every teacher focused on the lifelong happiness and achievements of their students, if they had a deep and far-reaching vision, that very intention would be worthy of the respect of their students and the public.

Last time, we discussed the sixth major topic: “A Paragon of Educators—The Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius.” Confucius taught us, “The benevolent love others.” His teachings throughout his life never strayed from the path of benevolence. The Chinese character for “benevolence” (仁) is comprised of two people, reminding us that when we think of ourselves, we must also think of others. Therefore, the benevolent are particularly adept at understanding the needs of others. For example, today you may notice that I’m wearing a headset microphone, which is different from before. Our colleagues in the Information Department genuinely embody benevolence. They noticed that when we lecturers hold microphones, sometimes for one or two hours, we might experience arm fatigue. They were very observant and saw that by the second half of our lectures, we were often struggling and having to support the microphone, or stand to write on the board while holding it, sometimes even having to manage a textbook along with everything, which wasn’t very convenient. So, they prepared these headset microphones for us. This small gesture demonstrates their commitment to benevolence and their consideration for others. This is what is meant by "the unity of knowing and acting." The principles we understand should naturally manifest in our work, in the service we provide to others. This requires meticulous attention to detail and an ability to be observant in all aspects of life, in our conduct, and in how we interact with others. This is what constitutes true learning. Confucius taught us to learn extensively, inquire thoroughly, ponder carefully, discern clearly, and finally, to practice diligently. Extensive learning, thorough inquiry, careful pondering, and clear discernment pertain to knowledge, while diligent practice is about taking immediate action.

Last time we discussed Master Confucius's attitudes towards scholarship. We studied ten excerpts from the classics together. Did the learning process transform our mindset and unite with our souls? This is called “entering the perspective of the text,” where the “perspective” immediately becomes our attitude. This is what constitutes effective learning. Otherwise, even if you hear something ten or twenty times, the principles remain just that - principles. You remain the same. That is simply turning learning into knowledge.

Let’s take an example. Confucius's approach to learning was to “transmit, not create; to believe in and love antiquity.” Once we learn this, we should no longer have the slightest doubt about the classics of ancient sages and worthies. The “belief” should penetrate our hearts. And the “love of antiquity” – "to know is not as good as to love, and to love is not as good as to delight" – signifies that we should trust in the wisdom and benevolence of the ancient sages and worthies, that we should cherish every minute and not waste any time, that we should study whenever we have time. This “belief in and love of antiquity” will transform our attitudes through learning, and this is what is known as “self-cultivation.” It is about correcting our attitudes and correcting our erroneous behaviors. “To transmit, not create” means that the words we utter should all be based on the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies, and we shouldn’t casually interject our own opinions. Because we are educators, if we speak based on our own ideas and they are not aligned with the truth, then we will mislead the students. Therefore, upon learning the principle of "transmitting, not creating", we must ensure that every time we speak, it is in accordance with the teachings of the sages, and not out of our own afflictions, habits, ideas, and views. You see how careful and respectful Master Confucius was in his approach to learning. When giving a lecture to students, we must be worthy of the opportunity that comes with that class. We must absolutely not mislead others. Even the sages approach scholarship with such rigor, so how much more should we, whose understanding is far inferior to that of the ancients, follow their example? We should emulate Confucius’ attitude when he was a student, his approach to scholarship.

Today, we will continue to explore Master Confucius’ conduct and delve into the ancient classics to discover his example as a teacher. We are currently on the sixth major topic: "A Paragon of Educators—The Supreme Sage and Teacher, Confucius.” Last week we discussed Confucius's scholarly approach that deserves our emulation and learning. Today we will discuss his example as a teacher.

First of all, wisdom. In *The Doctrine of the Mean*, Confucius mentioned, “The five universal paths of the world” are the five cardinal relationships: the affection between father and son, the righteousness between ruler and subject, the distinction between husband and wife, the order between elders and juniors, and the trustworthiness between friends. Human relationships cannot be separated from these five. In order to truly perfect and harmonize these five relationships, we must rely on the three universal virtues. These three universal virtues also apply to the relationship between teacher and student. In ancient times, the relationship between teacher and student was like that of father and son. This falls under the father-son relationship. However, now, some say that the teacher-student relationship should only be like that of friends. However, it cannot be separated from these five cardinal relationships. In reality, you should put forth as much effort as the conditions and relationships allow. However, the single-minded devotion to the success of the student should remain constant. But relationships have varying depths.

To perfect the five cardinal relationships and the teacher-student relationship, we must first study the three universal virtues. Where is wisdom manifested? In "focusing on the root." *The Analects* teaches us, "The gentleman is devoted to the root; when the root is established, the Way will grow." "Filial piety and brotherly respect are the roots of benevolence!" When people love their parents, they can then learn to love others. When people respect their older brothers and sisters, and cherish their siblings, they can then learn to cherish their classmates and friends. Lin Zexu left behind “Ten No-Benefits,” which are incredibly insightful. The "no-benefit" concept refers to the fact that if one doesn't follow these ten principles in life, then this life may be meaningless and may consist only of superficial actions. Among these ten no-benefits, it's mentioned, “Without filial piety to parents, offering prayers is useless.” All the deities teach us to begin with filial piety. If you pray every day but do not put it into practice, you are simply squandering the teachings of the sages. How can you expect to be blessed? Of course, it's useless. "Without harmony among siblings, making friends is useless." If you don't even love your closest family members, your friendships will be made with an ulterior motive and not based on genuine affection. This all comes down to focusing on the root.

A person must focus on the root, or they will put the cart before the horse. Many people now treat their clients incredibly well, but they ignore their own parents. This will be looked down upon in society. They cannot be successful, and their career will not be long-lasting. "He seems to be making a lot of money right now.” That's just because of blessings from his ancestors. He still does not understand how to conduct himself. Those blessings will soon diminish. Therefore, if you think about it rationally, any enterprise that lacks a root cannot be sustainable. This is why the lifespan of companies in our society is getting shorter and shorter. I recall the statistics from many years ago – perhaps the situation is even more severe now. About ten years ago, the average lifespan of a small-to-medium-sized company was 2.9 years. A business closes in less than three years, it’s almost like playing house! It’s a mess. The average lifespan of a large company is about seven to eight years. Large corporations involve so many assets and so many employees. And yet they shut down in seven to eight years. This creates a lot of societal and domestic problems! The unsustainability of these businesses is an effect, and what is the cause? The cause is the lack of moral grounding. Once they earn some money, temptations come along and they completely collapse. Therefore, this emphasis on the root is extremely important.

In fact, can we see how the short lifespans of these businesses relate to us as educators? Yes, the owner of a business could be our former student. Therefore, all domestic problems, group problems, and societal problems are all problems of the human mind. They must be resolved through the education of the sages in order to change the human heart. The chaos in the family and in society today can all be resolved through education. Thus, when we read sentences from the *Analects*, we can truly understand the saying, “Half an *Analects* can rule an empire.” Let's just look at one sentence: “Filial piety and brotherly respect are the roots of benevolence!” If someone is filial, they will love others. They will extend their filial devotion to loyalty. This resolves so many problems. Where can there be conflicts? Where can there be disloyalty to the nation or to leadership? Brotherly respect leads to love for classmates and friends, resolving various conflicts. So, it is no exaggeration that truly, half an *Analects* can rule an empire.

When we examine this concept of "focusing on the root", we realize how critical it is for an educator. We certainly cannot teach our entire lives and end up putting the cart before the horse, or even worse, forgetting the root completely. Wouldn't we then be doing bad things with good intentions? There are so many educators who are incredibly earnest, yet they see the quality of their students deteriorating, and they can’t find the root cause. I feel the same. It is not that each generation is worse than the last, but that every year is worse than the previous. I am very worried as well. Fortunately, with the blessings and protection of our ancestors, I happened to find the classic, *The Classic of Filial Piety*, and within the opening chapter, I saw the most critical sentence on focusing on the root, "Filial piety is the root of virtue." The most fundamental basis for morality was found. "It is that from which education arises," "education" here being the education system. So if we don’t start education with filial piety, then it is not true education. This is of great significance to us. We can’t spend our entire careers without even knowing what the "root" is.

Some might think, there are so many schools now, from kindergarten to university, with eighteen years of schooling. Isn’t that education? If you don’t teach filial piety, then it is a knowledge-transmitting institution. It teaches a lot of knowledge, but not how to be a good person. We can see that in the news. There are unfilial children. And it’s not like unfilial children are just those who didn’t have an education. Those with the highest academic qualifications can start fighting over assets before their parents are even buried. Think about it rationally. Many business tycoons, their children are graduates of schools in the US, France, and Germany, but why is it that their coffins have remained unburied for one or two years after their deaths? They cannot settle their affairs. They have raised so many descendants, all with one or two decades of education, yet they do not understand filial piety and only understand money. They worship money. How can materialism be considered education? How can utilitarianism be considered education?

Confucius said, “The gentleman understands righteousness," meaning that nurturing a gentleman means helping him to understand morality, to understand the duty of being a human, of knowing what one’s responsibility is within the family, within a group, and within the country. This is how you cultivate a gentleman. “The petty man understands profit.” If we teach competition from kindergarten, then we are nurturing petty people who will wound their parents' hearts, their leaders' hearts, and the hearts of others. Even if they have twenty years of accumulated knowledge, they will still not be able to benefit others, because their hearts are corrupt. The higher their talents, the more harmful they become. We, as educators, must understand this. I once heard a fellow educator say, “Talent without virtue is dangerous.” Others have said it more directly, “It is like a toxic substance.” This means they are harming society. *The Zizhi Tongjian*, written by Sima Guang over nineteen years, includes an essay called “On Talent and Virtue,” which states, “Talent exceeding virtue is called a petty man.” This aligns with what Confucius said, “The petty man understands profit,” meaning the petty man is always thinking about himself and will not be able to benefit others.

So when I saw this sentence in *The Classic of Filial Piety*, it was as if a light had shone before my eyes. In my home, I was so elated, I couldn’t express my feelings. I ran several laps and thumped on the table. "Ah, this is great! This is great!" Finally I have found the root. My heart is at peace, settled upon this truth. Even if the whole world refuses to teach it, we must. Why? Because we cannot let down Confucius and his insight. The sages of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism all teach us to start with filial piety. It is the foundation of being a person. Lao Tzu also spoke of loyalty, filial piety, brotherly respect, and reverence, all of which stem from this root.

Let's review a few phrases that will give us more insight into this wisdom of focusing on the root. These phrases are actually from our *360 Classics* course. Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius if it was auspicious to build a house facing east. Confucius replied that there were five inauspicious things, and the direction in which a house was built was not one of them. All of these five inauspicious things are related to the wisdom of focusing on the root. “Harming others to benefit oneself is inauspicious for oneself.” Such a mindset constantly diminishes one’s own blessings. How can this be auspicious? To harm others to benefit yourself is foolish. Harming others is definitely not beneficial to oneself, and this is the greatest misfortune one can bring upon oneself. It is inauspicious. Then, referring to the family: “Neglecting the elderly and favoring the young,” the path of filial piety is lost, “This is inauspicious for the family.” Regarding the nation: “Dismissing the worthy and appointing the unworthy,” this means not wanting capable and honest people. They would rather keep such people far away and appoint those who flatter and fawn upon them. “This is inauspicious for the nation." It's said, "With the right people in place, policies will succeed." Only when there are righteous and selfless leaders can one achieve success in any endeavor. Now, there is no desire for talent. You see that every word of Master Confucius speaks of the fundamental root. Let’s also review a sentence from the *Memorial on Dispatching the Army*. If one doesn’t cry when reading this *Memorial*, then one is not loyal. This is a timeless piece of writing, penned by a loyal minister. It points out the most critical key to a nation’s rise, decline, peace, or chaos. Zhuge Liang said, "Appointing virtuous ministers and keeping petty men at a distance, this is why the Early Han Dynasty prospered. Appointing petty men and keeping virtuous ministers at a distance, this is why the Later Han Dynasty declined.” During the reigns of Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling of the Later Han, the eunuchs were in power and the people were living in abject poverty. Those with virtue were banished or even killed. Thus, Master Confucius’ words are full of wisdom. “Dismissing the worthy and appointing the unworthy, this is inauspicious for the nation."

"When the elderly do not teach, and the young do not learn, this is inauspicious for the customs of the people." The customs of society are getting worse and worse. Why? Because parents don’t teach their children, teachers don’t teach their students, leaders don't guide their subordinates, and elders don’t guide the younger generation. In the past, if an adult saw a child misbehaving, even if it was a child they didn’t know, they would still guide the child. This is because each child will be the future master of society. If they don't know what is right, they will harm society. So, the sense of responsibility every adult had in the past was so high. However, the current trend is, “Children have their own ideas, students have their own ideas. We cannot control them." You have to bear the responsibility of speaking those words. Those who hear us say this will think it is correct. Thus, you are misguiding their attitude towards life, misguiding the public's perception. "If you raise them without teaching them, it's the father's fault. If you teach them but are not strict, it's the teacher's fault." Behind each role and duty in life, there is a responsibility. How can we say we cannot control them? How can we say it is not our problem? This is far too irresponsible. This is why the next generation has not been educated properly, becoming more and more arrogant and unwilling to listen to their parents. This may be because of our own biased attitudes.

The fifth inauspicious thing is: “When sages are in hiding, and fools wield power.” When sages do not come out, then those who only care about instant success will be in power and will lead the whole world’s trends towards the pursuit of fame and profit. This is what constitutes “the inauspiciousness of the world.” Today, in pursuit of immediate profit, they are destroying our Earth, our mother, and leaving it in tatters. From an environmental standpoint, this is inauspicious for the world. From an ideological standpoint, they are harming the body and mind of the next generation. Who are these "fools"? They are the authors of flawed books. There are many bestsellers that are full of erroneous and deviant ideas. They become “fools wielding power.” This also includes a country's minister of education or those in charge of education. If they have a distorted view of education, putting the cart before the horse, “fools wielding power,” they will not be able to nurture the next generation. This is what constitutes “the inauspiciousness of the world.”

Therefore, we need to revitalize the wisdom, the concepts, the experiences, the methods, and the effects of the five thousand years of education of our ancestors. We must achieve results. Because people today do not believe in the teachings of our ancestors. If you don’t achieve results, they will remain skeptical. Today, education throughout the world places more emphasis on knowledge, skills, and exams, and does not emphasize filial piety and character, the most critical parts. So if a school can achieve great results through the practice of moral education, and becomes an example for the nation and for the world, then the merit is immense. In this day and age, people will say, “If you say it's good, then show me the evidence!” You must show results of an experiment. Therefore, at the end of 2005, my teacher established a Chinese Culture Education Center in Lujiang, where ethical and moral education, *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, and filial piety were promoted among 48,000 townspeople. Within one year, the divorce and crime rates greatly decreased, which proved that people can be taught to be good. The public, including the Chinese people in Malaysia, I remember, during one of the courses in 2008, 147 principals, teachers, and parents from Malaysia attended. The plane was almost completely chartered by them. The Chinese worldwide value their culture so dearly. When one area demonstrates results, people become more confident and begin to follow their example. Currently, in Klang, at Xinghua Primary School, and in other schools where pilot programs are yielding positive outcomes, many people, including educators from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, come to inquire and absorb the experiences of these schools. They can only achieve confidence through seeing results.

So, to ensure that the education of the sages can be promoted and spread, my teacher offered a very important point, “A harmonious society starts from within my heart.” It starts with us, with our own actions. “Human beings can spread the Way.” If I am a teacher, I must fulfill my role as a teacher. If I am a father, I must fulfill my role as a father. If I am a wife, I must fulfill my role as a wife. Within our current roles, we should embody the Great Way and benevolence. When the people who interact with us see us, they will be moved. Then, the Way will spread.

Next, let's look at the second point: The wisdom of Master Confucius is manifested in his ability to see things with great foresight and not just from a narrow, short-sighted view. To borrow a phrase from *Liaofan’s Four Lessons,* this ability to see things with foresight can be seen in these aspects: "Not focusing on the immediate, but on the future implications; not focusing on the current moment, but on the long-term effects; not focusing on the individual, but on the world." Where is the root of the problem in society today? Impatience and a desire for instant success, which actually means, “the more haste, the less speed.”

Confucius had a very high prestige during his time. He had three thousand disciples, including seventy-two great ones. Among his disciples, Zilu was the most valiant. It seemed in that era no one could surpass Zilu in his valor. In terms of political wisdom, no one could surpass Yan Hui, and in terms of financial management, Ran Qiu was very strong. As for Zigon’s diplomatic talent, no one could match him. These things were recorded throughout history. When two nations were on the verge of war, Zigon stepped forward, explained the grand principle, and the war was averted. With so many talents and disciples, why didn't Confucius launch a revolution at that time? If he launched a revolution, he could govern a nation himself and set an example for the world. Wouldn't that have been better? Why did he travel to so many states for fourteen years, encountering so many dangers? This is what some of us might think. But Confucius had a long-term view. He saw that the current national leaders hadn’t become so corrupt to the point that revolution was necessary. They were not like Jie of Xia or Zhou of Shang, who abused the people. The situation hadn't yet reached that point. If he launched a revolution, then in the future, anyone who did not have the virtue of Confucius could easily attempt to usurp power, causing the people to suffer even more. Therefore, Confucius considered "not focusing on the current moment, but on the long-term effects; not focusing on the individual, but on the world."

In the *Analects*, Confucius said, “He who first made funerary figures deserves to have no posterity!" Confucius was very accurate in his observation. Upon seeing the making of clay figurines for burial, Confucius said that those making the figurines would eventually have no descendants. Why? Because the figurines were made to look so real, it would eventually lead to people using real human beings for burials. So, the sages can anticipate a problem and prevent it early. This demonstrates their farsightedness. Therefore, “his actions will be an example to the world for generations to come; his conduct will be the model for the world for generations to come; and his words will be the standard for the world for generations to come.” Every single one of his words and actions was meant to be an example for those of his time and for generations to come. He could not be casual, he could not be negligent, and he was always respectful and careful.

*Liaofan’s Four Lessons* has a very concrete example. Confucius’ disciple, Zigong, went to redeem people from the state of Lu who had been taken captive in other states, and spent his own money to bring them back.

According to the laws at the time, the Lu state government would have given a ransom to Zigong [a disciple of Confucius] for saving people, but Zigong said he didn’t need it, demonstrating his generosity. When Confucius learned about this, he criticized Zigong. This is because while such an action might seem noble, the people of Lu were not wealthy. They were not like Zigong, who was a wealthy merchant. If Zigong didn't accept the ransom, those who wanted to save people in the future would hesitate. They might think, "I don’t have much money. If I redeem someone, I would feel embarrassed to accept the ransom." This hesitation could lead to them not redeeming the person, thus depriving them of a crucial life opportunity. If you redeem a man, his parents, wife, and children would have someone to care for them. Therefore, Confucius seized this opportunity to teach Zigong that in doing anything, you must consider the situation of the whole society and the state. You can’t just be impulsive and do whatever you want. "The actions of a sage" must be such that they shift customs and mores, and thus educate the people.

Another day, Zilu [another disciple of Confucius] saw a man drowning and bravely jumped in to save him. The man, grateful for having his life saved, was so moved that he gave Zilu a cow from his household. Do you know how much a cow is worth in today’s money? For example, if you’re running a factory, a cow is equivalent to the cost of a large piece of machinery – something you rely on for your livelihood. Happily, the man gifted the cow, and Zilu accepted it. Confucius praised Zilu, saying, “You rescued a person from drowning.” Because you rescued him from the brink of death, the person was grateful and gave you a cow. Henceforth, the people of Lu will say, "Kindness is rewarded." This will drive a culture of virtuous deeds. From a common perspective, Zigong not accepting the ransom seems more noble, while Zilu accepting the cow appears less refined. But Confucius did not view things in this way. He looked at the bigger picture, considering the long-term effects. This shows how profound his understanding was. We, as teachers, must also have such a profound perspective so that we can nurture students who have wisdom.

Third, how can we perceive the wisdom of the Master? The following points correspond with the most important teaching methods in *The Record of Rituals - The Meaning of Education* [禮記‧學記]: “To prevent before it happens is called preparedness" (禁於未發之謂豫). A wise person, when educating themselves and others, uses preventative measures. They don't wait for someone to acquire a bad habit and then try to correct it; that would be like trying to mend the sheep after the sheep is lost. The Master said, “Habits formed young feel like nature.” The *I Ching* says, “Nourish righteousness in the young; this is the work of sages" (蒙以養正，聖功也). Thus, the wisdom of education lies in “preventing before it happens.” This applies not only to educating others but also to educating oneself. If we haven't acquired bad habits, "prevent evil from arising," we cannot let ourselves be influenced by them. If a bad habit has already arisen, you must correct it immediately. “If you have made a mistake, do not hesitate to change it.”

Where else is this third point manifested? It is manifested in many of the Master’s teachings. We can use just one example. The Master said, “A gentleman has three cautions" (君子有三戒). This "caution" means taking preventative measures. “In youth, when one’s vital energies are unstable, one should guard against lust" (少之時，血氣未定，戒之在色). Therefore, protecting the minds of young people is vital. "Do not look at impure books". Currently, teenagers all over the world are in a dire state because evil books and movies are disrupting their pure hearts. Parents and teachers must understand this, and especially the country needs to manage the publications, DVDs, internet, and media effectively. The people need to be protected. Children need to be protected, and they also need to be given critical thinking skills to isolate themselves from these sources of pollution.

“In the prime of life, when one's vital energies are strong, one should guard against contentiousness” (及其壯也，血氣方剛，戒之在鬥). What is contentiousness? It is competitiveness, jealousy, and the inability to see others excel. Have you ever noticed that people of similar ages are more competitive? For example, if we are now forty years old and see someone of a similar age who is doing much better than us, we might think, "What's so great about them, it’s just good luck." Or we might want to compete with them. We do not understand that "Praising the goodness in others is in itself a good thing” (道人善，即是善). These are all serious bad habits. If you can genuinely teach a child, start by having them guard against lust and contentiousness, so that when they “see goodness in others, they immediately think to emulate it" (見人善，即思齊). Then they won't be competitive.

"And in old age, when one’s vital energy is declining, one should guard against greed" (及其老也，血氣既衰，戒之在得). Therefore, a person's fear of gain and loss usually becomes more severe with age. Unless the person lives with clear understanding, recognizing that the most important thing in life is to elevate the spirit and increase wisdom, instead of seeking more material things. Because the more one seeks, the greater the suffering of unfulfilled desires. Thus, most people in the world do not understand the meaning of life. They have gone astray, and the more they live, the less they smile. Let's not talk about others, let’s just consider ourselves. When we compare our smiles today to when we were two or three years old, which time period had more smiles? This is the educational wisdom of “preventing before it happens."

Fourth is teaching according to individual aptitude (因材施教). You need a good understanding of someone's level and mentality before you can guide them effectively. *The Record of Rituals - The Meaning of Education* says, "To teach step-by-step, without overreaching, is called gentle guidance" (不陵節而施之謂孫). When speaking to someone about filial piety, you should address them at the level that they can understand. If they are not yet capable of feeling for their parents, then telling them, "Establish yourself in the Way and make a name for yourself in future generations to honor your parents," is too high-minded; they won’t understand it. Thus, teaching should be step-by-step. In *The Record of Rituals - The Meaning of Education* there is a line that is a very good explanation of teaching according to individual aptitude: "Know their minds, then you can correct their faults" (知其心，然後能救其失也). You have to know where their thinking is skewed before you can guide them onto the right path. “Teaching means to cultivate their strengths and correct their faults” (教也者，長善而救其失者也). The two most important principles of education are to cultivate strengths and correct faults. “Know their minds” means to understand where their thinking is wrong, so that you can help them.

But if we think about it, “Knowing others is wise; knowing oneself is enlightened” (知人者智，自知者明). If we don’t even know ourselves, how can we possibly know others? Therefore, if we want to know others and help them, we must first know ourselves and help ourselves. Once, Confucius asked three of his students, what is a wise person and what is a benevolent person? Zilu said, "A wise person causes others to know him, and a benevolent person causes others to love him." Zigong said, "A benevolent person loves others, and a wise person knows others.” Finally, Yan Hui [another disciple of Confucius] said, "A wise person knows himself, and a benevolent person loves himself.” This goes back to the root. How can a person whose life is messed up and chaotic go and love others? Yet, there are many people like that these days. For example, they have made a mess of their own health and career and then, when they meet someone they admire, they say, “I will make you happy!” The bottom line is they are deceiving others. If they can’t even love themselves, what kind of concepts and attitudes can they use to love others?

This teaching according to individual aptitude is the fourth point. Let’s look at some concrete examples, starting with teaching filial piety. How did the Master teach filial piety according to individual aptitude? He observed each student's mentality and their current family situation. In *Analects Book II: On Governance*, there are several consecutive passages about filial piety. What does filial piety have to do with governance? It has a lot to do with it. *The Classic of Filial Piety* tells us at the very beginning: "The former kings possessed the most excellent virtue and the most important way to harmonize the world, so that the people were in harmony and that there was no resentment between the ruler and the ruled." Therefore, if the whole country promoted filial piety, then the world would be in good order and the country would be well-governed. That’s why *Analects II* discusses filial piety multiple times, as it is deeply connected with governance and is its foundation. Because “In establishing a state and leading its people, education comes first,” and in education, filial piety comes first.

The text first mentions, "Meng Yizi asked about filial piety" (孟懿子問孝). Meng Yizi was a high official and also a student of Confucius. His father, Meng Xizi, told his two sons before his death that after he dies, they must learn propriety and knowledge from Confucius. When Meng Yizi asked Confucius about filial piety, Confucius replied: “Do not violate.” After giving the answer, the matter was closed. When Fan Chi [another disciple of Confucius] was driving Confucius home, Confucius said to Fan Chi, “Just now, Meng Sun [Meng Yizi's family name] asked me about filial piety, and I told him ‘Do not violate’." Then Fan Chi, while driving the carriage, asked, "Master, what does 'do not violate' mean?" Now think about it. If he were truly eager to learn, he wouldn’t have waited for Confucius to ask him, would he? If we were back in the Spring and Autumn period and able to drive the Master's carriage, wouldn't we feel blessed? We would be able to ask him questions face to face, right? But look, those who were actually by his side did not proactively ask. The Master had to initiate the question. This shows the Master's compassion in seizing every opportunity to inspire his students. Even if the students did not ask proactively, since they were by his side, he would ask them. This is the first level of meaning.

To be frank, Confucius should have been able to tell from his student’s expressions whether they understood or not. Even though their eyes were wide open, it wasn't a look of comprehension. Comprehension makes eyes light up. A lack of comprehension makes one a bit dull, but they would still nod their heads. The first level of meaning is that Fan Chi did not understand. The second level of meaning is that Meng Yizi probably didn't understand either, but he didn't ask proactively. Therefore, through his classmate, the Master confirmed again whether or not he had understood. Fan Chi said, “What does ‘Do not violate’ mean?” Confucius then explained to him: “While [parents] are alive, serve them with propriety. When they die, bury them with propriety and offer sacrifices with propriety.” Because learning from the Master was his father’s dying request to Meng Yizi, he should not violate it. This is showing respect to one’s father. "While alive, serve them with propriety. When they die, bury them with propriety and offer sacrifices with propriety" means to treat them with propriety and perform one’s filial duty as a child.

There is also an implicit meaning. Because Confucius admired the Zhou rituals, he wanted the three noble families to restore the proper ritual system. Their city walls were built too high, and they should have been torn down to comply with the proper ritual system. But Meng Yizi was the only one who did not listen and did not comply. Therefore, the Master’s implicit meaning was also to remind them of where their virtue was lacking. That is why Meng Yizi’s name is not included in the Master’s “Biographies of Disciples.” Everyone knows that he was the Master’s student, but why isn't he included? The ancients were very wise in how they handled these things. With one action they showed the essence of the matter. Why? Being with the Master for decades is not the same as being a disciple. If you do not obey the Master’s words, you are not a disciple in substance.

Did these actions educate future generations? For example, when Sima Qian wrote *Records of the Grand Historian*, he placed Confucius in “Noble Families”. That's the aristocracy! By writing it this way, wasn't he highlighting Confucius’ contribution to the entire nation? “Confucius of the Noble Family.” Therefore, Confucius is called “Uncrowned King”. Although he was a commoner, his influence surpassed that of a king, and his contributions were greater than a king's. That is why Sima Qian was not an ordinary person. He also put Xiang Yu [a military leader] into “The Annals”. The Annals were for the emperors. Why did he put Xiang Yu in the Annals? To remind future generations that Xiang Yu had great opportunities to become an emperor, but in the end, why did he commit suicide? To remind future generations that he was too arrogant, and even before he died, he didn't know his own fault, instead blaming it on heaven. “Heaven has doomed me, not because I couldn’t win a battle.” Therefore, the intentions of these sages truly enlightened future generations.

Another student asked about filial piety. This was actually Meng Yizi's eldest son, "Meng Wubo asked about filial piety" (孟武伯問孝). Confucius replied: “Parents are only worried about a child’s illness” (父母唯其疾之憂). Why did Confucius instruct him in this way? He must have understood his situation. And this sentence is very meaningful. "Only" (唯) means that this is the only concern. "Their" (其) refers to the child. Parents are only worried when a child is sick. They don’t worry about anything else. This means that the child’s virtue, family, career, and habits do not cause parents any concern. Only in this way is a person fulfilling their filial duty. We are now adults. If our words, actions, and habits still make our parents worried: "Oh, they are smoking again," "Oh, they are drinking again," "Oh, they lost their temper again," that is all unfilial. So, this passage gives us much to ponder. We must immediately calm down and consider: what do my parents still worry about me? If there is worry, then I have failed. We need to quickly eliminate whatever worries our parents, and thus fulfill our filial duty. To nurture the hearts of our parents, don't cause them any more worries.

The next sentence, "Ziyou asked about filial piety" (子游問孝). Confucius replied, "The filial piety of today" (今之孝者), “means the ability to provide for” (是謂能養) their parents. People believe that if they can provide their parents with food and clothing, they have fulfilled filial piety. “Even dogs and horses are able to provide” (至於犬馬，皆能有養). Dogs guard the house at night and horses pull carts for their owners. They are also providing for their masters. Sons and daughters providing for their parents are also providing. But, “Without respect, what is the difference?” (不敬，何以別乎?). If this act of providing does not come with respect, then what difference is there between our providing and the providing of animals? So, the difference between humans and animals in providing is that the former comes from heartfelt respect. The Master pointed out that people at that time were only being superficial in fulfilling their filial duties and had not considered their attitudes.

Let’s bring this back to the current day. Today, our standards might be that just giving our parents money is good enough. But when we give money to our parents, do we have a respectful attitude? Do we kneel down, place the money on our forehead, and present it to our parents? Or do we say, “Mom, here, take it!” That just makes parents feel worse! To be frank, much of the money that we children give to our parents is often saved for our future and even our grandchildren. The importance lies in the grateful and respectful attitude. The Master’s teachings, which transcend time and space, remind us of this.

Fourth is, “Zixia asked about filial piety” (子夏問孝). Confucius said, “It is difficult to maintain a pleasant expression” (色難) when serving parents. Earlier, in the first sentence, we talked about "not violating," which means to follow your parents’ wishes and not go against them. So, there is a "follow" (順) in the idea of "filial obedience" (孝順). If what your parents say is correct, do it quickly. If your parents' approach is not quite right, do not immediately contradict them. Instead, be flexible and try to persuade them. Therefore, this word "follow" is very important. You should not show any attitude that might displease your parents. Because with "follow", your parents' hearts can feel more at ease.

For example, if your mother is old and has a lot of grey hair, and she tells you every day, "Daughter, I want to dye my hair." You, as the daughter, say, "Mom, dyeing your hair is bad for your kidneys and will affect your health." If your mother keeps saying it for months, and you still don't do it, it might make her very uncomfortable. Maybe she even knows that her days are numbered and just wants to look more dignified when she departs this world. This is her wish. Just yesterday I heard about a case from a colleague whose grandmother was like this. His mother also wanted the best for her mother, but did not understand her mother's heart. When the old lady saw her daughter did not help her dye her hair, she dyed it herself. When she heard her daughter’s footsteps coming up, she lay down in bed and pretended to be asleep. Old people are like children, they're very cute. This daughter understood that her mother really wanted to dye her hair, so she immediately said gently, "Mom, I'll help you dye your hair." And it turned out that not long after her hair was dyed, the old lady passed away. So, the daughter felt glad that she had dyed her hair, or else this daughter would have had lifelong regret for not having followed her mother's wishes. Of course, it would be even better if you bought a natural hair dye.

Therefore, when elderly parents want to eat something, do not use a nutritional perspective, such as, "How much vitamin is in this, or that?" Don't use such logic to suppress them. We must try to understand their wishes. This is the concept of "follow". Be gentle and have a pleasant expression. And that pleasant expression is not just an act, but comes from what? It comes from feeling it’s the greatest blessing to be able to take care of one’s parents, a chance to repay their kindness. Hence, this pleasant expression is without the slightest bit of reluctance.

There is a filial son in mainland China, Teacher Wang Xihai, who cared for his father for twenty-six years. In those twenty-six years, he felt his life was very fulfilling. He was happiest when his father was sleeping peacefully, eating well, and was joyous. Because fulfilling filial duty corresponds with one's innate nature: "Learning and practicing regularly is a pleasure." Therefore, those who can truly care for their parents, for example, in the hospital where they have not been able to eliminate waste for five or seven days. Teacher Wang Xihai said that a child should be unable to bear waiting that many days for their parents to be unable to do this naturally. You must take proactive measures! He immediately thought of a method. The many good methods of humans, where do they come from? They come from a heart of filial piety, from a sincere heart. When a person has an indomitable sincere heart, there are limitless wonderful uses. Then methods appear. He very carefully massaged his father's entire abdomen, and used a hot towel for warmth, and then used the hot towel to warm the anus. Then his father was able to eliminate waste. When he saw his father relax and felt comfortable, he felt that it was the greatest happiness of his life. A filial son only thinks of his parents, and his parents' joy is his joy.

It's the same as how we felt when we were growing up. When we were sick, our parents were even happier than we were when we got well. When we were sick, they would vow to heaven to transfer the illness to themselves, so that their children would not suffer. This is the natural love between parents and children. Teacher Wang Xihai's innate nature remained unchanged throughout his life. Because Teacher Wang Xihai often goes to the hospital, he said that one of the biggest reasons for parents’ illnesses is that they worry about their children. We all know that one of the biggest reasons for poor health is that our emotions are affected. Parents get sick because they worry about their children. However, after parents become ill, they are particularly afraid of troubling their children and feel guilty. The children don't realize that the parents became sick because of them and are still suffering in their hearts. They are worried about troubling us. How can taking care of parents be considered a trouble? Repaying our parents’ kindness is a matter of course. Therefore, we children have failed to be considerate. If we are only caring for our parents for a day or two, we become irritable and impatient. We scold our parents in the hospital and yell at them in the hallway. Parents can feel all of this. Wouldn't that make them feel even worse?

Therefore, when we see that it is "difficult to maintain a pleasant expression", we realize that, whether we are talking about filial sons of ancient times or filial sons of modern times, their state of mind is admirable. They always think about how to make their parents happy, not about themselves. For us, we tend to think using our own perspectives. “Wow, twenty-six years! That must have been difficult!” That is not how filial sons think. Filial sons remind us that when you’re caring for your parents, if you have a thought such as, “I need to endure, I need to endure, I have to hang on,” then that heart is already selfish. Only thinking of yourself would cause you to think, “I have to hang on.” If you are constantly thinking of your parents, you will definitely not have thoughts such as, “Oh, it's so hard, so tiring.” As soon as you have that kind of thought, it will gradually change to, “I am tired, it’s so difficult,” then “I resent,” “I’m impatient,” and eventually to “I hate.” And that's where the problems start. So, the difference between filial sons and us, lies in the intention behind our actions. We are self-serving. They only think of their parents. Therefore, having a pleasant expression is most precious. This “difficulty” is something rare and valuable.

“When there is work, the disciples should take it upon themselves to serve” (有事，弟子服其勞), means that the disciples should diligently serve their teacher. “When there is wine and food, the teachers should have it first” (有酒食，先生饌), means that if there is good food, the teachers should have it first. “Is this what it means to be filial?” (曾是以為孝乎?). If it is only a matter of “taking responsibility for the work” and “providing wine and food to teachers,” then this is not yet a delicate form of fulfilling filial duty. Because, to a teacher, what is most important is respect. But to parents, there is the natural love between parents and children, as well as the need for a pleasant expression. Because parents and children are connected at the heart, parents can feel whether our actions are willing or not. During interactions, there will be times of gentle playfulness and these intimate gestures. These exist between parents and children, while with a teacher, the main thing is propriety and respect. This was the discussion on filial piety, and this demonstrates teaching according to individual aptitude.

Next is the topic of what constitutes a gentleman. Many students asked about what it meant to be a gentleman. Due to time, I won't give too many examples. We will use the example of Zigong. When Zigong asked about a gentleman, Confucius, in response to Zigong’s specific characteristics, said, “First, put it into practice, then speak it” (先行其言，而後從之). First do those things that you are going to say. This will mean your words and actions are in alignment. This is the character of a gentleman. Zigong was known for his eloquent speech. Thus, the Master reminded him that to realize the gentleman's path, one should first "put it into practice and then speak it". Also, students asked how to realize benevolence. How can you realize the "benevolence" of love? When students were about to take positions in government, they would ask about how to govern a territory. The Master’s guidance was different for each of his students. These all show that he taught according to individual aptitude.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, while maintaining the tone of a professional book translation:

**The Fifth Point of Wisdom: Seizing Teachable Moments, Embodying the Wisdom of Confucius**

The fifth point of wisdom lies in seizing teachable moments, an embodiment of Confucius's wisdom. In the *Record of Learning* (from the *Book of Rites*), it says, "To act when the time is right." This means that when the conditions are ripe, when the timing is just right, when the student trusts the teacher, that is the opportune moment to guide them, and the lesson will leave a deep impression. For example, let's continue with our previous discussion of Zigong. One day, Zigong was criticizing others, "Zigong was judging people." When Confucius learned of this, he immediately reminded him, "Ci, are you so virtuous?"  (Ci was Zigong's given name). Do you have so much time and leisure to criticize others? "I, on the other hand, do not have enough time."  I am so busy working on my own shortcomings that I don't have enough time. How can you have so much time to criticize others?  Zigong was eloquent, and he had the bad habit of criticizing others. Confucius immediately seized the moment to educate him.

What else can constitute a teachable moment?  When you observe a student's state of mind and realize they have misunderstood something, and that misunderstanding will lead them further astray, you should proactively remind them.  For example, Confucius asked Zigong: "Do you think the Master learns through rote memorization, by being broadly learned and having a strong memory?" Is that how he studies? This implies that Zigong viewed his teacher as someone who was widely knowledgeable and had a strong memory. Upon hearing this, Zigong replied, "Yes, it is so." He had misjudged his own teacher. Confucius, discerning this, proactively reminded him, "No, I am guided by a single thread."  Confucius’s way of study is that, "My Way is guided by a single thread," the way of conscientiousness and reciprocity permeates the whole study process, rather than a rote memorization of a great quantity of things, which is mere knowledge.

Another time, we should be grateful to Zigong, because his interactions with Confucius are very helpful for us in learning from the Sages. Zigong stated, "What I do not wish others to impose on me, I also wish not to impose on others." He expressed his innermost feelings: “I don’t want others to treat me this way, and I won’t treat others that way.” Confucius immediately seized this opportunity, “Ci, that’s not yet your level; you are not yet at that height.” To be able to do what you describe is called, "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself." That in itself is not simple. We don’t want others to misunderstand us, so we also don’t misunderstand others; we don’t want others to doubt us, so we also don’t doubt others; we don’t want others to get angry with us, so we also can’t get angry with others.  Wow, if that is the case, there will be no greed, hatred, ignorance, or arrogance. If a person in their studies mistakenly believes they have already reached a certain level, it will be very difficult for them to improve any further, and, having mistakenly reached this judgment, they will easily become conceited and arrogant. So, timely reminders are critical.

Another student, Ran Qiu, said to Confucius, "Master, it's not that I don't enjoy your teachings, but 'My strength is insufficient'." My abilities are truly lacking."  Confucius told him, "Insufficient strength? What does 'insufficient strength' mean?" It means, "To abandon it halfway." You give up halfway, you don’t have the strength, the ability. But you have not even begun, "Now you are drawing a line." You are limiting yourself by drawing an arbitrary boundary. Your ability is not insufficient; you have not even started. We often haven’t even done something before declaring, "Oh, no, I can't, it’s not going to work!"  Ran Qiu had just this issue, and Confucius immediately pointed it out. Moreover, he also pointed out another issue with Ran Qiu, namely that his desire for the Way was not earnest enough, while he had a great liking for talents and skills; he was thus trapped in his love of talents. Therefore, the *Analects* says, “Young men, you may sound the drums and attack him." When some of Ran Qiu's actions were wrong, Confucius said, you can criticize Ran Qiu.  We can see that when one loves talents and skills, but his heart is not earnestly seeking the Way, the higher his skills, the more likely he will stray from the path. This ties back to what we discussed about the *Zizhi Tongjian* (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Governance), where Sima Guang’s insightful observation was that "Virtue surpassing talent is called a noble person." This idea of limiting oneself, then, shows that one's attitude is incorrect, and we should then immediately “Know their hearts, and then one can remedy their faults.”

Another student, Zilu, happened to be present when Confucius said, "When employed, we act; when dismissed, we withdraw." Confucius was speaking to Yan Hui. The meaning was: If a ruler employs us, then we will practice the great path of rites, music, benevolence and love. "When dismissed, we withdraw;" if no one employs us, we will diligently improve ourselves without being demanding; we will still find joy in the Way. Furthermore, we see that even though Confucius and Yan Hui were not appointed to high political office, their contributions were no less than those in politics.  This is because they compiled the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, established the rites and music, explained the *Book of Changes*, and compiled the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. These works had a huge influence on later generations. Whether there is opportunity or not, they did not demand it. They contributed in ways they could, even without that opportunity. So, when Confucius said this to Yan Hui, we see, even without being employed, we are able to rejoice, to find joy in the Way. We can both do it.

After hearing all this, Zilu interrupted, "Master, if you were leading an army, which disciple would you bring with you?" Confucius seized the opportunity to educate Zilu. "To charge a tiger barehanded or to ford a great river without a boat"—those who are bold with the courage of a common man—I would not go with them, I would not take them along. "I would not go with such people. Instead, I would go with those who approach each task with caution and fear, and who deliberate well before acting." This "fear" means to approach each task with great caution and reverence, and to be very careful. This "deliberate" means to be able to draw on the wisdom of others, to analyze things objectively, and then to make a decision. This is how a humble, cautious person is capable of getting things done, and it’s not through the recklessness of a common man. This is the way Confucius educates his disciples when opportunities arise.

The sixth point is the educational wisdom of "observing each other and thereby becoming better."  "Observing and thereby becoming better is called *mo* (mutual influence)."  It is said, “To speak well of another is good; if people know it, it encourages them further.” In the *Analects*, we see that Confucius praised Emperor Yao, Emperor Yu, and other ancient figures. He praised Guan Zhong, letting his students learn from them.  He praised people of his time, like Yan Pingzhong, who was a contemporary sage, in order that students could emulate him. “To be good in one’s relations, long lasting is the respect,” he said. “Zichan possessed the four qualities of a noble person," citing people of the time so that everyone would try to emulate them.  Furthermore, he cited examples among his students. He said, "There was Yan Hui, who loved learning, who, with only a single bamboo bowl of food and a single gourd of water, lived in a poor lane, where others would not be able to bear the hardship, yet Hui would not change his joy." He wanted all the students to emulate Yan Hui. When we are leading a class, or in charge of a school, we can also cite these outstanding students, these role models, so that everyone can observe each other and become better.

Okay, let's stop here for this session. Thank you everyone!

**Lecture 12: Exemplars for Educators - The Supreme Teacher, Confucius: Part 2 - Confucius's Qualities as a Teacher**

Esteemed guests, respected elders, and fellow alumni, good afternoon.

In our previous session, we discussed how the classic texts reveal the conduct of Master Confucius, which we found to particularly demonstrate the wisdom of his teaching methods. Therefore, we grouped this under the first major aspect of Confucius’s qualities as a teacher: “Wisdom.” The second aspect is “Benevolence,” as wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three universally recognized virtues. “Benevolence” encompasses benevolent virtue, a benevolent heart, and benevolent skills. With a benevolent heart, one then engages in actions that benefit all the people of the world, not only those in the current generation, but also those of future generations. Throughout history, scholars have praised Confucius, saying, "Those who became sages before Confucius," referring to ancient figures who achieved sainthood prior to him, "would not be known without Confucius.” Without Confucius, we would not know their names nor recognize them. This is because, during Confucius’s time, the rituals and music were in decline, and many ancient texts were in danger of being lost, potentially leading to a break in the continuity of our culture. Confucius took on a great responsibility in that era by editing the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents, establishing the proper rituals and music, composing the Spring and Autumn Annals, and expounding upon the principles of the Book of Changes. These important classic texts were all shaped and refined by Confucius. Therefore, for the 2500 years before Confucius, our culture was passed down by these elder figures. "Those who became sages after Confucius," referring to the sages of the 2500 years following him, “would not have a model to follow without Confucius." The word “model” here means to emulate. Later generations all emulated Confucius's spirit, his pursuit of knowledge, and his attitude as a teacher, and thus they became sages. Therefore, Confucius is the one who opened up our 5000 years of culture.

Why could he exert such a long-lasting influence? The key lies in what Confucius himself said and did. He lived by his teachings and that is why his influence is so profound and enduring. An old saying from my own teacher is very insightful: “To do and then speak is to be a sage; to speak and then do it is to be a worthy person; but to speak and not do it is to be a deceiver.” (Loud microphone feedback) My apologies, the next thing I am going to say may be a wake-up call. My teacher can see through the actions of a sage. Why have Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Sakyamuni Buddha influenced humankind for thousands of years? Because they all lived according to what they taught. Therefore, people do not have any doubt about their words. Thus, the foundation of benevolence and its ability to benefit countless generations lies in leading by example. Confucius said in *The Great Learning,* “Those of ancient times who wished to manifest their clear virtue throughout the world," meaning those who wished to benefit all people, "first cultivated their own person, from the Son of Heaven down to the common people." He truly cultivated himself and set an example. Only then could he produce such a transformative educational effect.

Confucius’s leading by example is evident in a conversation he had with Zengzi. Zengzi stated that he had heard three things said about Confucius’s conduct, but he himself had not yet been able to follow them. First, "The Master would see one good deed in a person and forget their many wrongdoings.” Upon seeing one good quality in someone, he would acknowledge and affirm that quality, not allowing their flaws or past mistakes to become a prejudice in his mind. This is called magnanimity; this is giving others confidence. “Look at the second half of a person's life; a prodigal son who turns back is priceless." If someone has made mistakes in the past, and we don't give them a chance to change, we are cutting off their path forward. This is called harshness. Constantly belittling and negating them might cause them to become desperate, to give up on themselves, and possibly degenerate, all because of our total rejection of them.

Therefore, the feeling evoked by an encouraging look of trust is worlds apart from that of a disapproving look of doubt. Can we accumulate merit through how we view others? If we approach people with an attitude of trust and confidence, then simply looking at them inspires them. This is accumulating merit. However, if we view others with suspicion and negativity, thinking, “Hmph, you’re no good,” our gaze can cause internal damage; this is creating negative karma.

On our path of self-cultivation, even changing one habit requires constant effort. Thus, there is also a process of familiarization with a new device (referring to the microphone issue earlier), so please forgive us for any inconvenience. True self-cultivation is not something that only emperors and generals can achieve. A general may not fear death, but tell him not to drink alcohol or to control his temper, and it will be unbearable for him. It is not easy to change habits. Changing a habit is like peeling off a layer of skin, one layer at a time. It is a painful process, but once the skin is removed, one’s body and mind become light and at ease, and one is no longer a slave to one’s habits.

Zengzi said about Confucius’s conduct: “To see one good deed in a person and forget their many wrongdoings is easy for the Master.” It was easy for him to change his perception of others, and he didn’t harbor any biases. If you genuinely correct your behavior, he would affirm and praise you, and be happy for you. Furthermore, this “easy” (事, *shi*) also means that he was easy to get along with, easy to serve, and his presence felt like a warm spring breeze. If we are always judgmental and prejudiced towards others, we will unconsciously create pressure for them.

The second aspect of Confucius’s conduct: “To see the goodness in others as if it were his own.” Seeing the good qualities and achievements of others was a source of joy for him, as if they were his own accomplishments. This is to rejoice in the merit of others, without the slightest bit of jealousy. He would even actively promote it. “To speak well of others is to do good.” “This is the Master’s lack of contentiousness.” He did not compete with others to be seen as superior and wasn't arrogant. He always saw the good qualities of others and rejoiced in them. In fact, why are there so many conflicts in organizations and among people today? It's because people cannot bear to see others succeed and resort to slander, instead of appreciating them.

Third, “Upon hearing of good teachings, he would personally practice them, and only then would he teach them, embodying the Master's diligence.” When he heard a good teaching or saw good actions, he would personally put it into practice. Once he experienced it for himself, he would then, as someone who had gone through it, guide his students to do the same. Thus, each of his teachings was something he first put into practice himself. In order to benefit his students sooner, he was diligent and vigorous in improving himself. This is “diligence,” his relentless efforts to improve himself, which were fueled by his benevolence and desire to benefit others.

When we reflect on this teaching, we should adopt an attitude of emulating Confucius by first working on ourselves. For example, if we wish to advise others not to be greedy, angry, or ignorant, we must first subdue these qualities within ourselves. If we do not do this, we may appear to be promoting the Way, but in fact, we may be obstructing it. If we preach about the dangers of greed, yet we ourselves are growing more attached to material comforts, people will see our double standards, and this would not only fail to promote the Way but would also cause people to doubt the teachings of the sages, thus slandering the Dharma. Therefore, one of the advantages of being a teacher in a school is that it motivates self-improvement. For instance, if you explain a principle and it reaches thirty-five students, as the teacher in charge, I am one person observing thirty-five, and they are thirty-five pairs of eyes looking at me. For instance, if you teach “Be trustworthy in all your words," the students will be watching, thinking, "Teacher, you said this last time, how come you haven’t done it yet?” This is pressure; it makes you sweat. However, being a teacher in a school is not a pressure, but a blessing. Why? Because there is no turning back. You must forge ahead. Otherwise, you will mislead these children and cause them to lose faith in themselves and in the teachings of the sages. Therefore, everything is a good thing if you look at it with awareness and a sense of responsibility.

Next, the second manifestation of benevolence is “Patience.” Just as in the character for “education” (教 - *jiao*). On the left, we see two X's, and below them a small child; on the right, a hand holding a tree branch. The two X's on the left represent teaching by example. Parents and teachers mark the first X, and children, through subtle influence, emulate this by marking the second X – like attracts like, a good example. On the right, the hand holds a branch, representing patience – tirelessly and earnestly giving instructions. Frankly speaking, without patience, there is no real sincerity. True things do not change; what changes is false. Therefore, whether we are sincere or not is not just what we say; it depends on whether we have an unchanging, unwavering love for others until the end. Have you all heard the song, “The True Meaning of Love”? The most important part of this song is the last line. Why? Because the last line is drawn out and long: “Love never fails.” “Never fails” has to be drawn out and long because it represents enduring love, whereas love that doesn’t last is just a pretense. If people marry in the morning and divorce in the afternoon, that is not true love but lust.

How do we see Confucius’s patience? Confucius demonstrated in *The Analects* that he was "tireless in learning and tireless in teaching." In the *Record of Education* (學記) in the *Record of Rites* (*Liji*), there is a very important teaching method called "guiding but not pulling, encouraging but not suppressing, inspiring but not fully revealing." This is a teaching method that "harmonizes, eases, and stimulates reflection." It is about guiding him, not letting him feel like you are dragging him forward, but rather making him feel that it is inviting and interesting so that he is naturally attracted to it, rather than forced. “Guiding but not pulling makes for harmony.” He accepts it with great joy and harmony. “Encouraging” is about motivating him; “encouraging but not suppressing.” What is suppressing? It means negating or suppressing him, which would be detrimental. One should constantly encourage their faith and good intention. “Encouraging but not suppressing makes learning easy.” The learning becomes easy and joyful, rather than painful or forced. “Inspiring but not fully revealing stimulates reflection." “Inspiring” means to awaken them. However, “fully revealing” is not to simply give them the full answer and block their path to enlightenment. That would be like cramming for a test. You should use an approach that inspires them, point out key things, and allow them to naturally think and understand. You should not pressure them. If you keep pressuring them, they will think, “Here it comes again, more nagging and preaching.” The teaching method that “harmonizes, eases, and stimulates reflection” suggests that by inspiring but not fully revealing, they will naturally begin to think.

After having learned about the teaching method in the *Record of Education*, you can see that educating a student well requires great patience. This teaching method reminds us of something my teacher said when reading *Liaofan's Four Lessons*, especially about the encounter between Mr. Yuan Liaofan and Chan Master Yungu. He said that in the past, monks were well-versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. They were learned and excellent teachers, which is why the saying, "One does not visit the Three Jewels Hall without a reason,” came about. When the common people encountered difficult problems, whom did they turn to? They went to the Three Jewels Hall to consult the Dharma masters, who were knowledgeable and had passed the national examinations to be ordained. The level of this ordination was comparable to the rank of a “*jinshi*” (進士, successful candidate of the highest imperial examination). Moreover, they had pure hearts, and they could relinquish worldly desires. A pure heart gives rise to wisdom. Therefore, one can see that Chan Master Yungu was an excellent teacher. In his brief interaction with Mr. Yuan Liaofan, he demonstrated the teaching method of "harmonizing, easing, and stimulating reflection" to its fullest.

For example, in guiding others, what did he use? He used the most familiar language. For instance, if you talk to a friend or relative about traditional culture, and they have never read the *Analects*, and you start with “Confucius said, Confucius said,” one sentence after another, they will be completely overwhelmed. However, if your friend is a farmer, you can say to him, “As you sow, so shall you reap,” and he would immediately agree. You use what they understand to guide them, and they will resonate with you, therefore, “guiding but not pulling” is very important.

We mentioned earlier the teaching method of Chan Master Yungu. The circumstances surrounding the encounter were that Mr. Yuan Liaofan sat facing Chan Master Yungu for three days without any stray thoughts arising. Chan Master Yungu asked him, "Why do you not have any stray thoughts?" He replied, "My fate has long been predetermined. It hasn’t changed in decades. What is there for me to think about?" Chan Master Yungu laughed and said, "I thought you were a hero, but it turns out you’re just an ordinary person." This “laugh” also piqued his curiosity. One should laugh when it is appropriate. "Can fate be changed?" You see, the dialogue is captivating. Can fate be changed? Chan Master Yungu said, "People cannot be without a self-centered mind." If one is unable to let go of self-interest and ego, they will "forever be bound by Yin and Yang," and their fate will be fixed. But, importantly, he continues, "Those who accumulate virtue and good deeds" have "a fate that is not fixed." If you were Mr. Liaofan, how would you feel when you heard this statement? “Oh, there is hope.” This is "encouraging but not suppressing." Through this conversation, his faith and motivation are gradually being ignited. Have you encountered someone like this? For example, a cultivated person meets someone who appears gloomy, and after half an hour of conversation, they leave with a brightened countenance. This shows the power of a great teacher. Mr. Liaofan spent decades thinking his fate could not be changed; however, after this guidance, he immediately vowed to complete three thousand good deeds. This shows the strong teaching ability of Chan Master Yungu. Naturally, when we truly understand this, we can use it skillfully.

Chan Master Yungu also told him that for the past twenty years, his fate had been completely predetermined, without the slightest change; of course, he is an ordinary person. Then Mr. Liaofan became curious, “Can fate be changed?” Master Yungu then said, “Fate is created by oneself, and blessings are sought by oneself. As the classics say, these are clear instructions.” Which scholar had not read the *Book of Odes* and the *Book of Documents*? All of them have read these books, and they all know that fate is created by oneself, and blessings are sought by oneself. Have you all realized that even though they have read these books, the books remain just books, and they remain the same? Therefore, it always depends on the circumstances. He met Chan Master Yungu and, “Bang,” that sentence really struck him. "Oh, that’s right, I know all of this, but I never put it into practice. It is possible to change.” Moreover, it was something that he was very familiar with. First, he mentioned the classics, and then he gave teachings from Sakyamuni. This helps us understand the social background of that time. Scholars were well-versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. This has been the basis of our culture for over two thousand years. Chan Master Yungu then also mentioned, “In our Buddhist teachings, ‘If one seeks wealth and honor, one obtains wealth and honor; if one seeks sons and daughters, one obtains sons and daughters; if one seeks longevity, one obtains longevity.’” Lying is a serious offense in Buddhism. How could Sakyamuni Buddha and the Bodhisattvas lie?

As a result, after hearing this, Mr. Liaofan showed that he was truly commendable, and he immediately asked for guidance. Some people have doubts, keep them to themselves, and overthink without speaking up. He proactively asked for guidance, which is in accordance with the *Standards for Students*: “If in your mind you hold a doubt, Write it down, make sure of it, and find it out.” He had been misunderstanding the classics for decades. He said, "Didn't Mencius say, ‘If you seek it, you will obtain it. It is seeking within oneself.’" I can strive for moral virtues. Reputation and wealth are external things; how can they be sought? You see, he had this question in his mind for a long time. Therefore, is it easy to implement the *Standards for Students*? "If in your mind you hold a doubt, write it down."

Chan Master Yungu told him that Mencius was correct, but he had misunderstood it himself. “Have you not seen what the Sixth Patriarch said?” The *Platform Sutra* and the *Diamond Sutra* had been read by scholars for over two thousand years. The *Platform Sutra* states, "All fields of blessings are not apart from the square inch." What does the field of blessing depend on? It depends on the cultivation of one’s heart. How can one not obtain a blessing? “Seeking it from the heart,” from the fundamental heart, “all things can be attained.” “Seeking it from within not only leads to moral virtues, but also reputation and wealth. One attains both internal and external blessings.” “This type of seeking is beneficial to obtaining." Once you understand these principles, you must cultivate your heart and mind. However, “if you do not reflect on yourself and examine your inner being but instead seek things externally,” such as seeking to become an official or befriending a rich person, “even if you seek with a method, you are subject to fate.” You will not attain your goals, because you have not addressed the root cause. Your efforts will be futile, and you will “lose both internally and externally.” If you only seek outwardly, driven by greed, you will not accumulate virtues. Without accumulating blessings, you will not obtain anything. “Each benefits from their own cultivation.” Giving wealth leads to wealth; giving the Dharma leads to wisdom; and giving fearlessness leads to health and longevity. How could you possibly obtain these blessings by worshipping deities? One can only obtain these blessings by seeking them through proper means.

After explaining the principles, Chan Master Yungu asked him, “Tell me, what kind of fate did Master Confucius predict for you? Can you tell me?” "I will tell you the truth,” Mr. Liaofan replied, honestly revealing everything he knew about his predicted fate. Then, Chan Master Yungu said something very important. This is what we call “inspiring but not fully revealing,” prompting him to think without directly feeding him the answer. After listening, Chan Master Yungu asked him, “Think for yourself, should you obtain a prestigious official rank?” Because he had said that according to his fate, he wouldn't obtain an official rank and would not have a son. Could he reflect on whether or not he deserved such things? This question served as an "inspiring but not fully revealing” moment. “I considered it for a long time,” Mr. Liaofan said. He reflected and considered for a long time, and then he said, "I should not.” He admitted it himself.

If a friend were to say, “My fate is like this,” and we were to say, “Yeah, you are a harsh person, that’s why you don’t have children,” would he accept it? He might think, “Am I that bad?” If you point out eight faults, he would think he only has five, and he would stop listening to you. But see, Chan Master Yungu clearly saw through his situation and let him think for himself. He admitted it himself, which makes the understanding more profound. Even now, when our parents or virtuous teachers and elders point out our shortcomings, "Oh, you're not so good at this, that," and we often think, "Am I really that bad? I'm not that bad, am I?" and we might not be so accepting.

After settling down and reflecting, Mr. Liaofan then reflected, saying, "I should not." Those who achieve a prestigious official rank appear to be blessed. However, he was born with few blessings and did not make great efforts to accumulate merit and cultivate his own blessings. “Furthermore, I am impatient with troubles.” That means he is prone to outbursts and anger, and he is also intolerant of others. It was difficult for him to continue speaking, as it seemed he was speaking about himself. “At times, I would use my talents to belittle others.” These mindsets and behaviors diminish his blessings. “I am too straightforward and direct.” This means that he speaks without considering the circumstances and without understanding how others feel. He speaks bluntly, and they go home feeling hurt for three days. “I speak carelessly and recklessly." He often likes to speak big theories without thinking about whether they are correct or not. He is arrogant. "All of these are the marks of one who has little good fortune." Therefore, he would not be able to achieve a prestigious official rank.

He also analyzed why he did not have any children, stating, “The filthy earth teems with life, while clear water often has no fish.” He was too clean, killing all the ants and cockroaches. He was too obsessed with cleanliness and might have harmed lives. One must understand that all living beings have sentience, and communication is possible with sincerity. You can ask them to move away; you can put out some food outside and ask them to go eat, without harming them. “All beings are interconnected.” All beings are sentient. How can we communicate with them? Through sincerity and loyalty. Sincerity is genuineness; loyalty is doing your best to benefit them, and then a connection is formed. When our teacher first arrived in Australia, there were groups of ants. By sincerely treating them well, they ended up not disturbing each other. Therefore, Mr. Liaofan realized his lack of children was due to his excessive cleanliness.

Secondly, "A harmonious spirit nurtures all living things, yet I am prone to anger," meaning that he had a bad temper and was therefore “unfit to have children." “Love is the source of life, and intolerance is the root of barrenness.” One should always cherish others, consider them, and nurture them, like how Heaven and Earth nurture all living things, allowing many lives to grow. However, “intolerance” is cruel and harmful to life. “I am overly concerned with my own reputation and am unable to sacrifice myself to save others, therefore, I am unfit to have children.” “Excessive talking drains one's energy.” He often talked too much, which drained his energy and “made him unfit to have children.” “I enjoy drinking, which depletes my essence." He would drink until midnight, and staying up late, he was “unfit to have children.” “I enjoy sitting up all night." This is also a harmful habit, "not knowing how to preserve his energy and spirit," causing harm to his health, and therefore, “making him unfit to have children.” I imagine his parents would have been worried about these habits, and causing his parents worry is also a form of diminishing one’s blessings and filial piety. He exposed all of his problems and admitted to them himself.

Mr. Liaofan also commendably stated, "I have many other faults that I cannot list here.” He admitted that he had only listed a few. How can one change one’s fate? "Changing bad habits is the foundation for establishing one’s destiny." By changing bad habits, one can then change one's fate. One must stop deceiving oneself, acknowledge one’s mistakes, and correct them. I believe that upon hearing his self-reflection and repentance, Chan Master Yungu must have felt, "This youth is teachable.”


Okay, here's a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow suitable for a general audience. I've paid attention to the nuances and tried to convey the original meaning as precisely as possible:

**Translation:**

Therefore, everyone shouldn’t view these interactions as a given. If Mr. Liaofan hadn’t reflected on himself, this connection might have ended there. These connections developed naturally, brought about by a heart of respect and sincerity. When a person reflects on themselves, that sincerity naturally flows out. Have you ever seen someone reflecting on their lack of filial piety towards their parents, shedding tears, and we, watching, also shedding tears? This is heartfelt empathy.

Following this, Zen Master Yun Gu further solidified his correct understanding and faith. “Yun Gu said: ‘It’s not just about passing the imperial examinations.”’ It’s not only about seeking academic success.  “One who enjoys a thousand gold’s worth of property is definitely a person worthy of a thousand gold,” because they have cultivated that much merit and good fortune. “One who enjoys a hundred gold’s worth of property is definitely a person worthy of a hundred gold.” “Those who are destined to die of starvation,” whose fate is lacking in blessings, ultimately starve to death because they haven’t cultivated good fortune themselves. This is because "destiny is created by me, and blessings are sought by oneself.” Heaven follows this natural law; it absolutely doesn’t have some specific intention. It's just like giving birth to children. "Those who have a hundred generations of virtue will surely have a hundred generations of descendants to protect them,” like the descendants of Confucius. "Those who have ten generations of virtue will surely have ten generations of descendants to protect them,” like the descendants of Mr. Lin Zexu. These are all proofs. "Those who have virtue for three or two generations will surely have descendants to protect them for three or two generations." "Those who are cut off without descendants," meaning they have no children, "have extremely shallow virtue," meaning they lack good fortune.

The most typical example of this in history is from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period: “Dou Yanshan had a righteous method of education, teaching his five sons, all of whom became famous.” He was originally destined to have no sons. His grandfather advised him, and he listened, actively cutting off evil and cultivating goodness. In the end, he had five sons, all of whom were very accomplished. He lived until his eighties and died peacefully without any illness. He took a bath, said good-bye to people, and then passed away. No suffering from illness, truly wonderful! "Saints and sages can be cultivated through consistent effort.” If we accumulate merit and virtue now, we will definitely have this kind of good fortune.

Then, Zen Master Yun Gu told Mr. Liaofan that now that he knew his faults, he should quickly "completely reform and correct" those bad habits that prevented him from achieving academic success and having children. He should repent, make a vow to change, and then remember to accumulate virtue. Remember to have a broad mind, remember to be kind and gentle to others, and remember not to waste one's body and spirit. He pointed out all of his problems. "All that was before is as if dead yesterday; all that is to come is as if born today.” When you read this sentence, do you feel energized? "This principle is a rebirth of the spiritual self." "Even the physical body has limitations; the spiritual self," which you create today by cutting off evil, cultivating good, and following the teachings of the sages, "how could it not move Heaven?" It can definitely move and change destiny. As *Shangshu* says, "Tai Jia said: 'Heaven-sent misfortune can still be avoided; self-made misfortune, there is no way to live through.'" So your current destiny is of this life. As long as you are willing to put in the effort, you can definitely change it.  It also says, "The *Book of Poetry* says: 'Always align with destiny, seek much happiness for yourself.'" Did you see these words, quoting from classic texts?  "Encourage without suppressing” was to build his confidence and help him see that "faith is the root of the path and the mother of merit.” His faith was completely firm, certain that he could accomplish it.

Have you noticed that Mr. Liaofan did not doubt after returning home? There's much more discussed later, including the *Book of Changes*: “Families that accumulate good deeds will surely have overflowing blessings.” And practically speaking, Zen Master Yun Gu was truly good to the end, "seeing him off until the West,” by giving him a chart of merits and demerits, showing him exactly how to practice. His compassion reached its utmost. Okay, you can see the more exciting parts yourself. You can all read this part carefully tonight. This is an example of a good teacher, just like Confucius, tirelessly teaching. The saying goes: “Compassion is the foundation, and skillful means are the door,” “leading without pulling, encouraging without suppressing, revealing without forcing.” All of these are skillful methods. This is the second point: patience.

The third point is that he taught everyone without discrimination. He demonstrated Confucius’s benevolence, teaching everyone who was willing to learn with all his heart. In the *Analects*, it is said, “From those who come with the most modest gift of ten pieces of dried meat, I have never withheld my teachings.” The “ten pieces of dried meat” was the gift for becoming a disciple. Historically, it wasn’t an expensive item, not a particularly valuable gift. This shows that Confucius valued what? The respect in becoming a disciple, the ritual, rather than how expensive the gift was. This ritual cannot be abandoned, because one point of sincerity and respect will bring one point of benefit, ten points of sincerity and respect will bring ten points of benefit, and ten thousand points of sincerity and respect will bring ten thousand points of benefit. If one doesn’t even have respect for a teacher, then that connection will not be complete. Therefore, as long as they respectfully went through the rituals of becoming a disciple, Confucius would definitely teach them wholeheartedly.

There’s another example in the *Analects*, in the “Shu Er Chapter Seven.” A child from Huxiang came seeking to study. The customs of Huxiang were not good, and the people were very difficult to teach. As a result, this child came to Confucius for learning. Confucius’s disciples raised a question: “The people from that place are very bad by nature. Teacher, teaching him may be a waste of your time and energy." Confucius’s reply emphasized: “Today he comes to me, which means he wants to improve. He cherishes himself. Of course, I should respond by helping him improve himself. Since he is being so self-respecting, why would you refuse him? I can only be sure that at this moment he wants to learn, and is learning wholeheartedly. As for what he will be like in the future, that is not something I can control. I will just cherish this current connection.” He deeply valued connections, even if it just happened that for a few days, his good roots had emerged and he was willing to learn; Confucius would still teach him with all his effort.

In “Shu Er Chapter Seven,” there is another sentence that allows us to understand what it means to teach without discrimination: offering everything without holding anything back. One day, Confucius said to his disciples, “Do you, my students, think I am keeping anything secret?” Perhaps he could see what his students were thinking. Perhaps some students thought, "Is there something the teacher isn't teaching us, holding back a bit?" This was the beginning of doubt. Confucius saw it, and although the students didn't say it, he needed to dispel the doubt so that they could benefit. So he told his disciples, "Do you think I am holding anything back? I absolutely am not holding anything back. I am telling you everything in its entirety.” Actually, Confucius was someone who was promoting the Way. How could he not want every one of his disciples to have the true knowledge and to be of service to the world? Why would he hold anything back?

Although Confucius said this, there were still a very small number of students who couldn't get rid of their doubts. For example, one student named Chen Kang had this doubt, but his doubt was "biased but in the right direction." The doubt was a problem; it was biased, but because of his doubt, he suspected that Confucius had something hidden, so he went to ask Confucius's son, Kong Li. So this conversation is a conversation that makes people better understand the selflessness and fairness of a sage. So his doubt was "biased but in the right direction"; he also had merit for that, because it was a good deed motivated by a flawed thought.  He went to ask Confucius's son, did your father teach you anything privately? Kong Li said, "No. We all study together. There were only two times: once when I was walking through the courtyard and my father called me over, 'Have you studied the Book of Poetry?' He said that 'Without studying the *Book of Poetry*, one cannot speak well.'"  Poetry allows people to be gentle and kind, so that with a kind heart, one's words will not hurt others, but be kind and honest. So, he said, that is why one must study poetry.  Another time, when I was walking through the courtyard, my father saw me and called me over, saying, "'Have you studied rituals?' 'Without studying rituals, one cannot establish oneself.'" One must know how to conduct oneself in all situations and show respect to others; otherwise it is very difficult to get along with people, very difficult to gain a foothold in society. So one must study rituals.  After hearing this, I retreated and studied rituals, and these were the only two times. Chen Kang then thought: "The importance of studying poetry and ritual has already been emphasized in the curriculum, so he did not teach his son anything extra."  I gained three things from asking this: I learned the importance of studying poetry, the importance of studying ritual, and I learned that a noble person has no selfish thoughts, and is not particularly good to his son. It showed that he valued "keeping his son at a distance", maintaining fair and equal love.

This example gives us a very good insight. Actually, when I read this part, I understood it very deeply. For example, I was once taught by Uncle Lu. From these elders, we see that they cultivate the younger generation with a responsibility to carry forward the teachings of the sages. This cultivation is even greater than what they give to their own children, and I have personally experienced this. Why? Because they have the welfare of all people in mind. Their sons may not necessarily be more receptive than others who have vowed to fulfill a mission. Therefore, whoever is willing to be taught, they will give their all. The last time we went to seek guidance from an elder, he spoke continuously for seven or eight hours, even forgetting to go to the bathroom. Really, from morning until night, only then did we realize that we had not gone to the bathroom all day. We took several colleagues to seek guidance from the elder, and it truly could be called a pouring out of his heart and soul.

So, this is "teaching without discrimination." Confucius had this spirit. We can experience it from our teachers and from the good and wise people we are close to. I have also shared with everyone that once our teacher donated a significant amount of money to the China Children and Teenagers' Fund at the Great Hall of the People, hoping that ethical and moral teachings could be broadcast in all communities. When the donation ceremony ended, we were eating in the Mongolian Hall, which is very large, and the dining table was very long. I was deeply impressed. The elder sat in the middle, talking about Chinese culture. At first, the guests were all talking amongst themselves. Some were reporters, some were professors, all very high-ranking people in society. The elder spoke eloquently, introducing traditional culture. Before long, it was a miracle; everyone stopped talking and just stared at the elder, listening to him speak. That heart of benefiting others moved people who were meeting him for the first time. Teaching everyone without discrimination, even grasping any opportunity.  That Mongolian Hall was so big, and speaking required a lot of energy, but he was willing to exhaust his own energy to seize every opportunity for others to hear the teachings of the sages.

The fourth point is embracing the welfare of all under Heaven. We see in Confucius's “The Great Harmony” section in the “Ritual Record”: “When the Great Way prevails, the world is shared by all. The virtuous and capable are chosen, trust and harmony are emphasized.” Confucius’s whole life was a striving for this goal. When talking with students about their ambitions, one time he asked Zi Lu and Yan Hui to share their ambitions. Zi Lu said, “If I become wealthy, or if I possess certain items, 'I wish to have my carriages and horses and warm fur coats shared with my friends.'”  All his friends could borrow them, and he wouldn’t mind if his belongings were used and damaged. What is mine is everyone's, and what is everyone's is still everyone's.  I suppose that should be the logic. If we said, "What is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine," then people would be worried. "What is mine is yours, but what is yours is still yours." Be strict with oneself, not demanding of others. We do this because we feel that righteousness is an attitude that a person should have, and we feel that way without expecting others to do the same.

Next, Yan Hui said, “I wish not to boast of my merits, nor to trouble others with my labor.”  "Not boasting of one's merits" means that when one dedicates themselves, they don't mention it or try to take credit. They can even give credit to others, and to the leaders. This is the attitude that high-ranking officials should have, like the ministers of a country. “Not troubling others with my labor” means that one should put oneself in the place of the people.  If you have them working on public works during busy farming season, they would miss planting time and will have no food to eat and will starve. This is the attitude that a ruler should have, to show care and consideration. This was Yan Hui's ambition.

Then, Zi Lu asked Confucius what his ambition was. Confucius said, “To bring peace to the elderly, to be trusted by friends, and to be cherished by the young.” If our society moved in this direction now, many problems would gradually be solved. To make the elderly, and our parents, peaceful, with a comfortable life, many problems of the elderly could gradually be overcome. "To be trusted by friends," if people have trust and righteousness, many conflicts and problems would disappear. This also includes husband and wife, siblings, who should also practice righteousness, and these family problems would not exist. “To be cherished by the young,” to properly cultivate the next generation, then the nation and the country would have a bright future. Now, the juvenile crime rate is getting higher and higher all over the world. The whole world is considering how to improve this problem. Therefore, the wisdom of Confucius's education is so crucial for our time. This speaks of embracing the welfare of all under Heaven.

We even feel that even a sigh from Confucius was meant to awaken those who were confused. That sigh awakens our sense of shame. For example, Confucius said, “It’s all over! I have not seen one who is able to see their own faults and then reflect on them inwardly.”  “It’s all over” is a lament, a sigh. Alas, if we students made Confucius sigh often, then we would be at fault. Where are people’s good roots and good fortune cultivated? Filial piety and respect for teachers. If we are causing our teachers to shake their heads and worry, this is not proper. Confucius lamented, if Confucius were lamenting right in front of us, we should really be ashamed and kowtow in repentance; that is how we can sincerely show filial piety to our teacher.

Confucius said that he has not seen someone who could see their own faults, and see one's faults, is to be aware of one's faults. Then comes, "reflect on them inwardly" which means to correct oneself; this is called repentance. It is not only knowing, but also repenting.  Many people say "I know", but you can tell that they haven't truly repented. They haven't fully understood that their mistakes have truly hurt themselves and hurt many others. So we see that those who genuinely repent from the heart feel regret and shed tears. That is very natural.  But repentance is not just crying, and then the faults are gone. You still have to put in real effort, with resilience, to subdue and change them.  Confucius spoke about seeing faults as knowing them, and reflecting on them inwardly as repentance, and that’s not even to the stage of changing one's faults. Being able to see and repent is already extremely difficult.  That means that if Confucius were to say this to us, it’s very likely that our behavior would be squandering Confucius’s teachings, and we would not be honest, obedient, or truly practice them. Does Confucius’s heart understand this? Of course. He is someone who has been through the practice of self-cultivation, so he understands it. Therefore, if a person truly changes, they will make their parents worry less, make their teachers worry less, and make their leaders worry less. This sigh, a timeless sigh, we hope we do not let Confucius sigh in vain. Let us be people who truly change their faults, and “when we make a mistake, do not fear changing it.”

Confucius also lamented, "It’s all over! I have not seen one who loves virtue as much as they love beauty," as though it is very difficult to see the level of enthusiasm for learning that exceeds the level of enthusiasm for beautiful women. I remember when we first arrived in Haikou, and we were conducting a class, that, on the day we were teaching, there was a worldwide beauty pageant being held in Haikou and Sanya. Some of the local fellow students were struggling: should they go to class or should they go watch the beauty pageant? It happened to be that day. Confucius’s words, “I have not seen one who loves virtue as much as they love beauty,” reminded us of our priorities. Confucius also reminded us that “food and sex are among the greatest of human desires.” The desire for sex should be restricted and controlled, not indulged, and the desire for food should also be controlled. When we see how people cannot control their three-inch tongue, it's causing the earth to collapse. These are important reminders.

Actually, to be honest, when a person truly changes their faults, and their wisdom and spirituality are elevated, then their desires will naturally decrease, and it is not something forced. Therefore, as long as we truly make the resolution and gradually put in effort, it will naturally come to fruition. Why? Because those habits “are inherently nonexistent.” They were originally not there, and they can definitely be eliminated. Does a child have these desires?  They were not originally there, and can definitely be put down. “The original nature is inherently present.”  Our bright virtue and original goodness are inherently present, and we can definitely restore them. "Be lenient with your deadlines, but work hard, when your effort is sufficient, stagnation will be overcome."

These are a few of the laments from Confucius. It suddenly reminds me of a sigh from our teacher, when he said, “If Chinese culture is lost in our hands, then we will have let down our ancestors and the sages!” This lament from our teacher made us feel extremely ashamed, and our sense of shame was awakened by this lament. Therefore, Confucius, and also our teacher, these sages who have the welfare of all under Heaven at heart, even their laments are an expression of their compassionate hearts, meant to inspire us. Just like today, your father, out of disappointment, speaks to you for a long time, and when you don’t listen, he scolds you. You should understand that your father is hurting himself, but he wants to awaken you, and you must treasure the kindness of your father.  If you don’t even treasure the kindness of your parents, sooner or later your good fortune will be depleted because you lack the root of good fortune. “Parents are the root source of their children," if you don’t show consideration for your parents and are unfilial, then you have lost the very root and source of your being.

Next, the third key point of Confucius's manner as a teacher is "courage." "Wisdom, benevolence, and courage," courage is one of the three virtues. First, courage is shown in correcting one's faults. Confucius emphasized, "When we make a mistake, do not fear changing it.” “Do not fear” means that we should not worry or be afraid; we should have the courage to correct our faults. We see in the *Three Character Classic*, “In the past, Zhongni (Confucius) studied under Xiang Tuo. Ancient sages and wise men also studied diligently.” Confucius was a sage, and when he encountered a child who talked about something he didn’t understand, he asked him for advice.  Does this require courage? Sometimes when we are older or have a high position, it requires courage not to be ashamed to ask those below us. The “below” refers to humility. “Below” refers to, even if one’s position and age are high, yet one’s heart for seeking the truth is so ardent, that when one encounters a younger person who understands a truth that one does not, one humbly asks them with respect, without any hindrances.  So, as the “Teacher’s Discourse” says, “Where the Way exists, there the teacher exists,” “In learning the Way, there is a first and a last. In specialization, there is a focus.” As long as someone understands something that we do not, and we are willing to learn, we should ask them with great respect. When that child gives feedback on our shortcomings, we should immediately acknowledge them and immediately correct them. This shows courage in the process of correcting one's faults.

And to be honest, correcting one fault is not easy. We see many scholars who have spent twenty years to change one of their bad tempers. They spent twenty years of effort. “The ancients pursued learning without sparing their strength, and the fruits of youth ripen in old age; Knowledge gained from books always feels superficial; understanding will only come through actual practice.” To counter our temper, we must also put in a lot of hard work, and even have to become more and more resilient.  “Oh, I reminded myself not to get angry, but here it comes again!” Therefore, for those of us working in education, self-education and self-observation are very important. What do we observe?  Where does our temper come from?  To catch thieves, you must first catch their leader. Where is that leader?  Anger is often connected to greedy desires. When one cannot get what one wants, one becomes angry. If a person is not greedy, and does not care about face, then they will not get angry or become embarrassed and angry. When a person is about to get angry, as long as they calmly observe their thoughts, they will definitely be able to find the root of the anger. If you don’t eliminate the roots, then they will grow again in the spring.  We also have to remind ourselves that once you lose your temper, it is very difficult to repair the damage. After you lose your temper, a five-year friendship may never recover, a significant loss. After losing one’s temper, one will lose their authority in the group, and it will be difficult to cooperate in work in the future. Therefore, enduring a moment of anger will prevent a hundred days of sorrow. "All things are accomplished through patience.”  If one can't be patient, then one’s cultivation will be lost, the trust and harmony between people will be lost. It hinders oneself and it hinders others. This is not right.

This part we will talk more about in the seventh major section, “The Importance of Self-Education,” we will first bring to a close the sixth major section today, “Learning from Confucius.” So it is normal to have mistakes. No one hears the classics and immediately becomes a sage. There are extremely few in history. Among them there was one sage who was most special, the Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng. He only listened to the Fifth Patriarch speak half of the *Diamond Sutra*, and as he spoke he immediately let go of attachments and differentiations, and he instantly attained enlightenment.  This showed the utmost sincerity and respect! As soon as he heard, he immediately followed the text into contemplation, immediately transforming himself, immediately practicing the teachings, and immediately becoming a sage. The mummified body of the Sixth Patriarch is still there today.

The second point of courage is that the first is to correct faults, the second is to take on responsibility. This is called taking on responsibilities bravely. "Since ancient times, no one has lived without dying, let me leave behind a loyal heart to shine in the pages of history." When we mention this, we are very grateful to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In 2013, at the opening ceremony of the spring semester at the Central Party School, he encouraged everyone to have the spirit of dedication of "Since ancient times, no one has lived without dying, let me leave behind a loyal heart to shine in the pages of history." This includes the spirit of “exerting every effort and continuing to the last breath.”


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for a professional and natural tone, while preserving the original meaning and nuance:

**Translation:**

We must possess the spirit of "though in a humble position, never forgetting to worry about the nation." Even as ordinary citizens, we should always be concerned about the development of our country and our people. President Xi also expects those in positions of power to emulate Fan Zhongyan’s broad-mindedness, "to be the first to worry about the world’s troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures," as well as Lin Zexu’s patriotic devotion, "if it benefits the nation, I shall risk my life, how can I avoid it for fear of personal fortune or misfortune?” This model of virtue is from Mr. Lin Zexu of the Qing Dynasty, a time not so far removed from our own. We believe that when a nation is on the rise, auspicious signs will surely appear. If our national leaders have this sense of responsibility, then we, as ordinary citizens, must also share this responsibility. Especially having heard the teachings of the sages and being willing to delve into deeper learning, then "continuing the lost learning of the past sages" becomes our shared responsibility and mission.

In the *Analects*, it is said that when Confucius faced life-threatening danger, he was fearless because he understood Heaven's mandate. He knew, "The continuity of Chinese cultural tradition has to be passed down through me, no one can harm me," and carried that responsibility. Confucius said, "While Heaven has not yet abandoned this culture," and this culture is the tradition of our culture, "what can the people of Kuang do to me?” The people of Kuang cannot harm me. Therefore, if we have this determination and make this vow, a short life can become a long one. Indeed, where does transforming one’s destiny begin? It begins with broadening our hearts. When we take the world as our responsibility, our destiny will change.

Courage, the third point, is expressed in setting aspirations. Many people think, "Ah, it’s enough for me to have enough to eat and live in peace." We must set great aspirations. “The void is not vast, the heart is the king; diamond is not strong, the power of the vow is the strongest." One's heart and aspirations should be as vast as the void and firmer and unchangeable than a diamond. Wang Yangming of the Ming Dynasty said, "Without setting aspirations, nothing in the world can be accomplished.” Therefore, if one wants to achieve something, one must "arouse valiant intention and make a firm resolution." In this process of practicing the Way, one must be “regardless of life and death." One must have the courage to not fear death, but to only fear that one's thoughts are wrong, that one's words and deeds are incorrect. One should be “regardless of success or failure”. If bad habits surface, it doesn’t matter, "Do not fear the arising of a thought, but fear the slowness of awareness." Quickly turn back to the right thought. Don’t think if you have a wrong thought, “Ah, I’m doing it again, I'm not good enough, I’m a failure." Don’t fall into a series of negative thoughts, one leading to another. If a thought is wrong, “snap,” “Sages and worthy men can be trained to become so," you just return to the right path. The difference between a sage and a madman is but a single thought. Therefore, one must be “regardless of life and death,” fearing only incorrect thoughts, and have this kind of great courage.

Furthermore, Confucius expected his students to not become “petty scholars” in *Book Six of the Analects, Yong Ye*, when he said to Zixia, “You must be a noble scholar, not a petty scholar.” A petty scholar is one who studies traditional culture to get a minor official position and live comfortably. That’s not the goal.  What must a true Confucian scholar do? Cultivate oneself, regulate one’s family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. One must have such aspirations.

Fourth, where is courage expressed? It is expressed in mutual learning. "Learn, and then know your deficiencies; teach, and then know your difficulties. Knowing your deficiencies, you can then reflect on yourself; knowing your difficulties, you can then strengthen yourself.”  Those of us who are engaged in education, if we dare to reflect on our own shortcomings and dare to admit our mistakes to students, this also requires courage. If we do not dare to admit our shortcomings and speak carelessly about what we don't understand, we are misleading our students. "To know when you know, and to know when you do not know, that is knowledge.” I remember when I was teaching at elementary school, I broke a promise once.  It was my habit to start explaining and making excuses.  I looked at the students' expressions, and it was clear: they couldn’t listen anymore, they were about to explode... I felt terrible inside and struggled with this. Finally, I mustered the courage, bowed deeply, and said, "I broke my promise, teacher was wrong," bowing to them. When I raised my head, the students' eyes were gleaming: teachers also apologize, and they also believe in “correcting their mistakes and becoming like new".  Following our habits makes us suffer and others can’t tolerate it.  However, summoning courage to apologize and taking responsibility is good for oneself. Not following habits also benefits others.

Once, Confucius happened to visit Wucheng, where his student Ziyou was the magistrate.  When Confucius arrived in Wucheng, he heard the sounds of *qin* and *se* (traditional Chinese instruments) playing music from the *Book of Songs*. It must have been very beautiful and captivating. Confucius was very happy and said jokingly, "Why use an ox-cleaver to cut up a chicken?" which is similar to the English idiom “using a sledgehammer to crack a nut”. Ziyou heard what Confucius said, and said to Confucius, "Master, I once heard your teachings that a noble leader who learns the Way, that is, learns the educational influence of rites and music, would then love the people and understand even more how to care for them. A common person who learns the Way would know how to obey the country’s orders and be very kind. This is what you taught me.  So now I use rites and music to teach the people, why do you say it is like using an ox-cleaver to cut up a chicken?” After Confucius heard this, he immediately said, "Oh, students, students, Ziyou is right! I was just joking. I was wrong.” He immediately apologized to his student. But in fact, to be honest, Confucius was very pleased and comforted to see that his student was truly practicing the educational influence of rites and music. This is the fourth point of courage, mutual learning and teaching.

Let's look again, learning from Confucius also includes the fourth large aspect, Confucius's behavior and dignified bearing were excellent. As a teacher, every move and every word was proper. When students saw this, they naturally developed respect in their hearts. Today, if a school teacher stood on the stage wearing shorts and flip-flops, would the students in the audience be respectful? Thus, "respect yourself and then others will respect you." Clothing is a display of one's bearing. In the *Analects*, it is mentioned that Confucius was "gentle but firm, majestic but not fierce, respectful yet composed." He was gentle but not without dignity, that is “gentle but firm." "Majestic but not fierce." Although he had dignity, he did not give a sense of oppression. "Respectful yet composed." Ordinarily, being gentle might be seen as lacking in serious and commanding influence. And being too majestic might create pressure.  Confucius was majestic but not fierce. He was respectful, and very polite and respectful to others, but his mind and body were very gentle and peaceful. Actually, his respect came completely from his heart, a natural expression of his inherent nature. That's why his body and mind were naturally peaceful. In the beginning when we learn, if we want to respect others, we have to pretend a little. For example, today if I am greeting ten or more people, after I finish bowing to everyone, “Ah, let me lie down for an hour, my body feels a little stiff!”  The goal is for all of this to be a natural expression of one’s true heart, so that one is in the middle way, "respectful yet composed," and “majestic but not fierce.”

Also, a disciple said, "A noble person has three changes." They thought Confucius had three changes. "From afar, he looks majestic.”  From far away, one could see Confucius's great dignity.  "When you get close, he is warm.” When you got close to him, you felt very warm and approachable.  “When you listen to his words, they are sharp.”  When Confucius spoke, he would touch their souls, every word was filled with righteousness. So, it's said “a noble person has three changes.”  Actually, the noble person didn't change. The unchanging is the sincere care and love that was expressed in his dignified presence. That's why it is said "what is sincere within is manifested outwardly." Therefore, Confucius's behavior is also worth learning from and imitating his virtue in our hearts.

That's all for our sharing today. Next time, we will discuss the seventh point, “the importance of self-education”.  Thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Lecture 13: The Importance of Self-Education: 1. Educators Must First Educate Themselves**

Respected guests, elders, and fellow students, good afternoon!

Over the past few lectures, we've been discussing the dignity of the teaching profession with the theme of "being a guiding light for a child's entire life."  When we talk about dignity, self-respect precedes the respect of others.  Our own actions must be worthy of respect.  Respect and dignity are never demanded; all of life's results are earned through our own cultivation, and will naturally materialize when the time is right.

Today, we are concluding our discussion on "being a guiding light for a child's entire life" by focusing on the last key point. Whenever we talk about "teachers," I am reminded of an incident when a company in Haikou invited me to deliver a management course.  They were very interested in the wisdom of the ancient sage-kings who governed their countries so well, and their management methods. High-level executives attended the course. I asked them, "As we begin this management course today, who is the first person you think about managing?" They replied, “Of course, it's managing our employees.”

I also recall that in July 2004, we held the first "Happy Life Lecture" in Haikou.  Coincidentally, during the course we were in a hotel.  A woman suddenly came into the classroom during a break.  She was about thirty years old, and her child seemed to be in elementary school. She saw a copy of *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student) on the table.  Looking at it, she said, “*Di Zi Gui*…ah, something for children to learn.” And then she left. The term “*di zi* (弟子)” doesn't only refer to children.  Aren't we all disciples of our parents? Aren't we all disciples of our teachers when we are at school? Aren’t we all disciples of our leaders or mentors in various professions? If you don’t have the attitude of a disciple, how can you learn from the wisdom and life experience of your parents, teachers, and leaders, and develop your abilities? She felt that “*di zi*” only referred to children. Therefore, when many parents get a copy of *Di Zi Gui*, who do they first teach? The mothers become like police officers, and they teach the children! So, attitude determines success or failure. Attitude determines success, instead of changing your attitude after achieving success.

Therefore, if a teacher is to become one who can transform souls, their mindset is crucial when they take on this role. What is that mindset?  Self-education is the most important. The *Shang Shu* (Book of Documents) tells us, "The enlightened first enlighten others." If you haven't enlightened yourself, how can you possibly help others to become enlightened? You can only love others after loving yourself; only help others after helping yourself; and only know others after knowing yourself. If we don't understand our own problems, how can we solve the problems of others?

Today's key point, the seventh, emphasizes the importance of self-education, which is very critical. When should we practice self-education? Anytime, anywhere. For instance, how many times have I practiced self-education today? People who truly practice self-education understand that "learning is like rowing upstream; you must advance or you will be pushed back." Have I made more progress today than yesterday? Otherwise, I will be regressing. Have I made more progress this hour than the previous one? Furthermore, how do we measure progress and regression? It occurs with each thought. "The difference between a sage and a madman lies in a single thought." There’s also the saying, "A single misstep can lead to eternal regret."  Where does this misstep occur?  It begins with a single errant thought, which then leads to the wrong action. So, how do we practice self-education? By carefully observing our own mind. The difference between sagehood and madness lies in a single thought, so we must always be mindful whether our thoughts are enlightened or deluded. If we can't even observe our own thoughts, it's very difficult to truly help others.

As the *San Zi Jing* (Three Character Classic) tells us, “At birth, people are inherently good.” We believe that we possess inherent goodness, and that all people possess inherent goodness. Then, shouldn’t this attitude be something "we must never depart from for even an instant?" Is it possible to believe this truth now, and then five minutes later, not believe it anymore? Yes, it’s possible. Five minutes later, we might see the person we dislike most, and then no longer believe in this truth. If we can always maintain “inherent goodness” and “manifesting luminous virtue" when we see people all day, believing that they can all become sages and worthies, our thoughts are grounded in right mindfulness. If we judge some as superior, others as inferior, or feel displeasure with another, we are indulging in delusional thoughts and are in a state of delusion. So self-education means constantly monitoring our own thoughts anytime and anywhere. The principles are simple, but applying them to every single detail of our lives is not easy. For example, just before coming on stage, I had to observe my own feelings of nervousness. When I was about to go on stage, would I be nervous? Why would I be nervous? Because I had excessive attachment to gain and loss. That means I was also confused and deluded. So, I had to adjust my thoughts immediately.

An educator must be "diligent in teaching and courageous in correcting mistakes." Why be diligent in teaching? Because we have chosen this path.  If we choose to dedicate ourselves to education, then we should deeply love the work of education.  If you choose a career, don’t forget your original intention. If you choose a life partner, don’t forget your original intention. Whatever causes and conditions you choose, don’t forget your original intention. This shows a sincere heart.  Otherwise, we are just being insincere, and deceiving both ourselves and others. What is the meaning of such a life?  We must love deeply and have the attitude that every thought is geared towards helping each student become accomplished. Otherwise, our involvement in education can lead to wrongdoing.  If we don't love our students, we might hurt them through our words and actions. If we hurt them, they will lose trust in teachers; if they lose trust in teachers, they will not be willing to learn. If they don’t learn, they will lack wisdom and the well-being of their future generations will be jeopardized.  So, the teaching profession should only be taken up by those who have the true aspiration; if you don’t, then don’t choose it. No one is forcing you. This is a "noble undertaking," a profession to be worthy of our nation, our country, and the parents and ancestors of our students.

Diligent in teaching—where should this diligence lie? It shouldn't be in being fond of lecturing others, but rather in constantly improving ourselves. The sooner we improve, the sooner our students will benefit. A teacher who truly loves students will not need to be pushed or encouraged to study the teachings of sages and worthies. They will be self-motivated; this is the driving force behind their genuine desire to benefit students. Furthermore, within this diligence, we must understand the meaning of the word "teach (教)." As we discussed in previous lectures, the character has two X’s to the left and a child below. It means to set an example through our actions; the two X’s mean that those above influence those below, so we must constantly improve our own virtue, so that we can set a good example.

Education is mutual teaching and learning. Learning reveals what we lack, while teaching reveals our difficulties.  In the process of teaching, while elaborating on a theory, you might suddenly feel as if you haven't thoroughly understood it and cannot continue to explain. This makes you realize your own inadequacies.  Or, you might react emotionally to a student, which shows that your patience and anger are still major issues. You must recognize your own deficiencies.  Therefore, being diligent in teaching means that we must also courageously improve ourselves and correct our mistakes.  Are we being negligent or not diligent? Are we constantly working to courageously correct our mistakes? This mindset is incredibly important for a teacher. Being courageous in correcting our mistakes is the concrete manifestation of self-education.

To correct our mistakes, there is a prerequisite: we must know our mistakes before we know what to correct. Many people feel that they haven't done anything wrong. When discussing this amongst friends, a friend once said, “I don’t think I made any mistakes yesterday.” When someone claims that they made no mistakes, it means two things: either they are a sage, or they are completely unaware of their mistakes.  How many thoughts do people have in a day? How many words do we speak?  How many actions do we take? How many times do we blink? When we look at others, do our eyes inspire them or discourage them? Some people are told by their friends, “You speak very harshly.” And they respond, “Really? Really?” They are completely unaware of when they were wrong.  So, to know our own faults, we must first overcome a barrier, which is that we "are controlled by our bad habits and completely unaware of them."

For example, I wonder if any educators have ever heard their students say to each other, "That teacher is so fierce! Such a bad temper!" And we happen to overhear them. As a teacher, if we go over to them and ask, "Do I have a bad temper? Do I have a bad temper?" Our temper is already flaring up at that moment! When we are being criticized and feel anger rising, then what they say is likely accurate. So there may be some habits that we haven't noticed for decades. What should we do then? We must delve into the classics and compare ourselves to the teachings, only then can we recognize our mistakes, and then take the next step of correcting them. We need to read the classics, listen to courses on traditional culture, and compare ourselves to those teachings.

Furthermore, we should more humbly put into practice what *Di Zi Gui* says: "Feel apprehension when praised, and joy when criticized." If we don't know our own problems, and we continue to make mistakes, and still negatively affect our students, then we have failed our responsibilities as a teacher. We should correct our mistakes as soon as possible, in order to be worthy of our students. Therefore, we should be happy when people point out our problems. If we are not happy when people point out our problems, it is because we are clinging to our ego and bad habits. We should be happy when people point out our problems, because every thought is for the benefit of our students, every thought is for our own benefit, and that is why we should be happy. Because by knowing our mistakes and correcting them, we are improving ourselves. That is true self-love. Only those who don’t love themselves care so much about their image and refuse to let go of bad habits.

Frankly speaking, how many people truly understand love? Love must begin with self-love. Speaking about this, I am very grateful to my father. Although he never hit me, I was indeed quite mischievous. Sometimes my behavior was too much for my father to tolerate, and he would bring out the family cane. I would suddenly remember the saying, "A wise man understands the times and adjusts his actions accordingly." Seeing that the cane was so thick, I would quickly admit my mistakes. Sometimes people are punished by their parents or elders because they refuse to admit their mistakes.  So, elders need to punish our memory to adjust our stubbornness and rebelliousness. When my father brought out the cane, I would say, “Dad, I was wrong,” and then I wouldn’t get beaten, right?  Of course, my father would use that opportunity to clearly explain my mistakes, to prevent me from repeating them.  In the process of educating me, the words he repeated most often were, "Son, you must love yourself."  Ah, those words were repeated so many times and are deeply etched in my memory. When I heard teachers and elders say, "The education of the ancient sages and worthies was the education of love," the idea of "self-love" came to mind. We should not waste our lives. Wasting our lives hurts all those who care about us, because they worry and are concerned for us. How can we return the love of those who care about us by doing that? Then we are ungrateful and have little conscience.

My father often exhorted me to love myself. When I was older, I talked to my mother. She said, "Whenever your father disciplined you, did you really understand the principles he was teaching you?" My mother never said a word while my father was educating me, as she was supporting him in educating me. But she was listening on the side, wondering if I, an elementary school student, really understood.  Later, I told my mother that I understood everything he said. When my father disciplined me, I never had the feeling, “Dad, I don't understand what you're saying.” Never. Why? Because my father was speaking to us from his sincere heart, and a sincere heart will resonate with another sincere heart. Truly, when I recall the way my father educated us, that expression of disappointment is still vivid in my mind. We deeply understood the concern he had for us. So my siblings and I often encouraged each other by saying, "Our parents have been so good to us. At the very least, we can’t cause them so much worry."

To overcome being controlled by our bad habits and being unaware of them, we must first understand the principles.  Only when we understand the principles can we observe ourselves and hold ourselves to higher standards. The first key point in the classics is, "Educators must first be educated themselves," because the classics emphasize, “The noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Way will flourish." When discussing the importance of self-education, the first fundamental principle is "educators must first be educated themselves." As we discussed earlier regarding mindset, when parents have children, if they don’t first think about educating themselves, but only think about educating their children, they will not be successful in educating their children. For example, parents often lose their tempers with their children and say, "How many times have I told you? You never listen!" When parents are emotional, they are no longer setting a good example for their children. "How many times have I told you?" shows that they lack understanding about how teaching through example, is the most critical part of education. In fact, from their words, it reveals that their understanding of education is already inadequate. They should first be educated themselves.

So before we teach at a school, we should have the mindset that we learned from our teachers: When you’re emotional, don’t teach children.  When we’re emotional, we cannot control our bad habits, so how can we teach them? Moreover, the deepest impression a child will have is their parents’ bad temper. Frankly speaking, they can't remember many of the principles that you told them. Therefore, when parents have bad tempers, it doesn't matter what they tell their children. Later, when the children look back, they will not remember much, because they were engulfed by that emotional state. So, if you have a bad temper, don’t teach children right away. Instead, take a break to calm your emotions first, before teaching. Parents should do this; so should teachers and leaders.

Once this mindset is established, we will have grasped the principle that “the noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Way will flourish." The principles of "ruler, parent, and teacher" are all interconnected. To recap what was said in the *Analects*, "When a person is upright, even without giving orders, they will be followed; if a person is not upright, even if they give orders, they will not be followed.” When a "ruler, parent, or teacher" is upright, you won’t have to demand compliance; your virtuous conduct will influence your children. "When a person is upright, even without giving orders, they will be followed; if a person is not upright, even if they give orders, they will not be followed.” If we don’t set a good example, even if we give repeated orders, children, students, and subordinates might not comply. In fact, this might create a negative trend, where people appear to comply but actually do not; they will act one way in front of their parents or leaders, and another way when they are not present. When we observe that a child is being superficially obedient, we should not get angry at him, but instead, we should reflect on whether we ourselves have set a good example, because teaching by example is the foundation of education. "The noble person focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Way will flourish."

For example, in education, I once heard a principal (a high school principal) lament, "Some education has become short-sighted, neglecting the root and pursuing the superficial." This means not focusing on the root, but pursuing the superficial. What is the root?  Virtue is the root. What is superficial? Knowledge, skills, and talent are superficial. One must have both virtue and talent; and one must use one's talents for virtuous purposes, and one’s knowledge for virtuous purposes. Someone might use their scientific knowledge to create weapons to kill people.  Are they not intelligent? Do they not have talent? But they lack the foundation of virtue. The *Zizhi Tongjian* (Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance) tells us, “Virtue is the commander of talent.” Virtue is the commander, it governs our abilities. Today, if we lack virtue, then even if we have high academic credentials, our words might hurt our spouses; our actions might cause our leaders to be heartbroken. We often see that people who are put in leadership roles today, are trained by one leader for many years. In the end, however, they end up taking half the team with them in pursuit of their own gain. They are where they are today, only because of the five or eight years of training from their previous leader.  Yet, they are so callous. They can take half of the organization with them.  Aren't their words and abilities great? Yes, they are.  But they are without virtue; they don't understand the meaning of loyalty.

Short-sightedness makes us teach children to only care about the present and their immediate benefit. They do not focus on the root. Without the root, when faced with temptations, everything will crumble. Without virtue, it is difficult for men to resist the temptations of sensual pleasures. So all of us in education, today, as we dedicate ourselves to the work of education, we need to ask ourselves, "Are we sure that our students will not be enticed by sensual pleasures?" If you are, please raise your hand. "Are you sure your students will not get divorced?" If you are, please raise your hand. If we are in the field of education, and we don't even have the confidence to teach our children to avoid divorce, then can we really give them happiness? Do we have the confidence that our students will not get cancer, will not suffer from modern illnesses, will not have depression or bipolar disorder, will not commit suicide, will not have abortions? If any of these happen to them, they will not have a happy life. Will they never disobey their parents? Will brothers not fight each other? Will they not fight over property? Will they not abandon their parents? Will they support their parents? Will they not break the laws of their country? With virtue, none of these will happen. So, we must focus on the root. Otherwise, frankly speaking, there will be many difficult paths ahead in our children's lives.

The principal also said that we cannot be short-sighted. Education is a project that takes a hundred years, and we cannot be impatient, or else it becomes about pursuing personal gain. This principal gave an analogy that left a deep impression on me. He said, "If you put an egg in salty water, what will it become after a week?" A salted egg. "If you put an egg in sweet water, in brown sugar water, what will it become after a week?” A sweet egg. This will happen naturally, so what’s the rush? This reminds us, whatever we do, not to rush.

In fact, self-cultivation is the foundation of everything, and how do we begin cultivating ourselves? "The most important task in learning is to subdue and calm the restlessness within." When we are restless, we are close to getting angry, and close to getting impatient.  When we get angry, it is like setting fire to our virtues and opening the gate to hundreds of obstacles. If we are falling, how can we possibly benefit others? We harm ourselves and others. Restlessness is a precursor to losing one’s temper. So, we must be patient, and calm the desire to be quick and the greedy seeking mind. "A rope can cut through wood; water dripping can pierce through stone; when the time is right, the water will carve its path, and a fruit will ripen."  If you have this mindset, I guarantee that you will live to eighty or a hundred years old. If you are rushing all the time: "Hurry, hurry, hurry to eat; hurry, hurry, hurry to do things; hurry, hurry, hurry in the car; hurry, hurry, hurry to die," this is not a curse, but the more impatient people are, the faster their hearts beat.  Each person is given a set number of heartbeats in their life. If you are always rushing and your heart goes, "thump, thump, thump," someone who should have lived to ninety, might die at sixty, because their heart has beat too quickly. Someone who should have only lived to sixty might live longer, because they are calm and composed, and cultivate themselves. Everyone else is agitated, like ants on a hot pan, but they say, "Let's have a cup of Yibao white coffee, or some Fujian Tieguanyin." Those who accomplish great things are not irritable, and not chaotic. They are able to be calm and composed. Therefore, "the most important task in learning is to subdue and calm the restlessness within." This is truly the advice of someone who has been there, someone who has truly walked the path of cultivation.

When we talk about focusing on the root, as we said before, we can’t neglect the root and pursue the superficial. The best examples of “focusing on the root” are the eight virtues outlined at the beginning of *The Great Learning*: "Those who desire to manifest their luminous virtue to all under heaven..." This is the ultimate goal and aspiration of life. So those who truly understand the ancient books, will harbor a concern for the safety and well-being of the world. If they don’t have this concern, then thirty years spent reading ancient books is in vain, because the teachings have not entered their heart; they treat it like intellectual knowledge, and even have ulterior motives. "Ah, if I study hard, get a master's degree and doctorate, then I can make a good salary later." That is not true learning; that is just knowledge, a tool for academic study, so that they can earn an income. Those who have truly learned will always think about the world, and always work to the best of their abilities and hold their thoughts in check. Because “inner sage, outer king” means that "inner" must align with the intentions of the sages, and "outer king", the "king" is first and foremost a model; a model for the family, the group, and the nation. In this “inner sage,” "reverence and sincerity” are incredibly important, in order to keep our hearts of sincerity and reverence.

When we speak of focusing on the root, and that "when the root is established, the Way will flourish," we are reminded of the eight virtues, and that “Those who desire to manifest their luminous virtue to all under heaven” is the highest goal. "Those who desire to manifest their luminous virtue to all under heaven, must first govern their state," which means that governing a state is the root of pacifying the world; “Those who desire to govern their state, must first manage their families,” which means that managing the family is the root of governing a state. If we wish to benefit society, we must first manage our families, because "one who cannot teach his family, cannot teach others." This is the teaching of *The Great Learning.*

Okay, here's a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and a natural English flow, suitable for a general audience:

**The Importance of Cultivating the Self: Root and Branch**

We see people who have devoted decades to social charity and enjoy a great reputation in society. Then, suddenly, their child commits a crime and ends up in the police station. When this hits the news, public opinion erupts with discussions about why someone who does good deeds doesn't even take care of their own child. This creates a negative impact on society, and the person often hastily leaves the organization they belong to, fearing that people will no longer trust that group. So, the problems emerge. If you don’t address the root cause, problems will inevitably surface sooner or later. You can’t rely on luck.

“Those who desire to regulate their family, must first cultivate their person.” Cultivating the person is the root, while regulating the family is the branch. This "branch" isn't about size or importance, but rather that if your root is deep, your leaves will naturally be lush. The leaves are the branch, and the flowers and fruit are also branches. If the root is deep, it absorbs nutrients and water well, and naturally, the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit will be good. Therefore, if you cultivate your person well, then you will surely regulate your family well. "Those who desire to cultivate their person, must first rectify their heart." The heart is the root of cultivating the person. "Those who desire to rectify their heart, must first make their intentions sincere; those who desire to make their intentions sincere, must first extend their knowledge; extending knowledge lies in the investigation of things." We were just discussing how, when it comes to educating children, we're often impatient for quick results and resort to forcing growth, like pulling up seedlings. Does this have anything to do with the investigation of things? Yes, it does. Forcing growth is about being greedy for speed and wanting to see results quickly – that is simply greed. The investigation of things is about eliminating material desires.

"When things are investigated, then knowledge is extended." When worries and material desires lessen, wisdom grows. With growing wisdom, you are constantly self-educating and self-reflecting. Your heart will be genuine, and you will be sincere. You will be upright towards yourself and others. You will not deceive yourself, but rather improve yourself. You will do your best to help others. When the heart is right, all words and actions will follow proper conduct. This will naturally lead to the good outcomes of self-cultivation, family regulation, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world – which are emphasized in Confucianism. Daoism also teaches, “Correct yourself, then influence others.” Correcting oneself is the root, while influencing others is the natural outcome, the branch.

This emphasis on the root can be understood through a proverb: "To melt the selfishness in one’s character is a great achievement." This shows the effort required for self-cultivation. “To eliminate discord within the family is a great undertaking.” The focus is first on the selfishness in one's character. How do you see progress in self-cultivation? By how much your character has changed, how many bad habits you've let go of. Learning from sages and the classics should be about substance, not just form. It's not that someone who recites more classics has true learning, or someone who has listened to more lectures is more knowledgeable. Frankly speaking, someone who has memorized a lot of classics and heard a lot of lectures and still goes around showing off, is someone who can't see their own selfishness and is actually displaying it. Those who truly understand the classics, through reciting and listening, will be more aware of their own flawed thoughts and behaviors. Why? Because reciting and listening are about understanding principles. The more you understand, the more you realize your own shortcomings! Discovering your faults means you haven't wasted the day. You haven't deceived yourself; you've seen your problems, instead of being completely oblivious. Correcting one’s faults is true self-cultivation and true refinement. These two phrases are very important: without recognizing your faults, you haven't truly entered the teachings of the sages.  If you interpret the teachings, but don’t bring it into your life, it’s just knowledge, not true learning.

So, who is truly courageous and diligent? It's the person who tames their bad habits. We talked about not deceiving ourselves. Let's examine ourselves: After five or ten years of study, what serious bad habits have we actually let go of? We used to be very concerned about saving face, but now we aren't; we used to reject others' opinions, but now we can humbly accept them; we used to be suspicious, but now we can trust others; we used to be arrogant, but now we are humble. *That* is true learning!

We've seen people whose thoughts serve as our own lessons, and may counteract our most severe habits. For example, I remember that in 2007, Mr. Ye, the head of Jumeixin Company in Nanjing, attended classes in Lujiang and was deeply moved. Later, we met Mr. Ye's father, who was very upright and strongly supported traditional culture. Consequently, his son also strongly supported it – every effect has a cause. Mr. Ye was so supportive that he wanted to donate a piece of his company's land to build a traditional culture school, to promote traditional culture. This was a great thing, right? Over the years, many traditional culture learners on the mainland have been nourished by this land and its teachings. When Mr. Ye had this idea, which was a great one, his first thought was: "I need to ask my wife." That thought was so valuable. We often tend to be domineering when doing good deeds, thinking, "I’m doing a good thing, so of course, you should support me." That’s a bad habit. Mr. Ye had made this great decision, yet he still greatly respected his wife. She had been through the business struggles with him, and therefore, he did not display self-centeredness. Self-centeredness easily leads to self-willfulness and selfishness, doing things without consulting or respecting others. That thought of consulting his wife is where we can learn a lesson.

Sometimes we overestimate our own level. When we read the classics or attend lectures, we feel great: "I don't have any bad thoughts. Ah, so pure!" Be careful; even purity can lead to greed. You can become attached to a state of mind, then you start liking one thing and disliking another. Then what's the point of talking about purity? Purity should mean not being attached to favorable circumstances and not being angry with unfavorable circumstances. So, if we are not careful, selfishness and attachments quickly reappear. It's not easy to carefully protect one's mind or observe one's own heart. We may feel great listening to teachings, but the moment we encounter family or the crowds, those bad habits all return immediately. Therefore, we can't judge our progress by ourselves. We need to examine ourselves and test ourselves to know. When do we test ourselves? When we interact with others. When interacting with a group, it’s easy to discover our personal flaws.

For instance, the “Being Your Child's Lifelong Mentor” training we held in Nanjing was for principals and kindergarten directors. The principals are usually the heads of their schools. When they gathered here, they had to share rooms, since usually they have private rooms when traveling on business. At Jumeixin, in Nanjing, several principals shared rooms and had to queue for the bathroom. They hadn’t experienced this kind of thing for a long time, and it was uncomfortable for them. People who have had it too good should take a trip to Africa – it’ll quickly improve their character. Otherwise, they will keep indulging their desires. So, what is being tested here? Letting go of selfishness. In a group, you need to think of others and not expect others to accommodate you. You need to be considerate when using the restroom, so others have their turn. That consideration for others will gradually adjust your selfishness and self-interest. Being with a group is a great experience. “Why do I find this person unpleasant, that person annoying?” It's arrogance, again revealing selfishness.

Today, if our actions cause distress to those living with us, we should feel ashamed. We’ve deviated from the path of kindness and harmed them. Yet, when someone is upset or distressed, we’re likely to have another thought: “It's just a small thing. Why are you getting so upset?” Notice that we are not reflecting on ourselves but instead blaming the other person. Therefore, taming our selfish tendencies is important. If such a temper arises at home, and you’re arguing with your siblings, and you’re still complaining and grumbling, you are not aware that you’re breaking your parents’ heart. “Branches from the same tree thrive together.” Parents are the root. If the siblings are in conflict, it's like the branches being cut, how could the parents not be in pain? I once heard of two sisters who were upset with each other and didn’t speak for three years. How could people let their anger create such a disaster? If the sisters don’t speak for three years, how can their mother live? So, we have to change our tempers. If we constantly think of our parents, we can definitely change them! It's only when we're always thinking of ourselves that we can't change. When we think of others, it's easier to change.

Within selfishness, we see the word "self." It represents self-centeredness. Whatever *we* like, we love it excessively; whatever we dislike, we see nothing good about it. Thus, when the heart is biased, we can't see things clearly. Therefore, the *Great Learning* (大學), which we have been referencing, emphasizes the importance of the root. “To know the bad in what one likes, and to know the good in what one dislikes, such people are rare.” If we like someone, we should still be able to see their shortcomings; if we dislike someone, we should still be able to acknowledge their strengths and contributions. If one’s heart is biased, we criticize for the sake of criticism, creating a harmful polarization. Think of the arguments between political parties; don't they ever do anything good? Yet, all you hear is criticisms as if the other side is completely wrong. If political figures lead in such ways, and the public unknowingly learns that behavior, it will cause problems. It will lead to what? Being harsh and unkind.

Selfishness is a severe problem. We need to let go of our likes and dislikes – that is, our bias. As we’ve discussed, when should we engage in self-education? Anytime, anywhere. “The Way (道) cannot be separated from us for even a moment.” Why? Because, “At birth, our nature is good.” Since our nature is good, why would you dislike someone? If you feel their behavior is wrong, that's just their bad habit, not their inherent goodness. If someone has inherent goodness but is now being led astray by bad habits, you should pity them. Why would you be angry at them? It’s because you haven’t understood that everyone has this inherent goodness. Those who understand this truth will no longer be confused and have mistaken thoughts and feelings. So, do we truly believe that, “At birth, our nature is good”? Those who truly believe it will not dislike or distrust anyone, but rather think of how to help them to realize their best potential.

If you have a good relationship with someone, then help them improve. Don’t let your good relationships develop into mutual obsession and clinging, because that lacks wisdom. In Taiwan, I’ve seen couples so close and attached to one another that when the husband died unexpectedly, the wife couldn't live anymore. This was not real love, using wisdom to care for each other. The wife eventually committed suicide. This love was misguided. Love should be rational, not possessive. There should be love accompanied by wisdom. True love includes wisdom.

How should we love someone? Love should be such that, even in my absence, the person can become better. Our interactions with them should consistently improve them. Like a wise mother who cares for her child, accompanies their growth, and doesn't allow them to become dependent on her. Instead, she helps them to become independent and able to care for themselves. *That* is the way a wise mother loves her children. Why? Because life is impermanent. How can we be sure we can be there for our loved ones always? Therefore, wise people consider the long term, not just the immediate. Parents who lack wisdom spoil their children just to make them happy at the moment, but that's not true love. That’s simply selfish desire. "Desire makes the wise confused, and profit makes the wise lose their sense of right and wrong." They are unable to think long-term. They are often controlled by their emotions. When do we finally begin to reflect on things? When our children become disobedient and unmanageable; then we realize how serious the issue is.

We emphasized the need to tame our likes and dislikes. Actually, understanding principles means realizing that what we’re doing is harming ourselves and others. If you truly understand this, would you continue doing it? That's simply foolishness. It’s not beneficial to ourselves or others. Continuing to do it is not the behavior of one who understands. Ask yourselves, does losing your temper do you any good? Does it do anyone else any good? No. If we still keep doing it, we are harming ourselves and others. We are “to be pitied” and even more pitiable than those who lose their temper without learning about traditional culture. We are more pitiable. They do not know, so their sin is smaller. We, however, know, but we still deliberately commit the offense.

So, we still have to make a firm decision. Confucius said, “Begin with the most difficult,” meaning that to walk the great path of kindness, begin by addressing our most serious and challenging bad habits. We need to “operate” on ourselves. Otherwise, bad habits can be buried deep. When someone points them out, we create a chain of excuses, so people won't want to give us further feedback. Those of us in education, especially, must be careful because this selfishness has a huge destructive power! Why? Because we don't have just one or two students, but maybe 30 to 40 in a class. If we favor some and become fond of them, they become arrogant. Then those you like look down on those you dislike. And those you dislike lose confidence and even resent you. Such a selfish heart destroys all the students. It destroys yourself and your students. Therefore, we must let go of that kind of heart.

We often see in the news that some young people set fire to motorcycles on the street. This is just the result. Why is a person so angry? We need to find the cause in order to solve the problem. Getting angry at the child when reading the news will not solve the problem. If we put all these children in prison, it won't solve the problem either. Why? Because the cause hasn't been addressed. Even in prison, they might just become worse. Initially, they were petty thieves; ten years later, they may become… you know, it’s hard to imagine. Unless prisons implement a system like the Hainan Prison system, which focuses on improving a person's heart. As Director Zhang Fa said, if you want to change a person, you have to start with their thoughts. If their thoughts and intentions are wrong, putting them in prison won't necessarily solve the problem.

In fact, when I saw those young people setting fires to cars, I recognized they had an anti-social attitude. Those who lack love tend to be anti-social; those who have love want to contribute to society, they would never be anti-social. Why do they lack love? Because they haven't received love from the two most important people in their lives: their parents and teachers. That resentment slowly builds up. Children grow up hearing, "My father said… my mother said… my teacher said…" Parents and teachers are the people they respect the most, why would they become rebellious? However, we may fail to love them, even becoming angry at or taking our anger out on them and randomly hitting them. Over time, their character is negatively affected. If a child doesn't do well in school, you shame them and make them stand in the corner, once, twice, three times... who could take it? Their personality will naturally become distorted.

“At birth, our nature is good.” Every educator must firmly believe that “At birth, our nature is good” so we won’t treat children in that way. Why? Because people develop at different rates, and you are using grades and scores to evaluate them. Then you give up on those who aren’t doing well. Education is about helping people reach their full potential, not about giving up on them. Like me, I blossomed later in life, though I’m still not fully there yet! I always had bad grades. My older sisters did much better than I did, but my parents never looked down on me. Every time I did badly on a test, my parents would say, “Keep going! Keep going!” Their eyes showed trust in me. With that trust, what feeling began to grow? Shame. My parents trusted me so much, how could I keep being disappointing? This shame spurred me on.

Also, in elementary school, some of my teachers trusted me so much. It just so happened that I had two teachers who had also taught my older sisters. My sisters were always number one in the whole school, while I was in the 20s in my class. There was quite a big difference! My homeroom teacher and science teacher, who had taught my older sisters, didn’t deny me, even though my grades weren’t good. I remember when those teachers came to my high school, and I hosted them, I was so happy. And then my science teacher, who was now a retired principal, Principal Ye, said, “Lixu and his sister, we’ve taught both of them. Lixu is like a “big chicken that crows late.”” A big chicken crows later. Why? Because they take a bigger breath, and their time to develop is longer. Everyone is different. In my local dialect, “big chicken crows late” means “a great talent that blossoms later in life.”

Hearing that really encouraged me. It’s unavoidable to make comparisons, put yourself in my shoes. My sister was always number one in the school; did I feel pressure? You really understand how that must have felt. In middle school, during every award ceremony, they would call, “First place, Cai Rongqing,” and my sister would go on stage. I would quickly lower my head. My classmates would say, “Your sister! Your sister!” "Uh…." It's important to be empathetic. If you’re smart, have good grades, and are highly educated, you have to be gentle when interacting with your siblings. Otherwise, your words can unknowingly hurt them. You need to be considerate of them.

So, as we were saying, if we truly believe that, “At birth, our nature is good,” we would have trust in all our children. We wouldn’t exclude them or have biases. I once shared a true story: a high-ranking postal manager in charge of a branch office had a son who did very well in school, and a daughter who didn’t. The son was the older brother and earned a PhD; the daughter only graduated from vocational school. The father favored his son greatly, while he looked down upon his daughter due to her poor grades, revealing a strong bias based on performance. As a result, his son came back from university in America and told his father, "Dad, I don't know when you're going to die, but you have so much property and money, so please transfer it to me immediately." His father was stunned. After spending 20 years developing his son, he came back only to demand his assets.

The current trend in the world is utilitarianism, whereas traditional culture is about righteousness! Unless your child has a good foundation in virtue, sending them overseas to study is – and I'll say this plainly – a very risky endeavor. Unless they have a good foundation in virtue, have older mentors who can watch over them while abroad, or are truly a sage reborn. Otherwise, how could they be sure not to be corrupted? They will still have to have a process of growing and self-cultivation. Their determination and virtue, the so-called “unwavering by wealth and power, unmoved by poverty and hardship, and unbowed by might and threats,” should enable them to avoid corruption. Many university students, I’d dare say more than half, will spend money much more freely overseas.

After the father heard this from his son, he was so deeply shaken he ended up in a mental hospital. At this moment, who showed up? You guessed it, the daughter. She told her father that she didn't want a penny of his money, and that she would give him 5,000 Taiwan dollars a month for living expenses. That’s how she saved her father.

Later, the son got married and had a child. The child had health issues, and before even turning one, had been hospitalized many times and undergone several surgeries. Since he was so disobedient towards his father, how could his children not have issues? "A family that accumulates goodness will have blessings that extend to its descendants. A family that accumulates badness will have misfortune that extends to its descendants." In fact, when you reflect deeply, nothing in this world is truly a bad thing. The son received the consequences of his actions, so he could finally wake up. When he was in the hospital, perhaps he would think of when he was a child, and he got sick. He would remember his parents' worried faces. That shame would awaken his sense of wrongdoing. His child’s experiences served as a catalyst for his awakening. Otherwise, it would have been hard for him to wake up. "Only when one raises a child does one know the debt of gratitude to one's own parents."

This all relates to the topic of self-cultivation.


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided text, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural flow in English:

**Title:** Transforming Family Discord: The True Test of Cultivation

"The ability to resolve discord within the family is a matter of great importance and a testament to one's true cultivation." Where does a person’s virtue and self-cultivation manifest? It's in the ability to use sincerity to resolve conflicts within the family. If, after studying traditional culture for five or ten years, family conflicts remain unresolved or even worsen, it signifies a lack of genuine cultivation. True cultivation should naturally influence others. How can one fail to influence their closest family members? Many people are enthusiastic in public, but return home unable to communicate with their families. Their enthusiasm is therefore not genuine, but rather mixed with vanity. They act, and people praise and flatter them, providing a sense of accomplishment. But at home, without recognition or applause, they feel it's meaningless. This is something we must observe in ourselves.

Chairman Hao Tielong of Xinjiang, once gave a lecture at our center. One point he made left a lasting impression. While studying traditional culture, he suddenly had a thought: "I kept meticulous records of the money I lent my younger brother, yet I frequently donate considerable sums to charities. How can I be so generous to strangers but so calculating with my own sibling?" He reflected on how his good intentions were impure, tainted by the desire for recognition. He realized that understanding leads to change; without understanding, even five or ten years of study may not be effective. Upon returning home, he told his brother, "You don't need to repay the money. I'll help you find a good house and get your family settled.” He said his brother immediately burst into tears. Who was most overjoyed? Their mother.  The following year, he brought his entire family back to their ancestral home in Henan to pay respects, and the whole family was harmonious and happy. Who would be most pleased by this act of ancestor worship? The spirits of their ancestors in heaven. This is an example of resolving conflict within the family.

Frankly speaking, every family has its own unique set of difficulties; this is not easily done. It's neither simple nor impossible; the key lies in sincerity and a righteous heart. With the correct mindset, anything is achievable. In the Ming Dynasty, there was a scholar named Wu Zitien, whose wife's surname was Sun. Wu Zitien's mother had passed away early, and his father had remarried. His stepmother was biased, favoring his younger brother over him. Gradually, resentment grew in his heart. Later, after he married, his stepmother also mistreated his wife. He felt wronged and wanted to confront his stepmother, but his wife always persuaded him to refrain. Eventually, his father passed away, leaving land and silver as inheritance. However, his stepmother allocated the worst land to him, while she and his younger brother kept the best land, and she also embezzled a significant sum of money. At that point, Wu Zitien could no longer bear it and was about to confront his stepmother. Again, his wife stopped him, preventing a family dispute over property.

When studying traditional culture, the first thing to learn is to be willing to take a loss, especially with family. Do not be calculating with your closest relatives; if you do, you will not truly learn. Furthermore, understand that what is rightfully yours will not be lost, and that you cannot acquire something through fighting for it. In fact, the more you fight, the more your blessings are diminished. Has anyone ever seen a family become more prosperous after going to court over inheritance? There's no such example. As the *Zhu Zi Family Precepts* states, “When proper human relationships are violated, decay quickly follows.” This wife was wise and extraordinary.  “A virtuous wife reduces her husband’s misfortunes." A virtuous wife can help her husband avoid many calamities.

As for the stepmother, her actions were unjust.  Soon after, her own son became addicted to gambling, squandered all their wealth, and she and her son nearly became beggars. If you were Wu Zitien, how would you react?  "Ah, heaven has eyes! You’ve finally gotten what you deserve!" Doesn't it sound rather strange? To speak such words to one's brother and stepmother is not in line with proper relationships.  At that moment, Sun knew what to do.  Before her husband could react, she immediately urged him to bring his mother and brother back home.  Is this something you can do? Abandon all past grievances. How else can you resolve family discord? Never dwell on another's transgressions. The moment you hold onto them, you might take advantage of the situation, and reconciliation will be impossible. They brought them back to share the New Year's feast, and she helped her brother break his gambling habit. Eventually, she moved their stepmother and younger brother, and the family became harmonious.

She bore three sons, and all three passed the imperial examinations, becoming *jinshi*. If something is truly part of your family's blessing, how can it be lost? It's already extraordinary for a family to have one *jinshi*, but she had three. Observe her blessings! Therefore, a great heart leads to great blessings. How can one be calculating with their closest family members? When her three sons were growing up, they witnessed their mother’s virtue and tolerance; how could they not become virtuous themselves? People must avoid being calculating and learn to accept losses; if you owe others, heaven will repay you. If we work in education, and if teachers and colleagues, or teachers and their parents or siblings are constantly at odds, and if we take our anger to the classroom, or even speak ill of our relatives and friends, won't we lead our students astray in life? Therefore, this story should be told to our students.

That concludes my discussion for this lesson. Thank you all.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a balance of accuracy, fluency, and maintaining the tone of the original speaker:

**Lecture 14: The Importance of Self-Education: 1. Educators Must First Educate Themselves; 2. Be Courageous in Correcting Faults; 3. Be Strict with Oneself and Lenient with Others**

Respected elders and fellow students, greetings everyone!

We just discussed that educators must first educate themselves. As the second point, we cited this teaching from *Cai Gen Tan* (菜根譚): “To harmonize one’s biases and personal inclinations is a great learning; to resolve internal family conflicts is a great undertaking.” The worst family relationships were no worse than those of King Shun; his father and stepmother wanted to harm him. Yet, within these circumstances, King Shun was able, with his utmost sincerity and filial piety, to move Emperor Yao, the ruler of the time, to move the entire nation, and ultimately, to move his father, his stepmother, and his arrogant younger brother. From this history, we can understand that, “Where there is sincere devotion, even metal and stone will yield.” “Metal and stone yielding” is the result; what is the cause? “Sincere devotion”. A person’s sincere heart must be present.

Mr. Zeng Guofan said, “A single thought not arising is called sincerity.” What is true sincerity?  It is only when there are no evil thoughts that one can be sincere, without greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, or doubt within. For example, today you become greedy, desiring another's possessions, can your words to them be sincere?  If you are emotional, you lack sincerity; if you are arrogant, you lack sincerity; with doubt or prejudice, sincerity is impossible. Therefore, you must give without any desire for return in order to be sincere; in your heart, there must be not a trace of prejudice against your family members for sincerity to be there.  With prejudice in your heart, the moment a situation arises, you seize upon it as an excuse, and an unreasonable fire erupts.

So, from the history of King Shun uniting his entire family, what life wisdom can we learn? “Admire the virtuous, admire their hearts.” We should admire and be able to perceive with what mindset the virtuous and sages faced their parents and loved ones. King Shun only had his parents in his heart; every thought was for his parents and he firmly believed that “At the beginning of humanity, the nature is good.”  Because of this belief, if he could not move others, he would reflect on whether he had done enough himself. Thus, “There is no one in the world who cannot be transformed, only fear that the sincerity is not profound enough.” King Shun had this mindset that no one in the world is beyond being transformed. When interacting with others, “see the nature, don’t cling to appearances.” See others' fundamental nature, believe that they possess inherent goodness and luminous virtue; do not be attached to their wrong actions. Only in this way can you be sincere. Once you become attached, “He once said something that made me so angry, what he did was so hurtful.” If you keep such things in mind, you cannot be sincere.

Therefore, at the beginning of today’s talk, we said that educators must first firmly believe that, “At the beginning of humanity, the nature is good.”  At this point, you will not only be attached to the other person's wrong actions, but you will view their wrong actions with lament and pity.  Because they have inherent goodness, they have become slaves to their desires and habits. It is as if a person was a multi-millionaire, but he does not know there are millions in his basement, and he goes begging for food. How would you act if you saw such a beggar? Is my analogy not specific enough? Would you tell him to continue begging? Imagine, a person has millions in his basement, yet he does not know and goes around begging with a broken bowl; what would you do if you saw that? “Great, I will dig out his millions first.” That is too greedy; the million dollars are analogous to the inherent goodness that each of us has; you do not need to dig out others’; you already have it yourself. Is that not the truth? Once you understand this principle, how can you bear to see them continue in such misery? Therefore, King Shun truly had the mindset of believing that everyone possesses inherent goodness at all times; he was respectful to everyone, and did his utmost to help them succeed.

Now, if we reflect on ourselves, why can't we do this? We don't believe.  And we have a serious problem that violates the *Di Zi Gui* (弟子規): remembering resentments and forgetting kindness. Our hearts are filled with rubbish; we keep all the bad things others have done to us, which is not self-love and pollutes the inherent goodness in our hearts; remembering resentments and forgetting kindness.  The *Di Zi Gui* tells us to repay kindness, but resentments should be forgotten. We cannot live our lives violating our inherent goodness; if we do, it is a reversal, and life will be very painful, bringing suffering to ourselves and to others. A person who remembers resentments and forgets kindness suffers, and their parents and loved ones suffer as well.

If we have sincerity, especially if we cultivate sincerity, the whole family will have confidence in traditional culture and the teachings of the sages.  If family members do not agree with our learning of traditional culture, it means we have not done well enough, and we cannot blame them. If we truly follow these teachings, why wouldn’t they accept it or be moved?  Therefore, “only fear that the sincerity is not profound enough,”  it must mean our mindset has not yet reached that point. This is how we must contemplate it.

Furthermore, do we truly value our parents and siblings more than our own lives?  We must be constantly thinking of them and be even willing to give our lives for them. When we have no selfish desires, that kind of sincerity will resonate.  It will not only resonate with family members, but it will also resonate with more help and support for our families.  For example, if we are in Malaysia now and our family members are in China, and we cultivate that sincere mindset, there may be benefactors appearing in our family or good opportunities to help them; this all depends on the sincerity to resonate.

For example, an elder of mine, Uncle Lu, in his organization, had many elders. These elders needed meridian adjustments because of their strenuous efforts for the cause of the Way and overwork.  He then sought out a very good doctor, requesting that doctor to treat these elders. The doctor hesitated because of the long travel distance and did not agree right away. Immediately, Uncle Lu “plop” knelt down and kowtowed to the doctor, “These elders have given so much for the public. They are very important. Please help them treat their bodies.”  On the spot, the doctor was deeply moved and immediately agreed to help.  Thus, sincerity can truly resonate.

And, in order to help our loved ones, it is said that, "Those near cinnabar get stained red; those near ink get stained black." We should use sincerity to resonate so that our loved ones can all have a good learning environment, so that they can gradually improve and grow. Therefore, to truly help a person, you must be very mindful and spend a lot of effort.  And it is only in the process of putting in that effort that we can truly know whether we are sincere and loving.  True love is patient.  How could we help someone, and then, when family members are not compliant or obedient, become immediately angry and upset? That is not a sincere heart, not genuine love.  We must see things through to the end. To protect someone’s growth and learning is not easy. Therefore, we see how long did it take King Shun to reverse all the conflicts and disharmony in his family?  It took a very long time.

The above are my thoughts shared in regards to the quote from the *Cai Gen Tan*. After understanding this quote, the real way to deal with family matters is, when faced with any situation, always turn back and reflect on ourselves.  That will definitely bring about change and lead to improvement.

Third, we must not deceive ourselves in our thoughts and intentions. Because the classics of the sages all teach us to cultivate ourselves from the root.  What is the root?  Our thoughts and intentions are the root.  In history, there is a story. Scholars in ancient times had a deep understanding of Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist classics. How do we know this? We can see this in the imperial edict of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty which proclaimed to the nation at large, “The three teachings enlighten the people of the land.”  “Three teachings” refers to Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism; they were the mainstream of Chinese culture. "Enlighten the people" refers to educating the people to eliminate evil and cultivate goodness, awakening their understanding, and because “the principles all come from one source, and the paths are not contradictory”, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism support each other. All these teachings educate us to transform from evil to good, and from delusion to enlightenment.

Mr. Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty, a great Confucian scholar, had a very good relationship with Buddhist Master Foyin.  There is an ancient saying: “One does not enter a temple unless they have a need”.  Monks in the mountains are pure and detached, their afflictions light, and their wisdom high. This is true of Bai Juyi, a scholar of the Tang Dynasty, a great Confucian scholar. He went to the mountains to visit Zen Master Niao Ke. Zen Master Niao Ke lived in a tree. Bai Juyi said, "Master, you are in great danger there!” The Zen Master pointed out to him, "You are in more danger than I am!"  Because he was an official, if he did not do a good job or made a wrong decision, it would harm the people, and his karma would be grave. Therefore, in official circles, he needed to be careful and not be negligent.  Later, Bai Juyi asked Zen Master Niao Ke what Buddhism was, and Zen Master Niao Ke said, "Do no evil, do all good." Bai Juyi laughed, "Even a three-year-old knows that." The Zen Master replied, "An eighty-year-old man can’t do it."

It seems that everyone understands the principle, but knowing without putting it into practice is just knowledge; it is not true cultivation or real learning. Does knowledge have side effects? Yes, they are called "Not acting vigorously, only studying literature," knowledge, ah "Grows the superficial, what kind of person does it create?" Therefore, now, the more education people have, the more arrogant they might be, because they are learning knowledge. If the more education you acquire the more genuine moral and ethical learning you acquire, you should be more humble, "When knowledge is profound, the mind becomes calm". These statements can all be used to test whether we are learning knowledge or true learning. When Bai Juyi laughed, “Even a three-year-old knows that,” did he realize that his thought was wrong? “So simple!” A heart of contempt arose. The Zen Master pointed it out, "An eighty-year-old man can’t do it."

This was in the Tang Dynasty. Several hundred years later, in the Song Dynasty, Mr. Su Dongpo felt that his self-cultivation had improved, and he wrote a verse: “I bow to the Celestial Lord; His radiance illuminates the universe.”  Looking at the Buddha, “His radiance illuminates the universe,” he felt that he could “be unmoved by the eight winds, sitting firmly on a golden lotus.” He had this four-line verse sent quickly via boat to his fellow cultivator, Buddhist Master Foyin.  After reading it, Buddhist Master Foyin wrote one word on it: “Fart.”  Then he had it sent back. It might seem a bit uncouth, but at times the uncouth can create an educational opportunity, of course, this is an expedient method to see if the other person can gain insight.

When Mr. Su Dongpo opened it up, he was furious; he had written such a beautiful verse, in such a high state, why is there only the word "fart"?  So he went as quickly as possible to find Zen Master Foyin to argue with him.  After getting off the boat, as he was entering the mountain gate, Zen Master Foyin had already written two lines there, waiting for him. To be frank, Zen Master Foyin understood Mr. Su Dongpo’s level even better than Mr. Su Dongpo understood himself. If he could not even see himself clearly, then what was he talking about his state or his cultivation? The two lines read, “Unmoved by the eight winds, one fart sent him across the river.” How could he be unmoved by the eight winds?  One word "fart" made him come rushing over in anger, how could he be unmoved by the eight winds? Therefore, we must not deceive ourselves in our thoughts and intentions.

When did Mr. Su Dongpo get moved by the eight winds? He was moved while he was writing it, by boasting of being unmoved by the eight winds.  Was that not showing off? Wasn't that one of the eight winds, “Gain and loss, praise and blame, honor and disgrace, and pleasure and suffering?” If you were unperturbed by the states of gain and loss, praise and blame, honor and disgrace, and pleasure and suffering, only then are you unmoved by the eight winds. When he was provoked by the word, made fun of, he couldn’t take it. In that moment, Mr. Su Dongpo did not see it; not seeing your thoughts is to deceive yourself. He even boasted about it to others, was that not deceiving others?

Therefore, there is a teaching from the patriarchs to often contemplate: "When the barrier of personal gain is not broken, one is alarmed by gain and loss; when the barrier of fame is not broken, one is moved by praise and blame.”  The desire for fame and gain is not easy to get rid of. In reality, as long as a person has a desire for fame and gain, he cannot be sincere, he cannot have a genuine heart. For example, if a principal cares a lot about the trophies he wins, that is a desire for fame and gain; his students may suffer sports injuries and he won’t care about it, because this desire will be an obstacle.  Furthermore, by being so concerned about winning trophies, will the children's health and their studies be delayed?

Let's look at fame and gain. Gain means whenever there are ideas of gain and loss, that is the heart of gain. If you like one person, and you hate another person, then you have a heart of gain and loss. If you like doing one thing, and you don't like doing another thing. When you face people, affairs, or environments, whether you like them or not means gain and loss, and it will give rise to afflictions. For example, when you are assigned to a class, and you think, "I dislike these children, can I change to another class?", these are thoughts that arise. As for fame, if we love fame, love face and are unable to break free, praise and blame will cause us to be sleepless for days.

Therefore, we should often observe our own hearts in order to subdue these habits. Especially when we are engaged in education, Mencius left a statement reminding us: "Everyone likes to be a teacher," which means it is easy for this habit to arise. Unless we have a high degree of vigilance, our arrogance of wanting to be a teacher will increase as we become parents, leaders, or teachers, and our habits will grow stronger.

If we reflect calmly, we will see that as people age, we do not necessarily become purer or wiser, because we become tainted with more and more habits.  Therefore, people who are truly awakened understand self-love: the more one lives, the more their habits fade and the more they let go of these impurities.  How can you tell this? You can tell from their smiles.  Children smile often, one hundred eighty times a day, but as adults, we smile less and less.  Why do we smile less and less?  As we have more desires, the suffering of not getting what we want increases; how can we still smile?  Therefore, we must understand the true meaning of life; what we can bring with us is our wisdom and the elevation of our souls. Once we understand these principles, we will know what to take and what to let go of. Without this understanding, we live our lives becoming less and less able to smile, and life has no meaning.

When we talked about being unmoved by the eight winds, for example, if we are older, a phrase reminds us: “Relying on one’s age and acting as if you are superior.” "When I was the principal, you weren't even born yet." "When I was a teacher, you were still just messing around.” When these words are spoken, the dignified manners of being a teacher are gone, as it has become arrogance. Therefore, Confucius said, "The elderly are cautioned to be wary of acquisitiveness." The heart of being worried about gain and loss is strong, and they often boast about their past. To be frank, a person who truly educates themself has only one purpose when they talk about the past: to enlighten others. Other than this purpose, they will not keep talking about the past unless the story will enlighten others. Otherwise, it will become boasting. Therefore, we need to observe our own hearts, to have a heart that is purely for the benefit of others, every word being for this purpose, with no other purpose.

Fourth, since we know that our thoughts and intentions are the place to work hard in our self-education, then which of our thoughts are the most serious? We should start from the most difficult area: thoughts of opposition. So, what do we do? The fourth key is to let go of opposition, let go of control, and let go of possession.  When we see these thoughts, we must first know that we are not showing self-love, that we are being obstructed by these evil thoughts. Then, we can gradually extrapolate. A person who has thoughts of opposition will bring disaster to their family, create disputes in their group, so how can they be of benefit to anyone?  But, often what we say on stage may incite the opposition and love/hate of others, and this is not appropriate. Our words should align with the classics and should be enlightening, respectful, and loving, not inciting thoughts of opposition.

We might have many of these three types of thoughts each day. Frankly, if you dislike someone, there is opposition within. Otherwise, we should see everyone as good people. People who are too strong in their attitude about right and wrong easily create opposition; when people are too focused on high and low, they tend to place themselves as high and others as low, and they look down on others. What’s the point of emphasizing right and wrong so much? Once wrong is done, helping them is what matters.

Especially when we are in schools, whether we are a principal or a leader. This self-cultivation extends to leading our teams, where the crucial selection of key personnel must not include those with oppositional personalities. If you choose such personnel, big problems will arise. Therefore, when selecting key personnel, it is important to look for those who have a heart of love and reverence; they must consider all actions from the angle of how to love and respect others, without looking down on anyone, and have such personality traits.  Frankly, where do you find such people? "Loyal ministers come from filial sons’ doors," when choosing personnel, we must first investigate their family situations. Truly. Where do talented people come from?  They come from families. It is not easy to cultivate a person after adulthood, and it takes longer. "Those who love their parents do not dare to dislike others; those who respect their parents do not dare to be arrogant to others." Because filial piety arises, their nature and virtue opens, and they will naturally love and respect others.  If you ask them not to love and respect others, it will be hard for them to do so.

I once heard of a principal who had a very strong sense of opposition.  When he disagreed with someone in discussing school matters, that opposition rose.  What was the result? The whole school became divided into two factions: one that supported the principal, and one that opposed the principal. You see, one thought of a leader caused the entire school to become restless. And there are thousands of students in the school. Every day, the principal and teachers are still engaged in such issues; it is truly failing the nation and society.  Frankly speaking. Therefore, when someone is an official or has a position of authority, they must calmly tell themselves, "Do not seek merit, but seek to avoid faults." The higher up the leadership is, one thought can affect the entire team’s atmosphere; how can one not be careful? Therefore, the *Classic of Filial Piety* (孝經) so eloquently explains that the highest leader of a group, the ruler, should "not be arrogant when in power, high but not precarious; control and regulate oneself carefully, and be full but not overflowing.” Self-demands must be higher. When you are arrogant, the harm it causes is incalculable.

In fact, the person the principal didn't agree with was a very valuable person. Why? Because he dared to speak directly to the principal, that person has courage. Therefore, if anyone speaks directly to you, you should first ask yourself: What is their purpose? They are doing it for the students, they are not seeking any gain. What was it that was blocking the principal? "He didn't save face for me."  He couldn't see that this person possessed the virtue of loyalty, someone who dared to speak frankly and make honest criticisms; it's not easy to find people like this in society now. It is not worth it to offend you, since I can still get a paycheck, so why should I offend you? If he didn’t have the heart for the students, would he act this way? Therefore, if the principal could recognize this teacher's loyalty, and with one thought change his mindset and be tolerant of him, it would be wonderful; the entire school's atmosphere would be completely different; the difference made by one single thought is so profound! When we hear this and see this, we feel great pity and it becomes a great reminder for ourselves in the future when we are officials or leaders.

This very loyal teacher also reflected that although his intentions were for the good of the students, his attitude was still too forceful. Therefore, everyone can reflect on themselves from each protagonist in every story; we can all learn something. Those who learn well can learn a lot from watching a good movie. (Parenthesis, good movies, of course.) Do not watch bad movies, as three years of learning will all be in vain. “It takes a year to learn well, but a day to learn bad things.” We must protect ourselves.

Letting go of opposition is important. A principal or leader "must be tolerant, then virtue becomes great; must have forbearance, then tasks will be accomplished." If you lose your temper, it will be hard for things to develop in a good way. How can you tell whether a person has virtue? Not by seeing how many classics they’ve memorized or listened to; those are all surface things.  What is the substance? “Observe virtue in tolerance.” The person's capacity, their ability to endure.  "All things are accomplished through tolerance." We see, first of all, that "all things," including one's self-cultivation, must be accomplished through tolerance. If someone cannot control their temper, it will burn up all of their merits and virtues, showing that they lack cultivation and are without practice. "One million obstacles open," once you become angry, a whole bunch of negative thoughts arise, obstructing you.  That is from one's own self.

By extension, if a family has no tolerance, and they are fighting every day, how can that family be harmonious? Therefore, the women of ancient times, or even just thirty to fifty years ago, traditional women who had traditional cultural educations, like our mothers, never got angry throughout their lives. That was an enormous stabilizing force for the entire family.


Okay, here is the translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow, as befits a professional book translation:

**Translation:**

When this extends to a school or an organization, if the leader often loses their temper, everyone’s enthusiasm is severely dampened. If you have great tolerance, accepting even when others say something wrong, those around you will admire you as a leader. If you can also readily accept good advice, gathering wisdom from all opinions, the work enthusiasm of everyone will be stirred up, and how could the undertaking not thrive? Things will "naturally succeed". "Observe virtue in forbearance, observe blessings in generosity." The more generous you are, the more blessings you receive. That’s why in traditional Buddhist temples, the first thing you see upon entering the gate is an image of the Song Dynasty Maitreya Buddha (the Laughing Buddha), with a large belly, symbolizing the need for great tolerance. Therefore, when learning traditional culture, the first thing to learn is tolerance. Secondly, one should always have a smile on their face.

Next, let’s look at the notion of control. When people have a desire to control, they tend to become domineering. Some women, through this domineering behavior, suppress their husbands, causing a kind of imbalance of yin and yang. I’ve observed that men whose wives are too domineering often become depressed. Furthermore, their sons tend to be weak. This is my observation, I'm not speaking randomly. When the wife is too forceful, the husband seems to become melancholic, and the child is very timid. If you ask the child about anything, they will say, "Ask my mom." Even about a graduation trip, they’ll say, "I still need to ask my mom, otherwise, she'll scold me." They lack masculinity. Why? Because they’ve been suppressed by their mothers. So, there needs to be a balance of yin and yang. Men should act like men, and women like women; the children they raise will then have healthy personalities.

What else does this control manifest as? It's an excessive desire for power, the feeling that everyone should listen to you. These all stem from the desire to control. One should shift this mindset to one of helping others achieve. Furthermore, if others don’t listen to us, we become unhappy. What should we change this to? Patience. Even if they don’t listen to me now, I will still treat them kindly and not get angry. Next, what should we transform the desire for power into? Gratitude for the efforts of all. We cannot assume that when others help us achieve things, it's just their duty. We should be grateful in our hearts for the contributions of each colleague so that we do not fall from grace in our leadership position. It's very easy for the desire to possess to arise. "You should do this for me, you should do that for me." Where does the desire to possess come from? From feeling that everything is due to us. Gradually, the desire to possess grows stronger and stronger: "You should give this to me." If they don't give it, you get angry. Therefore, those who do not know how to be grateful feel like everything is due to them, and their desire to possess becomes very strong. Thus, we must transform this sense of entitlement into a cherishing of everyone's efforts and every opportunity. Understanding conditions, cherishing conditions, creating conditions; knowing kindness, being grateful, repaying kindness. Only this is correct, and only in this way will we be able to improve ourselves in every event and opportunity instead of allowing ourselves to fall.

When are people most likely to possess? As mentioned earlier, it’s when we have a sense of “entitlement.” One time, a colleague of ours returned from giving a lecture, and a friend had asked them to bring me something. He was very commendable; as someone “entrusted with a matter, faithfully accomplishing it,” he went to my room right away, without even going to his own room, to give me the item, thus accomplishing the task. I was very grateful. I saw that he hadn’t even unpacked his luggage yet but had already come to give me the thing. Then he went back to his room. Neither of us noticed that when he took the item out, two jujubes fell out of his suitcase. Later, after some time, I saw the two jujubes in a corner. I immediately picked them up and went to find this colleague. He wasn't there at the moment, so I gave them to another colleague and said, “Please give these two jujubes back to so-and-so.” This colleague received the two jujubes and thought to himself: Teacher Cai is making a big deal out of nothing. It’s just two jujubes, why does she have to return them? She's being too polite! He had a lot of thoughts going through his head. In the end, he felt very uncomfortable and came to me, saying, "Why did you have to return the two jujubes? Isn't that making a mountain out of a molehill?"

This is good, he asked me directly when he had doubts. Where do most interpersonal issues arise nowadays? Someone sees something, and then they start to overthink it, and their thoughts become increasingly distorted and serious. Things that weren't problems become problems. Thus, we need to communicate directly and sincerely. Many problems didn't exist in the first place, they were simply created in our own minds. That’s why it’s good that he asked me directly. I said, because I am in this position, everyone treats me very well, and I cannot take it for granted. Therefore, these two jujubes, I cannot take as my own without his permission. I need to be cautious about my thoughts and motivations. Thus, this is not about two jujubes, it's about whether I can be aware of my thoughts and motivations in these situations, otherwise, I will fall.

When we were in Lujiang, the people of the whole country were really taking good care of us. We were in a rural area, and we were eating the best things from all over China, apples from Yantai, cherries from Dalian, all the best things were being sent to us. The elders from those places were caring for us as if we were their own children. We were in such favorable circumstances, but favorable circumstances can be the downfall of people. We were eating the best of everything, then one day someone brings something and we say, “Oh, this is not as good as last time.” That’s the end, we are ruined, without realizing it, like a frog being slowly boiled in warm water. We are falling while enjoying our good fortune. We must be cautious and protect our thoughts well. How can we make comparisons? Everything was given with people’s most sincere heart. We can’t eat the good things and then treat people’s sincerity with this kind of comparison. When I used to teach in Taiwan, students’ grandmothers would carry guavas that they had grown themselves. That could not be measured by money. Those were their most sincere blessings for us, giving us the guavas that they grew themselves. So, what we see is their genuine heart. We shouldn't just see the things. Therefore, as I said earlier, we need to see the essence and not become attached to the appearance. We need to see the nature and sincerity of their hearts, and not get stuck on the appearance.

And this desire to possess most easily arises in matters of love, called “love desire,” and in the things we are addicted to, called “addictive desire.” Are there principals or teachers who become obsessed with playing the stock market, and can they still run the school well? Or are there those whose desires are out of control, and they feel very uncomfortable if they can’t indulge in their desires or addictions, like being addicted to drugs? Yes, there are. People who like to gamble will feel like their lives are at stake if they don’t gamble. Those who like to smoke, those who like to play golf, they play to the extent that they don’t handle the important things that they should handle. We need to suppress desires, and restrain desires, or they will ruin the things we should be doing. Some people like antiques, and love them to death. They like those antiques more than their wives, so their wives become jealous of the antiques. That's also an addictive desire. This is terrible. If there's a next life, and one loves those antiques so much, what will that person become in the next life? An ant next to the antiques, because they can't leave them. Then it’s a problem, their spirituality will keep descending. Those who love to travel and enjoy the scenery, will say, “Oh the birds are so beautiful, the butterflies are so beautiful.” If there is a next life, they will become birds. When we become attached, then it’s no good. What is the purpose of travel and enjoying the scenery? It’s to increase our wisdom! “Supreme goodness is like water," right? "The heart is pure and white like a snow-covered mountain." Climbing the Himalayas is to cultivate our own pure hearts. Those who learn will see all of their interactions with people and things as cultivation of themselves, rather than being greedy and attached to people and things. Ah, last time I went to Chengdu, the noodles I had were so delicious. Even after three years, I still dream about it often.

The ancients left us a saying to remind us: “Do not let your addictions kill you, do not let your wealth kill your descendants.” If a person's desires are not restrained, there will be some people who like to play mahjong until midnight. That is a great detriment to their health, not only to themselves, but also their wives and parents will be worried and uneasy at home. If they leave a lot of wealth behind, that will only create conflicts among their children. Therefore, “Do not let your wealth kill your descendants.” That is wisdom.

Love desires are also very difficult to sever. Love and affection. If you ask what love is in this world, you shouldn’t ask at all. Let go immediately, don’t engage in it. Being deeply entangled and immersed in love will cause you so many problems, that you’ll eventually be tired of it and won’t want to deal with it anymore. What is this love desire? It’s demand. If you don’t get what you want, you feel resentment and hate. After the heated battles, it becomes a cold war. What is a cold war? It’s not speaking to one another, trying to make the other person angry. We should all understand that true love does not change. Where can you find true love? You can find it in your parents. How many times have we angered our parents since we were young? But they still love us the same way. That’s true love. Anything that changes or deteriorates—if they love you a lot one day, and hate you the next—that’s all fake and insincere. People these days don’t understand true love. They get married in the morning and get a divorce in the afternoon. Who has true love? A filial child has true love. "To not love one's own parents, but love others, is called violating virtue; to not respect one's own parents, but respect others, is called violating propriety.” It’s not normal.

In this section, we need to understand that love desire is not true love, it changes. Because why? Because they don't get what they want. They don’t receive the love they want. If you don't follow their will, they feel resentment and hate. Therefore, if you see a stranger, will you say, "I hate you?" You wouldn't. But why is it that you might say "I hate you" to those closest to you? Because of love desire. If one doesn’t get what they want, it changes. A chemical reaction starts to happen, love changes to resentment, resentment escalates to hate, and if hate becomes even more severe, then a tragedy occurs. Don't let things develop in that direction. Pull yourself back, pull yourself back. Often, tragic events occur because we didn’t cultivate and resolve the problem at the beginning.

Actually, if we resent or hate someone, we need to tell ourselves: “Ah, I don't have true love in my own heart. Why am I resenting anyone?” The love we have for others has changed, how can we have true love? We ourselves are being insincere and hypocritical, why are we resenting others? Therefore, those who can reflect on themselves can slowly bring their minds back to a place of right thought. If we can’t even do well ourselves, and we don’t have true love ourselves, why do we expect it of others? As long as we make demands, we will surely receive others’ complaints, because if you can’t do well yourself, how can you expect others to be compliant? Therefore, “Correct yourself without demanding it of others, and then there will be no resentment.” First, how do we correct ourselves? By restoring our true love and meaning, keeping our love and loyalty to everyone unchanged. Only this is using sincerity. Otherwise, we have no right to criticize others for being insincere and hypocritical.

This is what I wanted to discuss with everyone today about "educators must first be educated," these four main points I've shared. Next, the second main point, the focus of self-education is in “courageously correcting our mistakes.” The previous section used the teachings of these classical texts to help us understand our errors. We realized that even our thoughts have deviated too severely, and that we have too many shortcomings in our family and interpersonal relationships. We understand our errors, and we have acknowledged them. What should we do next? Correct them. It is not enough to know all of these principles but not change them. Then you haven't really understood.

The first point in courageously correcting our mistakes is to have a "sense of shame.” As described in the *Liaofan's Four Lessons*, there are people who can be recorded in history and who are seen as teachers for generations. Why am I so tattered and broken, full of so many habits and desires, that after I die, I will not have left behind any value. I have come to this world in vain. Once we think this way, a sense of shame will arise. In the *Vegetable Root Sayings*, there is a saying that has greatly encouraged me. “Place yourself amongst the sages and virtuous people of all time.” To be able to place yourself in the ranks of sages in this lifetime, “Do not be willing to be one who drifts with the waves.” Don’t be someone who follows the crowd, and don’t become decadent. This is to have a sense of shame.

When I see this sense of shame, I think of my teachers. When we first started learning in Lujiang, the old teacher encouraged us, "In the future, when you promote traditional culture and engage in educational work to the common people, remember: if you do it and then say it, you are a sage; if you say it and can do it, you are a virtuous person; if you say it but can’t do it, you are a deceiver." The phrase "a deceiver" has had a very deep impression on me. Sometimes, I might be in a place where people are playing recordings of our lectures, and I hear a few sentences, I suddenly reflect, these words are things that I have said myself, but I don’t seem to have done them. Then I break out into a cold sweat. When we are speaking to others, and suddenly one day, someone asks me: "Mr. Cai, you once said this and this, have you done it?" At this time, we must also face the truth, and say if we have done it. But if we haven’t, we need to say we haven't done it. But have we been earnestly striving and not being lazy in this direction? Have we been cautious and trying to quickly implement the teachings that we ourselves have spoken about before? This is extremely important for ourselves, otherwise, we will end up just talking for the sake of talking to others, and it will be over. We will just become fond of being teachers to others.

When the sense of shame takes effect, you will no longer find excuses for yourself when you’re correcting your mistakes. I remember when I was teaching a sixth-grade class. I had just made a mistake, and because I wasn’t cultivating well and was still far from good, I had a habit of explaining and making excuses. After saying a few sentences, I saw the children’s expressions. They seemed to be thinking, “I can’t listen to this anymore, I can’t listen to this anymore…” Seeing the children’s expressions, I also felt a bit of a jolt. Children are very sensitive. When we don’t admit our mistakes, and are just making excuses, we ourselves are not being sincere. Therefore, when they come into contact with that energy, it is like they can’t listen anymore. I immediately became aware, and I adjusted my mindset. I quickly bowed to them and said, “Teacher was wrong about this matter.” When I raised my head after bowing, wow, the students’ eyes were shining. So, if we tell our students so many classical teachings but do not do them ourselves, the students will lack faith. But if we truly use our hearts to implement the teachings step by step, it will give the students faith in the education of sages.

"A teacher’s role is to impart the Dao, teach skills, and resolve doubts." The faith that students and the public have in the teachings of the sages is built upon those of us who are promoting the Dao. Therefore, we should strive to have no errors. We must remember what the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "When one moves, one should become a guide for the world; when one acts, one should become a model for the world; when one speaks, one should become a rule for the world.” Our every word and action cannot deviate from the classics and morality so that we can bring about a good influence to society. If we have this kind of mindset, the motivation will be strong and we will not dare to be indulgent or reckless.

The second is to have a "sense of awe," a heart filled with reverence. Why? Because if we do not correct our mistakes, we will be giving our students a bad example and be cutting off their wisdom life. Before I started my teaching career, I had heard my teacher tell the story of the nineteen layers of hell and I developed a heart of reverence. I knew that I shouldn't mislead the students, that the sin was very great. But we shouldn't become so afraid of the nineteen layers of hell that we don't even dare to be teachers. That's going too far. If we use our sincere hearts, then problems will not occur. Therefore, do not listen to this and then become stressed. We should turn the stress into motivation. Because this mission is so important, we should be cautious and careful. This will help with our moral improvement. I often say that there is one benefit to teaching in school, why? If you say one sentence, there are thirty-plus students who are supervising you, and you don't even need to pay them a salary. They are all supervising you, how great is that? Right? One should know that they are in a state of blessing. It is not stress; it is a blessing.

The third is to have "courage," a courageous mind. Because if we do not develop courage, we won't be able to overcome a serious habit: being complacent and shrinking back. Mr. Liaofan very earnestly said, “There are so many people in this world who are intelligent and talented.” There are plenty of intelligent and talented people. "The reason why their virtues are not improved, and their achievements not expanded," meaning that in the end they still have no achievement, have fallen, and have become decadent, "is only because of the two words complacency, that they waste their lives." Therefore, we cannot be complacent, shrink back. We need to bring forth courage, and mercilessly eradicate all our bad habits. Mr. Liaofan gave an analogy: “Minor habits are like a thorn in the flesh. Quickly pull it out." "Major habits," the emergence of major bad habits, "are like a poisonous snake biting one's finger." What should one do if a poisonous snake bites a finger? If your life is at stake, you must draw the sword and cut off your finger. Otherwise, the poison will quickly reach your heart and you will die. Major bad habits can really cause an eternal regret. "Like a poisonous snake biting one's finger, we should quickly cut it off." We must have this kind of courage.

Secondly, only by having courage can we do what is righteous without hesitation. Once you have developed this courage, you will have a sense of righteousness: I cannot stand idly by. One day, I opened the newspaper and saw such a large layout, and there wasn’t a single good thing being reported. The first article was about robbery, the second was about a college student jumping to their death, and the third was about a seventeen-year-old boy threatening to kill his mother. His mother was so scared she searched his home and found homemade guns. After reading all this, this is what our Chinese people are experiencing now. "Taking the hearts of our ancestors as our own heart, there would be no discord among our people.” We have 5,000 years of wisdom. How have we come to live like this? Our ancestors in heaven must be weeping! I cannot be an unfilial descendant. I must do my best to turn this situation around, and do my best to introduce traditional culture to our Chinese people. Of course, our ancestors had the world in their hearts. We must introduce it to all the people in the world if we have the opportunity.

I remember a Malaysian woman who was not a school teacher, but after she encountered the teachings of the sages, she took the initiative to do what was righteous. She went to the UK for a few months once. She used this opportunity to introduce the *Standards for Being a Good Student* to the Chinese families living there. She went door-to-door to introduce it. Then, people came to attend her lectures, and after listening to her lectures, they were filled with joy. She also trained the parents, so that they could continue to teach even after she left. I was very moved by this; she did it all the way to the end. Otherwise, after she left, wouldn’t it have stopped there? She also helped train the talent, and saw it through to the end. We, who work in education in school, look at such a woman with utmost respect. She doesn’t even have a professional background, but her love and devotion surpasses many of us.

Next, let’s talk about after courageously correcting our mistakes, there is a guiding principle to guide us when we are correcting our mistakes. The third point: when correcting our mistakes, we must grasp the guiding principle. What is the guiding principle? "The Dao of Confucius is nothing more than conscientiousness and altruism." Once you grasp the guiding principle, you will understand it. In the context of conscientiousness and altruism, let’s use a phrase that we are all very familiar with to understand them. “Be strict with yourself” is conscientiousness, and “be lenient with others” is altruism. In the classics, we are told, “Exhausting all of your strength is called conscientiousness.” I ask you all, who should we be conscientious towards first? Our own conscience. Therefore, we must be strict with ourselves in order to achieve success. If you are only lenient with yourself, and make excuses for yourself, then you can only fall. Because if you are able to exhaust your efforts to achieve success for yourself, you will naturally be able to exhaust your efforts to help others achieve success. You will then be conscientious towards your parents, often advising them to help them achieve moral excellence. You will be conscientious towards your leaders. If your leaders are wrong, you will directly advise them to correct themselves. Therefore, we must start with being conscientious towards ourselves, loving ourselves, then being conscientious towards others, and loving others. To be lenient with others is to be forgiving.

Let's specifically discuss how we should be strict with ourselves. We should not be greedy, not be angry, not be foolish, not be arrogant, and not be doubtful. We must work on these thoughts that arise in our minds. To not be greedy. We say “the five desires and seven emotions”. The five desires are wealth, sex, fame, food, and sleep. Actually, why do people need to sleep so much? Those who sleep a lot lack direction and goals, and their sense of responsibility is very light. It is because they only eat and sleep, sleep and eat. People who truly have a sense of mission will slowly adjust their desire to sleep. Actually, we are not forced to let go of these desires. Because if you truly delve into traditional culture, you will realize, “To learn and practice them regularly, is this not a pleasure?” You will be very happy, and be filled with the joy of the Dharma.

For example, these years we have been studying, if we were to go to worldly entertainment now, it would be so meaningless. Isn’t that just degrading ourselves? After you have understood this, you won’t want to do those foolish things anymore. People these days seek pleasure in misery, because they can't resolve their worries, so they want to temporarily forget their worries, and they engage in revelry. Really, one year, a friend of mine called me, "Yesterday was December 31st, the day before New Year’s Day. We went to so-and-so place and stayed up all night to celebrate New Year’s Day." Come on, staying up late is unfilial, it damages your body. I just listened, and he said that he had stayed up all night to party and was very happy. Then he asked me, what did you do yesterday? I said, I listened to my teacher give a lecture. “Oh, your life is so boring.” Does eating spicy food mean that your life has flavor? Why don’t you eat the original flavors of food? Why must you accept that stimulation? Instead of eating the original flavor, that happiness will naturally flow from within. Why must everything be a form of stimulation? Stimulation is not real.

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural flow:

**Book Translation:**

Like dancing and dancing and dancing, only to sleep like a log the next day, what’s there to be happy about? Dancing too excessively will lead to "ouch, ouch," tomorrow, with an aching back and sore waist.

True joy doesn't turn into suffering. You swipe your card, buy a designer piece of clothing, that's enjoyable. Half your salary is gone, and then you're left eating instant noodles. That joy turns to bitterness. That kind of joy is not real. Real things don't change. When you are filial to your parents, genuinely doing your best, every time you think about it, you feel fulfilled, with no guilt towards your parents. No matter how you look at it, it’s joyful; how could it turn bitter? Therefore, true joy doesn't come from the outside. That's all just stimulation, similar to the nature of snorting cocaine; that desire will only become stronger and stronger.

Think about this, there's a saying that is wrong, it's not in the classics. You need to be able to distinguish it: that is, "A woman's wardrobe always lacks one piece of clothing." This saying is not in the classics. You need to be able to judge. The classics are the standard. Have you ever heard of a woman saying, "Okay, this is the last piece, I'm not buying any more from now on." Have you ever seen anyone who truly stops buying clothes like this? No. So, I'm telling everyone that those words are spoken out of excitement, they aren't real. "Just let me gamble one more time, just the last time." Those who truly want to let go do it right then and there, they wouldn't say "one last time"!

Frankly speaking, truly sensible people don't do those foolish things. They have self-respect, how could they still do things that harm themselves? So, to see through it, what does seeing through it mean? It means understanding principles. When you truly understand, you can naturally release your habits, without any difficulty. Still struggling and wrestling with it, that's not truly seeing through it. Therefore, the ancients told us, what are morality and learning? Knowing is difficult, doing is easy. It’s certainly like that, when you truly understand that something is harming you, you immediately discard it. Would you still continue to allow it to harm you?

Then, there are the five desires: wealth, sex, fame, food, and sleep. Think about it, when you are greedy for wealth, I feel that an official’s greed for wealth is different from a principal's or a teacher's greed for wealth. The guilt of a principal or teacher's greed is greater than that of an official's. Why? Because in addition to causing people to lose money, they will also cause students to stop trusting teachers, cutting off their spiritual wisdom. Because they dislike their teachers, they don't like to learn. This is not just a monetary loss for a student; the damage to their spirit is too great.

Therefore, the ancients said, "find peace in poverty and joy in the Way." Don't see this and think, "Oh no, are you asking me to go hungry?" That's not what it means. Find peace in poverty; the “poverty” here refers to a life of few desires. It doesn't mean they don’t have money, why? The blessings that are meant for them cannot be escaped. It's not that being a teacher makes one poor. Where does that idea come from? I ask everyone, was Confucius poor? No. He had so many students. But he did not indulge himself. He treated his students as his own children. If any of his students had difficulty, he would do his best to help them. Our teacher’s teacher, Teacher Li Bingnan, taught in Taiwan for thirty-eight years. He had 500,000 students, from government leaders to people in all walks of life, all were his students. He received so much offerings, but look at him, he ate only one meal a day. He was compassionate; he left more for others to enjoy. He gave his good clothes to students; he wore the same Zhongshan suit for thirty-eight years. When we go to the museum, we are really in awe of the museum! That set of clothes represents Teacher’s teacher's spirit, his frugality. And it still looks so new, it is truly admirable. Later I thought, if you love your clothes so much, your clothes love you too, they won't break down. If you really cherish it, after wearing it for thirty years, people will still ask you, where did you buy this suit? Vintage style! People who truly cherish clothes, sometimes after wearing them for ten years, they still look very new. Dr. Masaru Emoto did experiments, if your thoughts are good, the crystals of water are beautiful; if your thoughts are good, the state of your clothes will be different.

We must be very clear on one point: “A gentleman loves wealth, but he acquires it through proper means.” Those who take ill-gotten gains will surely suffer misfortune. “Acquiring unrighteous wealth is like using rotten meat to quench hunger, or poisonous wine to stop thirst.” "Rotten meat" refers to pork dripped on by rain, which will quickly rot and become poisonous. "Using rotten meat to quench hunger" means you will lose your life if you eat it. Don't look at the immediate ill-gotten gains; misfortune will come. "Poisonous wine," the character "poison" refers to a type of bird whose feathers are very toxic. If wine is soaked in those feathers, you will die if you drink it. “It doesn’t temporarily satisfy hunger, death follows immediately.” Even before you're full, your life is gone. Many people commit crimes now, and are sentenced to severe punishments, even the death penalty, all due to their greed for illicit wealth. In fact, they are meant to be very wealthy and prosperous people, but because they do not understand principles, they unjustly become petty people, squandering their blessings and even losing their lives. If they understood, "If it's meant to be in your life, it will eventually come," then they would “be happy to be a gentleman." What's meant to come will come. Why should I squander my blessings, be unfaithful to my conscience? As long as people are greedy for wealth and commit crimes, frankly speaking, from that day onwards, they don't know what true happiness is anymore. They don’t know what it’s like to have a good night's sleep.

There was a thief who, after stealing things, was very afraid of being caught by the police. He would often wake up startled by any sound. Later he was actually caught and imprisoned. The next day, the thief said, "Yesterday, I had the best sleep I've had in ages." Every day he was afraid of being caught. On the contrary, after being caught, ah, he had a good sleep. Actually, what is true happiness in life? It is "looking up without shame to Heaven and looking down without shame to man." Only by living according to your conscience can you have true happiness; otherwise, if you betray your conscience, you will be constantly worried and anxious.

Wealth, sex, fame, food, and sleep, this “sex,” the character for sex is like a knife on the head; it can lead to family ruin. The *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* remind us, “When seeing beauty, if you arouse lustful thoughts,” when people have too many evil thoughts, seeing female beauty makes them have lustful thoughts, “the retribution will be on your wives and daughters.” “A family that accumulates unwholesome deeds will inevitably have leftover disasters.” It’s very possible that they may attract their wives and daughters being treated disrespectfully. Our ancestors reminded us, “What comes from you, will return to you,” this was said by Zengzi. Nature is a cycle. There is no taking advantage, nor is there any being taken advantage of. If you hit someone, you are hitting yourself. Why? Because it will eventually return to you. You hit someone, a gentleman will not take revenge for ten years, so hitting someone is hitting yourself, cursing someone is cursing yourself, it will all cycle back.

The *Great Learning* also tells us— the *Great Learning* is coming again, so it’s a pity if you haven't read the *Great Learning*, the teachings inside are too good, it opens your wisdom. Cause and effect are in every single thing we do, in every thought we have: "Words that go out against reason, will also return against reason; Wealth that enters against reason," wealth that comes in by betraying your conscience, "will also go out against reason." It will eventually be lost; you can't keep it. Today if you have lustful thoughts, it will eventually come back on your family; it's a cycle. When people have this understanding, and they don't want to bring misfortune upon their wives and children, then they will restrain their desires, and not be greedy for sex.

Next, being greedy for fame, this is even more subtle than being greedy for wealth. For example, when we do something and want others to approve of it, this is also greed for fame. Being overly concerned about face, being unable to tolerate even the slightest misunderstanding, these are also greed for fame. People who cannot tolerate even the slightest misunderstanding or injustice will not accomplish great things. Why? They need to be able to bear humiliation and shoulder responsibilities! Now, because everyone hasn't learned traditional culture, of course, there are bound to be insults, misunderstandings, and slanders. Because everyone hasn’t learned, these attitudes are very normal. If you are scolded once by others, you are like a balloon that has lost its air; how can you accomplish great things? Therefore, you must also let go of fame. “Rather do great things, than be a great official,” which is to say, don’t yearn for fame.

And frankly speaking, is being scolded by others good or not? It is good. Firstly, it's practice for your skills, and secondly, they are sending you blessings. “When a person is without fault, and yet suffers from undeserved bad reputation, his descendants often rise rapidly.” If someone is without fault, and is scolded and slandered, their descendants will have a sudden rise in fortune. So, if your reputation is damaged and stepped upon by others, don't be sad; on the contrary, you will have blessings, and your descendants will have blessings. This principle is well explained in the *Liaofan's Four Lessons*. So, from today onward, when you are scolded by others, say “thank you for sending me and my descendants blessings.” Then nothing bad will happen to you, everything is good, and everyone is a good person; they are all sending you blessings. A person working in education, when everyone is a good person and everything is good, you see they are always smiling. People see that studying the *Disciples’ Rules* and the *Essentials of Governance* can make you smile like this, then they will want to learn. If you are scolded and you become gloomy and unhappy, people will say that you've become like this, don't learn anymore; it’ll be troublesome if you ruined the reputation.

This lesson, we will share with everyone here for now. Alright, thank you everyone!


Okay, here's the translation of the provided text, striving for accuracy and natural English flow, suitable for a book context. I've also added some stylistic choices to make it more engaging for a reader.

**Lecture 15: The Importance of Self-Education: Three Principles - Strict Self-Discipline, Forgiving Towards Others**

Esteemed elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

Our theme, "Being a Child's Lifelong Mentor," touched upon the seventh major point last session: "The Importance of Self-Education." Within this, we first emphasized "Educators must first be educated," stressing the need for constant self-reflection, self-motivation, and self-education. The second key point is to "Dare to Correct Mistakes"—having the courage to amend our own flaws and bad habits. Frankly, anyone who has been down this path understands that shedding a bad habit is like peeling off one's skin; the process is quite arduous. But when we truly let go of these habits, our body and mind can find genuine ease and peace, no longer controlled by desires and inclinations. This is why Confucius said, "To learn and practice them at due times"—the "practice" is about truly letting go of bad habits, truly putting things into action, and achieving inner joy and the joy of growth. It's about ceasing to treat a thief as a father, and no longer being controlled by bad habits.

The third major point, and the last one we touched on, concerned the guiding principle for correcting faults: the Confucian principle of "Conscientiousness and Tolerance," which is commonly expressed as "Be strict with yourself, and forgiving towards others." "Strict with yourself" reflects the principle of conscientiousness; to first be true to oneself, constantly reflecting on one's own actions. "Overcoming every thought to become a sage." The difference between a sage and a madman lies in a single thought. Turning away from a wrong idea, the real work lies in this initial rise of thoughts. Therefore, be strict with yourself. "Being forgiving towards others" is the principle of tolerance. Within this "strict self-discipline," self-love is paramount, because as the saying goes, "Learning to do good is never enough, while learning to do bad is easy to excess." So, we must cherish our moral character, protect our spiritual life, and never allow our bad habits to run wild, much less place ourselves in corrupting environments. As the *Standards for Students* says, "Un-saintly books, put aside; they obscure the intelligence and damage the will." Learning bad ways is easy to excess; it is very likely that we will absorb bad ideas and concepts, which are difficult to remove later. To make an analogy, a drop of ink falling into water takes but a moment; to remove that ink from the clear water requires ten or a hundred times more time.

We previously learned a saying from the *Essentials of Governance*, in the "Prudence" section, and we’ll review it: "Ascending to goodness is like climbing, while falling into evil is like collapsing." To do good, we must first let go of our own stinginess and greed, so that our actions can feel natural and joyful. So, at first, doing good is rather difficult; the “climbing” requires great effort. We must slowly grow accustomed to it. It’s what they call “forced at first.” Initially, making us not be greedy, generously giving to others, suppressing this greed—doing so will undoubtedly be very difficult. But after doing it for a long time, we will feel great joy, and it will become natural. “Falling into evil is like collapsing.” If we indulge even one wicked thought, we might regret it for the rest of our lives. Therefore, the word "strict" in "strict self-discipline" allows for no indulgence or oversight.

Cao Nai of the Ming Dynasty was the chief grand secretary (equivalent to a prime minister) under the Ming Emperor Yingzong. His moral character, knowledge, and status in life reached the highest levels. When he was younger, working as a clerk in charge of arresting and investigating prisoners, there was a female prisoner who was very beautiful. He was not immune to lustful thoughts, but he was very self-aware, and he sought ways to control it. It was night, and he picked up his brush, repeatedly writing four characters: “Cao Nai, cannot.” In ancient times, people used brushes, and this “Cao Nai, cannot,” was to suppress his wicked thought. He wrote it dozens of times. You can imagine, writing these four characters, each stroke must have been very forceful. By the time dawn broke, he had brought his mind under control. “Falling into evil is like collapsing.” We have to wonder, if Cao Nai hadn’t controlled his thought that time, would he have had the good fortune he eventually did? It was impossible. It could have very likely ruined his whole life.

Moreover, as parents, teachers, and even leaders, our every word and deed constantly impacts those around us. When does this influence occur? I once heard a joke about a father. His child was just born, and still babbling, and he was in a great hurry. He would often grab his son and say, "Say 'daddy,' say 'daddy!'" This was too hasty. Everything is best done when the conditions are right. Otherwise it's counter-productive. Like trying to force a melon to ripen, it won't be sweet. Everything should happen naturally. But he kept forcing his son to say "daddy." Later, when his son was able to speak, one day, the father saw his son outside, grab a chicken, and say to it: "Say 'daddy,' say 'daddy'!" So, the subconscious influence impacts children and students. This is why a teacher cannot have even a bad thought, and parents cannot even have a bad thought. For example, reflecting on our own childhoods, do we not know whether our parents were happy or angry on any given day? Were we not influenced? Of course! And now that we are adults, and elders, we must reflect on how we are constantly influencing those around us.

One mother, in a true account, said that she studied traditional culture very diligently. As a result, her daughter's situation was excellent, and she studied very diligently. Of course, there are ups and downs in a person’s learning process. Suddenly, her daughter became lazy for a period of time. She had caught "K-fever," and was binge-watching Korean dramas until two or three in the morning. Suddenly, she realized that her daughter had been unfocused in school, reading novels under her desk. She was shocked, how one of her behaviors immediately influenced her child. We often say that magnetic fields influence each other; her diligence had infected her daughter. When she became lax, her daughter followed her and fell. And the younger a child is, the greater the influence of the parents. Therefore, "strict self-discipline" also includes loving kindness for students and children. We must set good examples for them.

The same is true for leaders. If our attitude is humble and our capacity is great, that will be the culture of the team we bring forth. If our temper is bad and we are forceful, then the people under us will become like that. There is an adage for leaders, taught to me by Uncle Lu, "A lion leads sheep, and the sheep become lions; sheep leads lions and the lions become sheep." When lions lead sheep, eventually the sheep will all become lions. When sheep lead lions, eventually the lions will all become sheep. The impact from the top down is very significant. Why are people influenced by us? Because they trust us. People must live up to the trust of others. We cannot give others the wrong ideas just because they trust us. How can we be worthy? We would be failing the roles of "sovereign, parent, and teacher." I once heard a colleague say that a teacher’s influence is enormous. For instance, he was teaching a first-grade class and one day, a little girl came to school wearing pigtails. He casually said, "Ah, your pigtails look very nice." The next day, five or six little girls were wearing pigtails. You can see the extent of this influence and how trends catch on.

All right, as we were just talking about, even our thoughts, which others can't see, can influence students and children. Therefore, we must not be greedy, angry, ignorant, arrogant, or doubtful; we must "overcome every thought to become a sage," and work on those thoughts. Last time, we talked about not being greedy—not greedy for wealth, lust, fame, food, or sleep. In truth, the reason people have bad thoughts and engage in bad behaviors is that they do not understand the principles. If they truly understood, they would realize that those thoughts and behaviors will only bring them misfortune. Has anyone ever told you, "I love bringing misfortune upon myself?" No, right? Who doesn't want to seek good fortune and avoid disaster? Who doesn’t want to resolve calamities and attract blessings? But if they truly understand that these thoughts will bring misfortune to themselves and even their families, they won’t do them. As I mentioned last time, when officials are greedy for wealth, they can even harm people's lives, and ultimately their families may become extinct. Is there anyone who truly understands and would do something that would bring ruin to their descendants? As the *Zhu Family Maxims* say, "To have lustful thoughts when seeing beauty will bring retribution upon one's wife and daughters." If they truly understood, they wouldn’t want to bring disaster upon their wives and daughters.

Moreover, if they truly understood about being greedy for wealth, then what is destined for them is bound to come, so why use unjust means to obtain it? So, understanding principles is important. Reading is important; otherwise, we’ll do foolish things. As the *Zhu Family Maxims* says, “Though children may be foolish, classics should still be read.” Those who do not understand the principles are unlikely to avoid doing wrong and bringing misfortune upon themselves. Take a moment to look at the youth today. Without ethics, morality, and education about cause and effect, they are indulging their desires, causing very great damage to their minds, bodies, and their good fortune. Therefore, as teachers, we must think of the child’s entire life. These important concepts should be firmly implanted in their hearts now, to become the basis for their correct values. Why not be greedy for wealth? “If it is in your destiny, you shall have it.” "Just do good deeds, and don’t worry about the future." “If you want to know your future result, just look at your present efforts.” In fact, many people today, even if they are highly educated, do not understand this. But farmers understand it because they learn from the land and from nature—spring, growth, autumn harvest, and winter storage. How can you expect to harvest if you do not cultivate? Nowadays, in this era of profit-seeking, everyone wants quick results and to gain without working for it. These are all incorrect ideas and concepts.

As for craving fame, as I mentioned last time, this is specifically manifested as a need to save face. If we do something wrong today, we would really like to apologize, but can’t bring ourselves to do so—this is a need to save face. But is that truly what real fame is? The more we don’t apologize, the more people will look down on us, the more we will lack a good reputation. So, people who don't understand the principle are not actually looking after themselves; they're harming themselves. These are all bad habits, and we should let them go.

In the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, it says, "Fame is what the Creator abhors." Fame is not a good thing. If we have a bad attitude, then fame will become a burden, “harmed by an excessive reputation.” If our mindset is right, then we can use our fame to benefit the masses. However, if it's not used correctly, it becomes a burden. It’s like the saying, “People fear fame like pigs fear getting fat.” The *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* also tells us that this “what the Creator abhors” means that our virtue and reputation do not match, and thus we are squandering our good fortune. “Fame is also a form of good fortune.” If our fame is not in accordance with reality, then we will quickly lose our good fortune. There is a saying for this: “Virtue does not match one’s position.” Those who understand this principle, who would still crave a good reputation, or a fame that exceeds their actual achievements? Why bother! If one’s virtue does not match their position, then they will quickly squander their good fortune and disaster will come. There is a saying for this: “To die young, while famous.” Some scholars are very famous. Why? Because their abilities are excellent, their writings are excellent, everyone holds them in high regard, but they are lacking in self-cultivation. They’re harsh and critical, yet they have a great reputation. In the end, their good fortune might run out in their thirties, and they’ll pass away. This is very common throughout history. Therefore, when people become famous at a young age, they must immediately lay low and be very humble.

Take a moment to observe: Many celebrities in show business who become famous very early on, and who also act arrogantly, tend to die young. In particular, when they gain fame, their words and deeds lead to the creation of wrong social trends. They should be using their fame to inspire virtuous trends, but instead they create bad ones. Such people are very prone to losing their good fortune and their very lives. This “virtue does not match position” is easy to see in politics and show business, because their fame is so great. We have also heard about a major general who got inside information that he was about to be promoted to lieutenant general the next day. He was so happy that he invited all his friends and family to a celebratory dinner. He was having a wonderful time, and then he died that same day. Did he get promoted to lieutenant general? No. He found out a day early, but in the end, he was not promoted. The good fortune in his life was not yet accumulated to be able to become a lieutenant general, so he was crushed by the fame of the rank. Therefore, the ancients were reluctant to have great fame, and they often acted with humility. “Every line in the hexagram of humility is auspicious.” But those who crave fame often like to show off, which will often bring disaster.

Fame is a kind of responsibility, not something to cling to or boast about. For example, being the chairman of the board is a responsibility, because you have to take care of more and more employees. If we are in a position that we are not truly worthy of, we should not cling to the position. We should do what? Think about the group. We should give up that position to others, that’s the right thing to do. If you hold on to a title, you are burdened with its responsibilities. For example, if you are an official, that position brings with it responsibilities. Most importantly is to love and protect the people. If there is someone more virtuous and talented than we are, of course we should give up the position to them. This is our true intention. We’re not here to hold on to a position and forget about the people, are we? Therefore, the ancients taught us to act with respect and humility in all matters. “Give credit to the masses, give fame to those above you, give the position to the worthy, and give security to the elders.” Offer the best living environment to the elders, and let the children have the best food, because they are in a growth period. Parents and elders should eat less; in times of poverty, give it to the children.

Giving fame and position to the worthy is to consider the greater good; to be loyal to the country and the community; this accumulates great good fortune. Historically, in the state of Qi, Bao Shuya gave his position to Guan Zhong. As a result, Guan Zhong "united the princes and stabilized the world," even uniting the Chinese people and saving them from destruction at the hands of foreign invaders. Confucius greatly admired Guan Zhong’s achievements. Without Guan Zhong, our Chinese culture and our Han bloodline might have disappeared. Guan Zhong had such enormous accomplishments. Who created this opportunity? Bao Shuya. If he had not conceded, had not recommended him, this opportunity would not have come to pass. Therefore, Bao Shuya’s descendants were all famous ministers for more than ten generations. “A family that accumulates good deeds will have abundant blessings.”

If you do not concede when you should, you will bring disaster upon yourself. The reason a person doesn’t concede is because of their thirst for fame. What comes after that? Jealousy. If jealousy is severe, it leads to malicious schemes. Such evil thoughts grow ever more serious. Li Si murdered his fellow student Han Fei, because his fellow student’s knowledge was greater than his own, so out of jealousy he had him murdered. In the end, Li Si’s own descendants were all killed. There is a saying, “Promote the virtuous and be greatly rewarded; obstruct the virtuous and be severely punished.” In reality, this is the same for us today. In our schools, if we see that a teacher has a great philosophy, we should support and recommend them. This will greatly benefit the organization. If we don’t agree, but feel jealous, and try to slander them, then we are “obstructing the virtuous,” and we “will be severely punished.” Disaster will soon befall us. Therefore, in the course of our lives, if we are leaders of an organization, when we discover that there is someone better than us, we should actively promote them and give them the position. In ancient times, their education was very wise. The hats that officials wore were called "the promoting worthy hats," being low in the front and high in the back. If you watch historical dramas set in the Song Dynasty, you will see that their hats are low in the front and high in the back, “The later surpass the former.” It is a wish that those one recommends will surpass oneself; to choose the right people to serve the country. All right, this expands upon the idea of not being greedy for fame, and further into the self-cultivation that should be present in an organization, yielding positions to the worthy.

Wealth, lust, fame, food, and sleep; this “food” also encompasses the enjoyment of life. We must understand that "desires make the mind blind." The stronger our desires, the less wisdom we have. If you are thinking every day about what to eat, what to drink, what to wear, your worries become heavy, and how could you possibly have any wisdom? For instance, you are listening to a lecture, and suddenly you start thinking about your favorite coffee. Can you still focus on the lecture? You’re thinking, “What shall I eat later?” Your mind is elsewhere.

Moreover, desires are like a deep abyss; if we don't control our craving, we’ll sink deeper and deeper. Therefore, it’s best to be content and joyful with our lives; we should not compare ourselves with others. The moment we start comparing, our pursuit of material things will have no end. Why? Because comparing ourselves to others will only make us angry. Not only will we feel bad, we will develop a false sense of self-importance, comparing our sons to others’ grades, and our husbands to others’ income. The pressure on the entire family will be enormous. So, sometimes when people fall into the trap of desires, they can no longer think clearly. "It takes a hundred years to share a boat ride, and a thousand years to sleep on the same pillow." It is truly rare to find a family that lives under one roof. We should love and support each other, not impose heavy pressure on one another. Therefore, we must constantly keep our minds calm, and not go with the flow.

Those who chase after vanity will have very tiring lives, won’t they? Look at their clothes; they wear something once and then they change. If we study traditional culture, we will raise our quality. If we wear the same clothes fifteen years later, it will be fashionable again, and when people see us, they will say, “Wow, you’re so trendy!” Because we take such good care of our clothes, they still look new. And even more importantly, if you have a good quality, you can wear twenty-dollar clothing that will look like it cost four or five thousand dollars. If you don’t have good quality, a thousand-dollar piece of clothing will look like it cost ten dollars. If you don’t have quality, and you go out wearing something, people will say, "Look how much my clothes cost!" Then, you might fly into a rage. That’s what it means to invite humiliation upon yourself, so don’t blame others.

Therefore, if we are content, we will always be joyful. We should cherish and appreciate all things, living in gratitude, not extravagance. Frugal people have good fortune; they are kind. “Frugality is close to kindness.” Because they can use what they save to help others; this is kindness. Moreover, frugal people tend to plan for the future. Those who indulge their desires, they believe in "Drink today, for tomorrow you may die." They only see their desires, and they can’t think clearly about anything else.

That's what I have to say about greed. Of course, the process of subduing greed must be gradual. For instance, if you are trying to subdue your craving for sleep, you sleep seven hours now, but after hearing this lecture, tomorrow you only sleep for five. You’ve suddenly cut two hours of sleep, and the next day you’re groggy and almost get into a car accident. Don’t use too much force. You must be gradual. Some people who have high blood pressure, they still love to consume sweet things, which are very bad for the heart, and worsen high blood pressure. We must work on this, slowly changing it, gradually getting rid of it. All right, I will stop here; otherwise, next time no one will want to come to the course, and everyone will just say “Don’t force me.” Actually, once we let go of these desires, our mind and body will find ease and peace. That kind of joy cannot be bought in the world. When people then try to tempt you with these external desires, you won’t be tempted, because they are burdens, they are like stimulants. Without that stimulation, you are miserable. So, true joy does not come from the outside, but flows from naturally from within.

Secondly, we must not be angry. Not being angry means not flying off the handle. This takes a great deal of effort. This "anger" is extremely harmful to ourselves and to others. Firstly, rage damages the liver. So, people with bad tempers are usually unhealthy. Just think, if our bodies are damaged, how long does it take to recover from one bout of anger? Ms. Xu Zhe said that it takes her three days to recover. If it takes her three days, it might take us more than ten days, and then, after ten days, we see that person again, and we get angry again. So we are causing harm to our own bodies and minds. Frankly speaking, people with bad tempers are not filial. "Our bodies and hair are received from our parents. We dare not harm them, this is the beginning of filial piety.” How do we assess a person’s inherent goodness? If you tell them, “What you are doing is unfilial, what you are doing is letting your teachers down,” if they immediately stop, then that is a sign of true goodness. If you advise them, "Your attitude is wrong. This is not what our teachers taught," and they say, “Oh, I’m just a regular person, I can’t help it,” then they are saying that they are greater than their teachers, greater than the sages. How can they have goodness?

Therefore, a person with true goodness will know that without parents, there would be no “I;” without teachers and the teachings of the sages, there would be no spiritual life. These acts of kindness are more important than our lives! We could give our lives for our parents, so how can we say we cannot let go of a bad habit? Therefore, when people are grateful, their goodness constantly grows. Why do they still give in to their bad habits? Because they are too self-centered.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural English flow, while maintaining the original tone:

**Translation:**

"The ego is supreme, putting oneself above all others. Therefore, if people constantly think about whether their actions and thoughts are disrespectful to their parents, they should feel deep shame. Our teachers have painstakingly guided us for fifty-five years. How can I squander their efforts? We must follow their teachings and immediately correct our misguided thoughts.

Especially within families, a bad temper creates suffering for everyone. As the saying goes, 'Anger is like a raging tiger.' If one person in a family has a terrible temper, everyone may need to take three deep breaths before coming home, facing immense invisible pressure. If a teacher has a bad temper, the children have to be with that teacher for years, potentially leading to mild depression. We should cherish the fact that we’ve met, appreciating the bond. How can we give others so much stress?

Those who study the teachings of the sages should bring joy to others wherever they are. The first step is to get rid of a bad temper. A person with a bad temper inevitably worries leaders and parents. When a temper flares up, siblings clash, and parents suffer. When a temper flares up, people have to tiptoe around us when assigning work. Are we helping or causing trouble? Because we are teachers, we have multiple roles. When facing our supervisors or principals, we become subjects, and we must play that role well. This serves as a role model for children who will also become subjects and subordinates in the future. If a teacher cannot be a good subordinate, it is the cause, and the result will be that their students will not be good subordinates either. We must consider how this cause and effect continues. It's because our personal conduct sets a poor example. We've seen that if a school's teachers disrespect national leaders, the students from that school will also criticize national leaders. The karmic consequences are enormous. A moment of angry outburst can corrupt the next generation.

Alright, we must practice patience for our well-being, for the good of the group, and for the future. We must not create obstacles for ourselves. "A moment of patience can prevent a hundred days of worry." Otherwise, we will have to clean up the mess. After a temper tantrum, it can be difficult to repair damaged relationships. A person’s virtue begins with their ability to endure humiliation. "Observe virtue through patience, and observe fortune through tolerance." Fortune is related to our capacity to bear with things.

We know that having a bad temper has many disadvantages. So, we should be alert. A bad temper is a sickness of one's virtue. Since we need to cure this sickness, we have to find its root cause. Why do people get angry? For example, if someone is greedy and can’t get what they want, they will become angry. If things don't go their way, it's easy for them to get angry. For example, if someone enjoys a delicious meal today, but tomorrow their wife cooks something and they say, "I don't like this; it's worse than yesterday," hatred arises. Therefore, it's easy to become angry when things don’t go our way. Being overly concerned about face can lead to shame and anger, also making it easy to lose our temper. Furthermore, having prejudice against others and holding it in our hearts can cause us to take advantage of every opportunity to erupt in anger. You need to understand that you must cherish your own heart, not turn your pure, kind heart into a trash can. If you store other people's faults there, you are using your kind heart as a trash can. So, frankly, how many people truly cherish themselves? Only those who understand the truth can cherish themselves.

We must also understand that, "At birth, humanity is inherently good." Everyone has an innate goodness and shining virtue. "But what about their arrogance and greed?" That’s because "Without proper teaching, their nature will be led astray," These are acquired habits, not their innate goodness. If we only remember people’s bad behavior, we are mistaking the false for the real. This is not the real person; it’s an illusion. You say that person has a bad temper, but can you show me that temper? It is intangible. They only lose their temper when faced with certain situations. They are not always angry. If temper were real, it would exist all the time. What is transient is not real; only that which is eternal and unchanging is real. What remains unchanged? Their original, true heart. As long as they let go of these acquired habits, their true heart will manifest. Then they will be a sage; every action will be compassionate and benefit others. That is the inherent potential of everyone. "Sages and the wise can be attained through diligent effort." If we firmly believe that anyone can become a sage or a wise person, we will not have prejudices against others. We will only help them change their habits. Therefore, the difficulty lies in understanding the true nature of the universe and human life. Once we understand this, we will certainly adopt the correct attitude in our interactions with others and have no prejudice. When others make mistakes, you will worry more about them and help them. You'll skillfully use many methods to assist them in improving.

Furthermore, arrogance also easily leads to anger. When arrogant, we look down on others, making it easy to criticize them. We must transform these mistaken attitudes.

Since we know the root cause of this illness, what medicine can we use to cure it? There are six ways to practice "patience":

"Forced patience" - suppressing anger. This provides temporary relief.
"Forgetting patience" - letting it go and not dwelling on it, as it is said, "a prime minister’s belly can sail a boat," meaning be tolerant.
"Reflecting patience" - reflecting on oneself. When people get angry and clash, as the saying goes, "it takes two to tango," so when there is a clash, both sides are at fault. The truly cultivated individual will not get angry regardless of how poorly the other party behaves. If conflict arises, both sides must have been at fault. Someone might ask, what if one side is completely blameless and the other is completely at fault, then what? The completely blameless person will ultimately become a saint or sage. Do they suffer a loss? You see, we tend to look at things from the surface, only from one moment. For instance, Shun's parents tried to kill him. We might think that Shun was very pitiful and his parents were terrible. However, Shun still felt it was his own fault and that his parents were not wrong. Did he lose out? If it were us, we would have jumped up, saying, “I did nothing wrong, and yet you want me to apologize? I’ll fight them!” But what would we gain from fighting? Shun even reflected upon his faults when he was innocent, and ultimately, he became a sage. His wisdom, virtue, and blessings were all perfected. He became an emperor, so how could he be considered at a disadvantage? Therefore, when learning the teachings of the sages, we must first learn to take losses. We should not argue or be calculating. This is reflective patience.
"Observing patience" - Observing that their bad temper is false and fleeting, changing moment to moment. Once you see that, you will not dwell on it. You should observe their background, their childhood, and their lack of love and education. Not only will you not be angry with them, but you will also feel compassion for them. In our experiences teaching classes, when we initially felt a child was being excessive, after learning more about them, that they were abandoned by their parents, we could not be angry with them.
"Joyful patience" - turning anger into joy. Instead of getting angry, shift your mindset and smile. Why? Suddenly, you realize they are there to remind you. Even after eight or ten years of learning, your temper is still so bad, they are your exam proctors. You should be grateful to them. You see how deficient you are and immediately turn anger to joy. You see everyone as a teacher, there to help you develop. That is joyful patience.
"Compassionate patience" - thinking for the other person. For example, Liu Kuan's wife never saw him lose his temper his entire life. So, she arranged for a maid to accidentally spill hot soup on his official robes, right before he was to go to court, to see if he would lose his temper. People sometimes do silly things when they are too full…though, perhaps what his wife did was a little pointless. However, thinking back, it was rather meaningful. If she had not done that, the story would never have been told, so we still need to thank his wife for arranging this scene. If that had happened to most people, they would be thinking, "I have to go to court! Oh, this is so hot!" And their temper would flare. The "I," that’s what leads to anger. Without "I," there is no anger. We said we needed to find the root of the problem. To catch the thief, we need to catch the king. Who is the king of the thieves of greed, anger, delusion, arrogance, and doubt? It is “I”, selfishness, self-interest. “Like cutting a poisonous tree, cut straight at the root.” Cut the root, and these habits will have nothing to attach to. This is what “Liao Fan's Four Lessons” teaches us: go straight to the root and cut it off. Why didn't Liu Kuan get angry? In general, it’s hard not to. Because he thought of her first, his first thought was, "Did you burn your hand?”

I think I've mentioned this before about a Singaporean daughter-in-law. Her husband was full of admiration for his wife, and even said that sometimes when his mother wrongly blamed his wife, his wife would kneel down and apologize. Even though she was not at fault and was misunderstood, she still knelt down to apologize to her mother-in-law. Ladies, when we hear this, could we do that? It seems we can’t do it from a behavioral standpoint, but when we contemplate it from the heart, it is not hard to do. “When admiring the virtuous, admire their hearts.” If you imitate the heart of these virtuous people and sages, it is not actually difficult. Why? Because the heart of a sage is inherent in us. Once we are in alignment, it’s easy to do. But if our mind is not in the right place, then it's difficult to force ourselves to do it.
At that moment, this daughter-in-law responded to her husband, saying that she didn't feel wronged at all. Because an elder in the family is like a treasure. A mother-in-law is a treasure in the family and a field of blessing. Without a mother-in-law, how would we teach our children about filial piety? Therefore, when seeing her mother-in-law angry, she worries about her health, and her immediate thought is how to calm her down. She kneels down, and the mother-in-law's anger subsides. She did not feel wronged; she felt at peace. That is compassionate patience, constantly thinking of her mother-in-law.

Think about this calmly. When a daughter-in-law kneels down and apologizes, would that drama continue? Yes, it would. Most people would say, "I feel wronged and sad." But you must watch the whole play. After this daughter-in-law kneels down to apologize, in a few days, wouldn’t the truth be revealed? Most people can’t tolerate temporary grievances, and they let their anger flare up, making the situation worse. If you endure, time will reveal the truth. Why do we have to fight to the death, arguing right and wrong? That is due to vanity or arrogance, thinking that we are right and superior. Otherwise, relatives should be gentle and know how to yield. A mother-in-law later realized that she had been wrong about her, and yet her daughter-in-law had knelt down to apologize to her. She thought such a daughter-in-law is like finding a pearl, a treasure. Wouldn't she love her even more? This compassionate patience caused a mother-in-law to gain another daughter and a daughter-in-law to gain another mother. Isn't this changing the entire atmosphere and destiny of the family? The sages teach us to transform others by touching them with our actions. This is how one transforms the family's destiny.

Alright, this is to tell you that anger must be controlled and cannot be relaxed at all, or we will regress. Looking back calmly, were our tempers better when we first began studying traditional culture, or are they better now? We must evaluate ourselves. We have the conditions for learning, but if we do not put great effort into overcoming our habits, they will continue to grow. We must be careful.  There was a great Confucian scholar in the Ming Dynasty named Xue Xuan (also known as Xue Wenqing). He lamented that "After twenty years of working on controlling my anger, I have yet to completely eliminate it, and this shows us how difficult it is to control oneself." To overcome our bad habits, we cannot think about success or failure, life or death. “Oh, I lost my temper again.” Sometimes, we are unable to restrain ourselves, and we get discouraged and frustrated. That is still our old habit. That means we have begun to doubt ourselves. Therefore, “Do not focus on success or failure.” As long as we have made mistakes, we shouldn’t worry about our thoughts arising, but only worry about a delayed awareness of it. We need to correct it immediately. Why waste time feeling frustrated? Don't think about success or failure. We should fear having a wrong thought more than death itself. So, to control anger today, we have to work hard. But if you lose your temper again, face the truth, sincerely admit your mistakes, and apologize to the person, then you are on the right path. Otherwise, if you try to cover up your temper tantrum, you are just “adding another fault to your transgression.”

Third, do not be deluded or foolish. Primarily, this manifests as knowing that all things in the world are interconnected through cause and effect. You deeply believe in cause and effect. For example, in "Standards for Students," "When you receive praise, be fearful. When you hear your faults, rejoice." "Rejoicing at faults" is the cause, and the result is "upright and honest people will become close to you." "Being able to be near the virtuous" is the cause, and "Virtue will improve day by day and faults will diminish" is the result. “When your parents call, respond without delay” is the cause, and obeying your leaders when you go out to work is the result. All things are related by cause and effect, “plant melons and you will harvest melons, plant beans and you will harvest beans.” Therefore, “Families that accumulate goodness will have abundant blessings.” Accumulating goodness is the cause, and abundant blessings is the result. From a broader perspective, the fact that our nation has lasted for five thousand years is because our ancestors were virtuous. People who are grateful will not be foolish; they will not take blessings for granted. If everyone deeply believed in cause and effect, they would be careful about their thoughts, words, and actions. They would not be reckless. If you have deep faith in cause and effect, you will not be emotional or act impulsively. Impulsive behavior is irrational and foolish. When a person acts impulsively, they are not being self-loving; they are damaging themselves.

Liao Fan said that many people have excellent talents. "There are many intelligent and talented people in the world," but why don’t they have many achievements in this life? "The reason why they fail to cultivate their virtue and expand their abilities is because of the two words, 'laziness' and 'delay'. These two words delay them for a lifetime." Acting impulsively means following our temper and nature. If we are self-loving, we should remind ourselves of our mistakes and not make them again. That is the behavior of a rational person, someone who is not wasting their time.

We’ve all heard that Yan Hui never made the same mistake twice. What does that have to do with us? It has a great deal to do with us! Continuing to make mistakes diminishes our blessings and wisdom. So, we should follow the spirit of Yan Hui. We may not be able to completely avoid making the same mistake twice, but we should still have that spirit. After making a mistake, we need to remind ourselves strongly not to make it again.

For example, some of the small things in life. When using a fountain pen to write, if you don’t put the cap on, it might roll off the table and the nib will hit the ground, ruining the pen. This will make you feel very sorry. I had a very good pen that was ruined this way, and I felt terrible and sorry to the friend who gave it to me. So I vowed not to allow that situation to occur again. The more I remind myself, the more it becomes a habit. Even when someone is talking to you, immediately put the cap back on. Otherwise, as you talk, your focus might shift and you’ll forget, and the pen might fall again. If you put the cap back on, you won't have to worry about anything.

This also includes our constant need to cherish all life and not accidentally kill any living creature. “Watch where you step for insects and ants.” “Even insects, grass, and trees, should not be harmed.” Cultivate a compassionate heart. Although we have learned these principles, sometimes when we are in a hurry, we become impatient. If we wake up in the morning very thirsty and press the button on the hot water dispenser, an ant might be playing at the dispenser’s opening, and by pressing the button, we accidentally kill three or four of them. Oh! I didn't live up to this principle. These three or four ants use their precious lives to remind me that I’ve not fulfilled the spirit of compassion, and I shouldn't allow that to happen again. So, we must stay calm. Every time we press the button, we have to tap the opening to say hello, look to see if any are there, and then press the button.

Don't look down on these small details. When you remind yourself to not make these mistakes again, your heart will become more respectful, more subtle, and more cautious. “Great things are always made up of small parts.” Cultivate your true heart and love in these small details, otherwise, learning becomes just knowledge that doesn’t enter into your life. “Standards for Students” says, “Slowly raise the curtain, do not make a sound.” Just recently, I was using the curtain, and when I pulled it, the plastic hook broke off, and the curtain fell down. I realized that even fulfilling just one line from “Standards for Students” was not easy. So, at that moment, I had to resolve myself to correct it. We might have the thought, “This hook was already loose. Anyone would have broken it.” This thought is “adding another fault to your transgression.” Frankly, when one hook broke off, two or three more broke off after a couple of days. This means my actions were too rough and not gentle enough. So, the curtain was my teacher, reminding me that my heart was very deficient. Luckily, a classmate from the school, Mr. Yang, fixed it for me. I cherished his kindness, and from that day onward, whenever I use the curtains, I am very gentle... Until now, it hasn't broken again. But you can see how much using a curtain has helped me. From this small action, I learned that everything we do and every word we speak requires being gentle, not rough. Those who learn well can extrapolate one thing to all things. They apply this way of thinking to everything; this is a person who is good at learning. If you only learn just one thing, that is just learning knowledge, which is much too rigid.

Furthermore, when we can’t find something, it is because we have not implemented the principle of “Place clothes and hats in their proper place.” Therefore, if you cannot find something, you must ensure that you do not make the mistake again, and you must correct it. You must not say, “Tomorrow and tomorrow, and tomorrow never ends.” We must not say, “I will leave it for tomorrow,” “I will wait for tomorrow to do it.” “I am waiting for tomorrow, but all things are delayed.” Dropping things was something I would do often. So, I’m constantly reminding myself, and I’ve even used methods to change. For example, before leaving a room or any place, get in the habit of checking before leaving. That will improve the situation of dropping things. That is how changing ourselves is to not be deluded.

Furthermore, the third important point about “not being deluded,” and these points are experienced differently by everyone. To be honest, there’s nothing that isn’t related to “not being deluded.” Why? Not being deluded means having wisdom. So, where is wisdom expressed? Anytime, anywhere, in any action you take, it is either delusion or awareness. Therefore, these examples are just to share. In fact, every action that we take is either delusion or wisdom, and we must examine ourselves carefully in every detail.

For example, in choosing our activities. Many places are holding forums. This is good, but we need to understand that forums are for publicity and planting seeds. We must not think that “holding a forum is equivalent to cultural revival.” This is an incorrect idea and must be adjusted. Would a farmer say that planting is the same as harvesting? No, right? After planting, what do we do? We need to fertilize, water, and work hard. Moreover, “It takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred to cultivate a person.” Teaching cannot bring short-term results. Hurrying is not consistent with education. We must wait for the right conditions and a time of maturation. Therefore, we must understand each activity's purpose and what it can accomplish. Holding a lecture is for planting seeds and publicity. Next, we need to guide everyone to take root. We need to establish a foundation for virtue, and we must apply the classics. This is the essence of learning traditional culture. Because without implementing it, they are only learning traditional culture as knowledge. When you only learn knowledge, there are side effects. "If we do not practice what we learn, but only study texts, we will become boastful, and what kind of person would that be?” It might even increase arrogance. Not only will they not be able to promote culture, but it will be detrimental. Therefore, Zengzi in the "Analects" said that, "It is the person that brings the Dao into practice." They need to implement it and live it. Then, they can transform others and move family and friends around them. But to rectify oneself, we must first eliminate these habits of greed, anger, delusion, arrogance, and doubt. There must be a process and hard work. Furthermore, we must continuously cultivate ourselves. "If one does not read books for three days, one’s countenance becomes displeasing.” Without reading scriptures or listening to them, bad habits cannot be restrained. That’s what the ancients said. We cannot go a day without reading the scriptures. Then our countenance becomes displeasing."

**Key choices I made as a translator:**

*   **Natural Flow:** I tried to use phrasing that sounds natural in English, avoiding a word-for-word translation that could be clunky.

Okay, here is my translation of the provided Chinese text, with a focus on accuracy and readability for a general English-speaking audience:

**What is Necessary?**

What is necessary? He needs to sow seeds, he needs to host forums. First, consider if the local area can provide media (television stations) to broadcast programs daily. If it can, currently in many places in mainland China, traditional culture programs have been broadcast for several years. Once this forum is concluded, everyone can continue to learn through television. Therefore, wise people, when initiating a connection, will look very far ahead. They don't just start something without thinking about what happens next or taking responsibility. Thus, there needs to be this kind of media that allows the general public to be influenced and learn long-term.

Alternatively, when hosting a forum, announce where there are long-term educational centers that offer lectures. This way, people in the community who are willing to learn can go to these educational centers for long-term study. This center becomes the support system, nurturing the opportunity for the public to learn long-term.  This educational center then takes on the role of fertilization and watering. Moreover, this educational center also needs to guide everyone on how to integrate the learning into their own lives, into their families, into schools, into their workplaces, and into their communities.  If the educational center is committed to doing good to the end, it also needs to guide the local area in establishing role models in all sectors.  There are community role models and school role models. People in this area can learn from these role models. Then, these support measures become very complete.

However, if you host a forum with thousands of people attending, but there is no follow-up after the event, the initial enthusiasm will quickly cool down. Therefore, when initiating an event, you need to consider its long-term development. An old saying goes, “If you can’t look a hundred years ahead, you cannot be a prime minister.” You can’t just do whatever comes to mind; you need to think comprehensively and long-term.

This includes the teachers you invite. They must be selfless and dedicated, not seeking fame or profit. Why? Because when they stand on the platform, they represent Chinese culture. The general public hasn’t deeply studied the classics. Where does their confidence come from? It comes from the people who are teaching. If they observe over a period of time that the teachers being invited are all chasing fame and profit, they may think, “Forget studying traditional culture!” Then their faith will be undermined. So, when we invite people to lecture, we must understand them well, ensuring they are genuinely not seeking fame or profit, and that they can set a good example in the area. To be frank, this is not only for the good of the people, but also for the good of the lecturers, so they don't set a bad example and have a negative impact on others. They would also be creating negative karma if that were the case. When handling public affairs, we can't be afraid of offending people; we should not be swayed by personal feelings. Also, when you invite teachers, bear in mind that traditional culture is based on mentorship, with teachings passed down from teacher to student. If they don't have a good teacher or a clear lineage, it’s impossible to truly learn traditional culture. If the teacher is too easily praised, they will slowly become arrogant. They will start saying whatever they want, instead of adhering to the classics. But someone with a lineage will speak according to the classics and according to their teacher's instructions, and won’t dare to speak recklessly. Confucius set a good example for us: he “transmitted, but did not create.”

This is what I wanted to discuss with everyone regarding making decisions on different opportunities.  This includes choosing your life partner; it should all be done objectively, calmly, and without ignorance. That’s what I’ll share with you today. Thank you everyone!

**Translator’s Notes:**

*   **Nuance and Cultural Context:** I’ve tried to maintain the conversational and slightly didactic tone of the original while making it natural in English. The text is clearly part of a speech or lecture.
*   **Key Concepts:** The translation aims to capture key Chinese concepts, like “縁分 (yuánfèn)” translated as "connection," "opportunity," and “緣分” related to long-term development, while making them understandable to an English-speaking audience. The concept of "薰習 (xūnxí)," translated as "influenced and learn long-term," is important as well.
*   **"Role Models":** The translation used “role model” which encapsulates the idea of "榜樣" to represent those people that others can follow.
*   **“述而不作 (shù ér bù zuò)”:** The translation maintains the direct translation of “transmitted, but did not create,” as this concept of Confucian humility and adherence to tradition is central to the speaker’s point.
*  **“不為名、不為利”:** Translated as "not seeking fame or profit," maintaining a concise translation while encapsulating its meaning.
*   **"師承":**  Translated as "lineage", "mentorship," or "teachings passed down from teacher to student" to reflect the importance of the teacher-student relationship in traditional Chinese culture.
*  **"造罪業":** Translated as "creating negative karma" maintaining its meaning.

Okay, here's my professional translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a natural English tone, while respecting the nuances of the original Chinese:

**Lecture 16: The Importance of Self-Education: 3. Be Strict With Yourself, Lenient With Others**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

In our last class, we discussed “being strict with oneself and lenient with others.” In being strict with oneself, the internal work we do focuses on not being greedy, not being angry, not being foolish, not being arrogant, and not being doubtful. First, let’s look at “not being greedy.” If greed cannot be subdued, we become slaves to desire. How then can we possibly educate students well or influence others? We would be trapped in the pain of our own desires, unable to awaken ourselves, and thus incapable of awakening others. All suffering arises from greed. The pain in life, frankly, stems from not getting what we want. An infant laughs 180 times a day. A colleague of mine, whose child is a little over six months, said it was more than that, she had counted. Infants laugh so much every day, yet as adults, we laugh an average of less than seven times a day. This is fundamentally because our greed is constantly increasing, causing more and more pain from unfulfilled desires.

If we are no longer greedy, we will joyfully accept all circumstances—favorable and unfavorable, good and bad—and our greed will gradually diminish. "Every day is a good day, every moment a good moment, everyone a good person, everything a good thing.” We will happily accept our relationships, our environment, and our possessions. No matter who or what we encounter, it is there to help us grow. In this state, we will no longer have distinctions of good or bad, of like or dislike. If we joyfully accept every situation, it will not disturb our pure mind. When the mind is calm and pure, wisdom arises and afflictions cease. Therefore, we must work hard to subdue our greed. Confucius said, "A gentleman does not seek fullness in food, nor does he seek comfort in his dwelling." He did not deliberately pursue material enjoyment, knowing that this would only increase his greed, blinding his wisdom. That is why Confucianism emphasizes starting with “investigating things,” and the first step in this investigation is subduing greed.

Furthermore, people are sometimes not just greedy in the present moment but also worry about the future—which is also a form of greed. As the saying goes, "daydreaming" is also a form of craving for the future. Therefore, whether it is hoping for or worrying about the future, we must first understand the truth: “If you want to know the future, ask about your present efforts,” and “Just do good deeds and don’t worry about the future.” There is no need to fret about the future; the present and the future are inseparable. As farmers say, "You reap what you sow."

We realize that educators must teach and transform students and human hearts. The character for “teach” (教) consists of two “X” symbols on the left, and below, a child. This emphasizes teaching by example. Doctors treat the illnesses of the body, while teachers treat the illnesses of the soul. That is why the world respects teachers and calls them “engineers of the human soul.” So, what is wrong with people’s souls today? The most serious problem is selfishness. Not thinking of parents, not thinking of others – that is the problem of today’s students and the people of our era: selfishness. How do we cure this illness? By selfless dedication, we heal selfishness.

I vividly remember that in 2003, shortly after arriving in Haikou, I gave a lecture on traditional culture at a middle school. At the beginning of the two-hour session, the faces of the middle school students were not pleasant. They were forced to attend the lecture on traditional culture. A large number of them were holding textbooks, thinking they would just sit there and wait until I started speaking before they started reading them. However, children are simple by nature, and these teachings of our ancestors resonate with humanity and with the innate virtues within us. They became more and more interested as they listened. At the end of the lecture, some students wanted to speak. One student raised his hand and, as he spoke, started to cry. He said, "I heard from the school leaders that this teacher isn't charging for the lecture." This student had a deep impact on me. Just the fact that I wasn’t charging was enough to make a child cry. Doesn't this prove that “at birth, humans are naturally good”? Perhaps, in the ten-plus years of his life, he had mostly experienced the phenomenon of chasing profits and abandoning principles. Did he want to be like that? He did not. So, a small act on our part can move these children so deeply. This proves that people can indeed be moved, but we have to be sincere. The illness of society is selfishness, and we must counter it with complete self-sacrifice.

Professor Toynbee said that “to solve the social problems of the 21st century, we must rely on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and the Mahayana Buddhist teachings.” The teachings of Confucius and Mencius focus on benevolence and righteousness – which are selfless. The Mahayana Buddhist teachings focus on compassion and concern for all living beings. Professor Toynbee stated that, in his research of human history (he was a world history expert), he found three people who were completely selfless: first, Shakyamuni Buddha. For those of us engaged in education, Shakyamuni Buddha is our teacher. He taught for forty-nine years without interruption, giving lectures for eight hours a day. The Guinness World Records should recognize Shakyamuni Buddha as the world’s greatest teacher. Have you ever heard of a teacher teaching for forty-nine years, eight hours a day, every day? No, not even on the first day of the Lunar New Year, not even on Lunar New Year’s Eve. Second, Jesus Christ. He suffered for the people, being nailed to the cross. Third, Gandhi (of India). Gandhi achieved his nation's independence through peaceful means. Think of how many lives he saved? He is also worthy of our respect.

Professor Toynbee expressed hope that the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, and the Mahayana Buddhist teachings, could save the world. He also cited these three role models. I believe that, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we should have a sense of direction and purpose. We must be selfless, never greedy. We should be content with life: having enough food, enough clothing, and a house to protect us from the wind and rain – that is enough. If we expend our energy on material pleasures and pursuits, our spirituality and wisdom will decline. When a person's spirituality is truly elevated, their delusions decrease. One or two meals a day is enough; there is no need to consume so much energy. Therefore, do not be afraid when you read about Yan Hui who lived with only a bowl of rice and a ladle of water. In fact, that kind of life is extremely free and at ease.

Next, let's discuss "not being angry," not harboring hatred and not losing one's temper. *Geyan Lianbi* says, “Anger is like fire. If not suppressed, it will spread like wildfire.” If we don’t subdue our anger, it can engulf the whole grassland, destroy the whole forest. Many people, unable to control their anger, end up divorced with their families broken. This happens often. Our ancestors taught us to "control desire" – to restrain greed, and to “punish anger” – to subdue our anger and avoid hatred.

Last time, we discussed the “six forms of tolerance”: forceful tolerance, forgetful tolerance, reflective tolerance, insightful tolerance, joyful tolerance, and compassionate tolerance. We must understand that greed, anger, foolishness, arrogance, and doubt are all based on the “I”: “my” greed, “my” anger, “my” foolishness, “my” arrogance, and “my” doubt. These afflictions have a kingpin. As the saying goes, "to catch the bandits, first catch the king." By severing our egocentricity and constantly thinking of others, we will not become greedy, we will not become angry, and these bad habits will not arise. This is the approach of those with high wisdom who go straight to the root. Let's start practicing today: constantly thinking of others. We might have a sudden realization about the root cause of these issues, “it’s the ego.” However, the practice must be gradual. We must become aware in each moment and in every interaction: “Ah, there is my anger again, there is my greed again.” We should then let it go and think of others.

Third, “not being foolish,” not being ignorant, not being ruled by emotions, but having wisdom and using reason. Earlier, we mentioned the importance of deeply believing in cause and effect. This enables us to discern that "good actions bring good results, and bad actions bring bad results.” We shouldn't just look at the present. Everything we do is like a seed planted in the ground. Sooner or later, “it might not seem to bear fruit now, but the time will come,” and it will definitely blossom and produce fruit.

There was a scholar named Bai Zhizhen who loved animals very much. During a heavy snowstorm in winter, when the birds had nothing to eat, he would sweep away the snow, clear a space, and scatter grain on the ground for them to survive the winter. Later, when bandits invaded their villages, his village was also attacked. Bandits are brutal, and entering a village could mean death for the whole family. But suddenly, tens of thousands of birds gathered in front of his house – an unusual sight. Why did these birds flock there? All living things have a knowing. They could sense the murderous intent of the bandits. Consider this: do animals sense earthquakes before they occur? Yes, they do. Only one kind of animal doesn’t seem to feel anything – why are you all laughing? This laughter shows wisdom, why? It’s because we all know we are the last to know! Many life forms can feel the energy. So, the birds sensed it. During the Tangshan Earthquake, there was a family who was kind to a mouse; they didn’t harm it and even took care of it. In the end, the mouse saved the family. That day, the mouse ran around biting them, annoying them so much that they went outside, saving the whole family. There are many such examples. That's why Master Hongyi (Li Shutong) asked his students to draw *Protecting Life Drawings,* which contained many stories of animals repaying kindness. When children believe from a young age that good deeds bring good results, they will gladly perform good deeds and form the habit.

As a result, so many birds gathered at Bai Zhizhen’s house. The bandits, seeing so many birds, figured the house must be empty, as otherwise there would be no way so many birds would be there. They then went to another house, and this family of over twenty people survived. So, the classics tell us that fearlessness yields health and longevity. By protecting birds and ensuring they are not afraid, we are giving fearlessness. By protecting birds from hunger and cold, we are also giving fearlessness. He received health and longevity and his whole family survived.

Also, there was a woman in Hangzhou who would get angry and kill small animals. She lit a torch and burned ants, killing hundreds and thousands of them. When she saw earthworms, she would pour lime into their holes. When it rained, the water reacted with the lime, causing the temperature to rise and burning the worms to death. Later, she had a child. Of course, she took meticulous care of this child. One day, she left the baby sleeping on the bed and went out. When she returned, she found a black mass on the bed. Looking closer, she saw that it was her baby covered with ants. They had bitten her all over, making her whole body black. These are true stories. Do you think ants, tiny as they are, have no awareness? Yes, they do. It’s just that, “it may not seem to bear fruit now, but the time will come.” So, there is a saying, "A gentleman can wait ten years to seek revenge." "What comes from you will return to you." If you hit someone today, you will be hit back one day. If you scold someone today, you will be scolded in the future. "The way of Heaven always circles back." Those who truly understand this are no longer foolish. Why would they want to hurt others? To hurt others is to hurt oneself. In the end, her child died, and she herself died from grief. So, we must deeply believe in cause and effect.

Next, when we talk about “not being foolish,” it also means correcting our mistakes and not being complacent. Complacency is a waste of ourselves. How can we gain wisdom? We must understand that each moment is precious. We can't buy back time. We can't waste time by not correcting mistakes and improving ourselves. Not cherishing time is foolish. So, cherish time, "manifest your clear virtue, and renew the people." Accomplish yourself and accomplish others – this is wisdom.

Then, we mentioned a third way to test our foolishness: can we make correct decisions in important choices in life? This is very important. As we discussed in the last class, when we initiate something, we must consider the long-term implications. Are there any supporting measures in place? If we organize a lecture, can the local media be involved? Can there be a long-term educational center in the area to support everyone’s studies? Can we set good examples for people to emulate? We shouldn't just initiate something and then not take responsibility. We must think long-term. "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." Promoting culture is not just about having activities and being popular.

Traditional culture is also about the teacher's way, so choosing a teacher and choosing friends is extremely important. In ancient times, choosing friends was done very carefully. "A gentleman avoids casual friendships, choosing his friends as if seeking a teacher.” Before his death, Confucius told his students that after his death, Zixia would progress, while Zigong would regress. This is recorded in *Qun Shu Zhi Yao*. The reason is that Zixia liked to befriend those who had greater virtue than he did, while Zigong liked to associate with those who were inferior to him, and therefore regressed. That is also why Mencius's mother moved three times. The day before yesterday, a couple came from Beijing with their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter to learn about the Hanyuan Academy. I asked them their surname. The mother replied, "My surname is Meng.” A descendant of Mencius! You see, she came all the way from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur by plane, a distance of thousands of kilometers. We are very touched by their sincerity.

So, choosing friends and choosing teachers is crucial. For example, when choosing a teacher, find someone you deeply admire, someone you have complete faith in. This is important. But we must also be calm. Just because we like them doesn't mean we should learn from them. First, the person you admire should also be a good disciple, and he should also have received proper training from his own teacher. This is being calm. This has to do with our entire life of learning and cultivating virtue, so we cannot be careless or impulsive. Does he also have the attitude of a good student? Does he proactively ask for guidance, report his progress, seek instruction, and participate? Specifically, has he implemented *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child)? Implementing *Di Zi Gui* is the attitude of a good student. You might think someone has great eloquence, but eloquence doesn’t necessarily make someone a good teacher. You need to see if they embody “knowing and doing are one.” People today are easily impressed by talent, and they are drawn to talent, but you must still be calm and look at things from the root. A good teacher must first and foremost be a good disciple.

Next, this wisdom also helps us distinguish between good and evil and between right and wrong. It is not easy to distinguish between right and wrong. Most people today chase fame and profit, and they follow the wrong path. Righteousness is the right path. We must always think of the kindness of our parents and our country. This is righteousness. There was a newspaper in a certain country that ran a large article that said, "Desire is the driving force of human progress." It's a disaster when the people in charge of their news agency don’t even know how to differentiate between right and wrong. Many TV shows today promote killing, stealing, lust, and lies, and the government is letting it happen. In ancient times, leaders would use the classics as a standard. So, what was performed all promoted loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness. Even the illiterate understood the principles of being a good person. Nowadays, the line between right and wrong is blurred on TV, and everything is chaotic. When I look back at my own growth, the songs I sang were not positive, uplifting music. They were decadent sounds, and without realizing it, I was being contaminated.

To learn to distinguish between good and evil, I suggest that everyone reads *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. Goodness has true and false forms, straightforward and twisted, right and wrong, hidden and obvious, half and full, big and small, biased and unbiased, easy and difficult. You must carefully learn to differentiate them. Otherwise, if you can’t differentiate good and evil, you are foolish. At the beginning of the book, a group of scholars who had been studying for decades were still unable to differentiate good from evil. They went to ask the Zen Master Zhongfeng. The scholars asked, "The classics say that good deeds will always be rewarded and evil deeds will always be punished. Is this always true?” They had doubts. Hitting and scolding someone is bad, right? Zen Master Zhongfeng said, "Not necessarily." Another person said that showing respect and praising someone is good, right? Zen Master Zhongfeng said, “Not necessarily.” They could not even clearly distinguish good from evil. How could they possibly distinguish good from bad consequences? They could not even differentiate between good causes and good results, so their conclusions would naturally be wrong. So, Zen Master Zhongfeng reminded them, “If we hit or scold someone for their own benefit, then it is good.” They were only looking at the surface. Of course, we cannot superficially interpret this and hit or scold others in the name of good, only to make them resent you for life – that is not wisdom. Respecting and praising others with an ulterior motive is not good, it is flattery. We must see to the core of the matter. Our thoughts and intentions must be pure. “Benefiting others is public, and public is true.” When we are not mixed with selfishness, that is true goodness. “Benefiting oneself is private,” where selfishness is mixed in, “and private is false.” So, we must be able to judge between true and false.

Yesterday, I met a chairman who has done very well in his business, which is wastewater treatment. He didn’t study much; he only finished middle school. I told him he was very lucky. He asked why. I said because he was not bombarded by tests and crammed with knowledge. I ask you all, are the eyes of elementary school students brighter or the eyes of college students? You all know the answer, not me. When a person becomes clearer and brighter, where their soul shines through their eyes, how can it be that the more they study, the more dull their eyes become? We must reflect on our teaching methods. We cannot apply pressure, because in the end, we destroy their capacity for learning and empathy. The whole school system must focus on education in virtue, filial piety, and development of innate wisdom.

His wish was to restore the rivers and waterways to their natural purity. Once that wish arose, he was able to understand many cutting-edge water treatment technologies from around the world. He studied the *I Ching*. Once he calmed his mind, he quickly grasped the concepts. Initially, he was planning to come to Malaysia. He did a divination, and it turned out unfavorable. So, he almost didn’t come. Finally, he had a thought: "Even if this deal doesn't work out, I must bring China's top water treatment technology to Malaysia." Once he made this wish, the deal was done. So, he might be visiting Malaysia frequently in the future. I asked him to speak about *I Ching* and *Qun Shu Zhi Yao*. *I Ching* is the head of all the classics, so it is his responsibility.

Yesterday, during our conversation, he talked about his three criteria for choosing a spouse: First, she must be filial. Second, she must be diligent and capable of working. He said his wife could do the work of three people. Third, she must come from a poor family. He said that because she came from a poor family, she would be able to bear the hardships of his life. He was also looking far ahead. He said that no matter how successful his business became, his goal was not to enjoy wealth, so his wife must be able to live a simple and content life. His business is doing very well now, but he dresses simply and pursues spiritual growth. Both he and his wife study traditional culture with great joy. I’ve met his wife before. I went to Changzhou, where they live, and she is very down-to-earth. These three criteria that he used to choose his spouse can be used as a reference. If you’re already married, then you can use it to help you select daughter-in-laws in the future.

These life experiences can be accumulated. You never know when someone will ask you for advice on choosing a spouse. Like me, I’ve even become a wedding officiant, even though I'm not married! Fortunately, we have studied *Qun Shu Zhi Yao*: “Marriage is to unite two surnames for the good, to honor the ancestors above, and to ensure the continuation of the next generation below. Therefore, a gentleman takes it seriously.” “There should be a distinction between husband and wife, and only then is there love between father and son. And with love between father and son, there is proper conduct between ruler and minister." You see that the core of the five relationships is the husband and wife relationship. When husband and wife uphold love and righteousness, the children will also be loving and righteous. These children grow up to become loyal citizens. The core of the five relationships is husband and wife: “The path of a gentleman begins with the relationship between husband and wife." Whether or not this society can produce gentlemen depends on whether the husband and wife are harmonious. If the husband and wife are constantly fighting, how can children learn to get along with others harmoniously? You can use this passage from the *Book of Rites* when you become a wedding officiant.

As for "not being foolish,” in the examples I have given, it has to do with every aspect of life. Being foolish or not is related to all people and all things. If you judge people incorrectly, you are foolish. If you do things without a plan, you are foolish. Therefore, we must treat all people and all things with wisdom. We should use wisdom to see through the true nature of life and the universe. I have simply offered some perspectives so that you can understand the importance of not being foolish.

Having a long-term vision shows wisdom. What does it mean to have deep insight? Seeing everything from its root cause. As *The Analects* says, “A gentleman focuses on the root. When the root is established, the path arises.” Having a long-term vision means not only looking at the present, and not being shortsighted or greedy for quick results. Having a deep understanding means focusing on the root cause.

I have aimed to capture the spirit of the original while ensuring it reads naturally in English. I have also kept the tone respectful and thoughtful, which is crucial for this particular context. Let me know if you have any questions or want to adjust anything.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**Book Translation:**

We often recall our teachers saying, “A harmonious society begins with a harmonious heart.” This is focusing on the root. To speak frankly, those who focus on the root will never criticize or blame others; those who criticize and blame others will never focus on the root. For example, if we criticize our spouse, we are wrong. Rectifying ourselves and influencing others—"rectifying oneself" is the root, "influencing others" is the branch. If the root is firmly established and absorbs nourishment and water, how can the branches not flourish? So, if your spouse isn't doing well, turn inwards, think, “Ah, I haven't done well enough.” A harmonious family begins with a harmonious heart. First, what should we get rid of? Get rid of the anger and arrogance of blaming others; this is the right way, focusing on the root.

There was a wife who called her husband, and he happened to be busy and was a little impatient with her. She then said, “I’m testing your patience, I’m refining you.” Of course, the husband was impatient and his mind was swayed by the situation, but was there any logic in what the wife said? Firstly, when she said “I’m testing your patience,” she was already demanding something from him. So, if our thoughts are not noticed, we are foolish. "Correct yourself and don't demand from others, then there will be no resentment." If you don't first do well yourself, but demand from others, resentment is inevitable. Confucius said we should understand by analogy, at the very least we need to consider both sides, right? Then, she said she was going to refine him. When a teacher refines a student, it’s because the teacher’s virtue is already accomplished. The teacher knows that refining will bring progress, otherwise, refining will be causing harm and creating bad karma. That isn't true refinement.

So, everyone shouldn't use道理 (moral principles) to hold over other people's heads. We should still do well ourselves first. Why? Only by doing well ourselves can we establish a foundation of trust. Without a foundation of trust, people won't be happy to hear it, why be so demanding? Everything should come about naturally; it's not about demanding things from others. Saying “You must trust me, you must listen to me, I’m doing this for your own good,” already sounds unnatural. That’s all about persuading others.

Today, there are many problems and deficiencies within our group. We must still turn inward and reflect on ourselves. “If virtue is not extensive, people will not come.” Our group has a high turnover rate; “If capacity is not broad, people will not be at peace.” If we lack generosity, people will feel pressured being around us, and they won't be able to stay. We cannot let people leave and then blame them for lacking good roots. That will only make things worse.

Even if a person has capacity and cultivation, and a very good employee still chooses to leave, we absolutely need to reflect on ourselves. Then, we should ask him, "What do you think our team is lacking? Please give us your guidance." This is how we will improve. "Fortune lies in accepting advice." If an employee wants to leave, there must be issues he has noticed. Especially in an organization promoting traditional culture, we should be practicing it ourselves. It should be as warm as a home, so how can it be that people don't want to stay and want to leave? We need to reflect on this. At this point, asking for their opinions, we can make improvements based on what they point out. Otherwise, we are tarnishing the reputation of traditional culture. "Not seeking achievement, but seeking no fault." Acknowledge their contributions these last few years, or the time they’ve spent, for traditional culture and our group, and say “We will strive and work hard to improve these situations. If we improve and get better, we welcome you back.” I believe this way they will not leave with resentment, and they will also have some hope for us. Since we’ve met, it’s meant to be; people should cherish their karmic connections with each other and not create bad karma.

Next, consider the long-term. In the *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, there is a phrase that explains seeing far very well: "Do not focus on the present actions, but focus on the lasting effects; do not focus on the immediate moment, but focus on the long term; do not focus on the self, but focus on the world." I met Uncle Lu eleven years ago, and he was very wise, with great foresight. He noticed that lighters in society had pictures of scantily clad women on them, and understood this sign would affect the social atmosphere. “Of all evils, lewdness is the head.” They were very perceptive.

At the time, in Lujiang, we addressed each other by "Teacher" (老师) - for example, someone with the surname Wang would be called “Teacher Wang.” However, Uncle Lu said that was inappropriate. We explained we used "Teacher" to encourage each other to be a "teacher in learning and a model in conduct." This aspiration is good, but when we use "Teacher," are we able to maintain that attitude without being attached to the title? Because “everyone likes to be a teacher,” if everyone is called Teacher, slowly, it becomes that I am always teaching others, and not others teaching me. If you enjoy being a teacher, will you be able to uphold the value of "teacher in learning and a model in conduct?" It's not easy. Because we observed, when someone called on the phone, for example, a colleague might say, "Hello, I'm Teacher Wang." When someone refers to themselves as "Teacher Wang" it becomes problematic. When we call, we say "Hello, this is Cai Li Xu." Because we don't feel we are worthy of the title "Teacher" yet; we still have far to go. “A teacher is one who transmits the Dao (the Way), imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts.” They saw things very minutely, very long-term, and understood changes in people's hearts. So later we changed it, and called each other “Senior Brother/Sister” (学长).

“Do not focus on the present actions, but focus on the lasting effects; do not focus on the immediate moment, but focus on the long term; do not focus on the self, but focus on the world.” For example, in ancient times, why were women's clothes very conservative? Because they thought of the social atmosphere. Now, people express their individuality, thinking that if they like it, anything is okay. I ask everyone, if a woman is mindful of the social atmosphere of the world when she dresses, does she have merit? Yes, she does. Where does this merit lie? In her mind. Our grandmothers’ generation, you see how dignified they dressed, and people looked at them with reverence. Now, when people dress revealingly, people look down on them. I guarantee, the country with the most revealing clothing, the respect for women will be the lowest, and the rate of harm done to women will be highest. So, only by respecting oneself can one earn the respect of others. Women must respect themselves first.

Where is the respect for women shown? Surely it isn’t shown by revealing clothing or showing off the figure? Isn’t that degrading women and turning them into objects? Women are the root of peace in the world. This is the concept of our Chinese culture, and to say that Chinese people look down on women is nonsense. If those words were spoken by a Chinese person, the negative karma is serious. The title “太太” (Tàitai, meaning “wife”) came from the Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou Dynasty had three great Tais (太) – Tai Jiang, Tai Ren, and Tai Si – mothers who nurtured children who became sages, generation after generation. Women are respected because they are filial to their parents, filial to their in-laws, and support their husbands and educate their children. Because whether the family and the world have a good future rests largely on women.

Who doesn't respect their own mother? But now many children don't have the same respect for their mothers as before. Respect is not something to demand; respect arises naturally out of gratitude for a mother's love for her child. If they don't love their children, how can children feel love and respect for their mothers? What is valued today? Making money is important, but taking care of children is not. The prioritization of righteousness and self-interest is reversed. And when righteousness and self-interest are reversed, it won't be long-term. The *I Ching* reminds us, “Profit is the harmony of righteousness.” This "profit" is not about immediate gain, but a long-lasting benefit, and it is rooted in upholding morality. This "harmony" is that one has upheld one’s morality very well, so one will be able to profit long term.

For example, when a merchant cheats and doesn't have a sense of righteousness, can his profit be long-term? Soon a prodigal son will come and squander the wealth. It is ill-gotten wealth, and so it will certainly be lost. When a couple only earns money and doesn’t educate their children, prodigal children will come and waste it. I’ve mentioned before that a couple in Zhuzhou, Hunan, opened a factory but didn’t teach their child well. Their child gambled on soccer, lost everything, and in the end the parents committed suicide, and the child exhausted all his blessings. So, the words of the ancients in the *I Ching* are worthy of our deep reflection. Profit must come from upholding righteousness. Which industry does not uphold righteousness? Any profession in life is about serving others and complying with righteousness.

The *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* brings up the story of Zigong and Zilu to illustrate this point. Zigong was in another country, and he redeemed some people of his home state of Lu who had been enslaved. According to the regulations of the state, the state would reimburse him for the ransom, but he refused it, thinking himself very noble. Confucius rebuked him. One day, Zilu saw someone drowning and, without regard for his own safety, jumped in to save him. The person was grateful and gave Zilu an ox. Zilu accepted it, and Confucius praised him.

Accepting an ox from someone, people might say, "You should not receive any gains when you’ve given your effort.” When Zigong redeemed people but did not take the reimbursement, people might think him noble. Confucius' perspective wasn’t like this. He saw far into the future. If Zigong doesn't accept the money, anyone wanting to redeem others in the future will think twice, saying to himself, “Ah, if I take money for the rescue, I won’t be as noble as Zigong. Will people laugh at me?” Because of that hesitation, there might be a missed chance to save someone. If a person is not saved, that person might be the head of the family, and the entire family may be dependent on that person. Therefore one person is lost, a whole family is lost. But if Zigong takes the reimbursement money, these anxieties and worries will disappear, and people will not hesitate. Zilu risked his life to save a person and accepted an ox in return; the message would then be spread that "Good deeds bring good rewards, we should help more people." This is how you build good societal values. We cannot just look at what’s happening at that moment, or at the surface level; we need to look far into the future.

Master Shen also looked far into the future. I am very lucky to have had the opportunity to spend time with him. For example, he expected of us that "teaching is the least 'monetarily' promising career, but it is the most important because the transmission of culture depends on the way of the teacher." He was so far-sighted! Once, when we were talking with him, someone said "this traditional Chinese character..." Master Shen looked at him and said, "They are orthodox characters. Orthodox characters are not complex at all." Notice that people have a subconscious; “traditional characters,” “traditional characters,” “traditional characters”... what feeling does that bring in one’s heart? “Orthodox characters,” “orthodox characters,” what feeling does that bring? They are legitimate, in the legitimate lies the wisdom of life. Look at the character "righteousness" (义, *yi*). How is it written? The top part is 羊, *yang*, which means sheep, or auspicious, and beautiful. So, making myself more and more perfect is called "righteousness." This is the correct perspective on life. Just eating well and dressing well is not making ourselves more and more beautiful, or making our spirits higher. It is letting ourselves fall more and more. So, everyone should pay attention to what Master Shen said. We need to change how we say things, or we may incur wrongdoing. If we make people think something is “complex” (繁, *fan*), they won’t want to learn it. If they see it as “orthodox” (正, *zheng*), they will want to recognize their roots, and identify with the true and authentic.

I remember when I read Western translated books, I felt that we were losing our national confidence, even when I was at university, a teacher’s college, most of what we read were translated books. The Chinese nation is the most knowledgeable in the world about education, with 5,000 years of ideas, 5,000 years of experience, 5,000 years of methods, 5,000 years of wisdom, and 5,000 years of results, why were we reading other people's ideas in teacher's college? We have lost our national confidence.

There is a translated phrase, "People-oriented." Have you seen that phrase before? I ask everyone, when you see that phrase, whom do you first think of with that "people?" Yourself. Then that is problematic; focusing on yourself is selfishness. So, with these Western translations, we need to be careful. Western utilitarian societies are self-centered. However, in China, there is a saying: "The heart of a filial son has only his parents, not himself.” “Yang Xiang kills a tiger”: when her father was being bitten by a tiger and near death, a young girl rushed forward and grabbed the tiger. If she had thought of herself, she would be fearful, and wouldn't be able to save her father. It wasn't just with fathers; look at the brothers in the Han dynasty, Zhao Xiao and Zhao Li. They were willing to die for their brothers, putting themselves in danger. People who think of themselves first cannot do such things, cannot perform such acts of virtue.

So, this “people” in “people-oriented,” if we use the perspective of our habits to approach it, it will become selfish. But if we use our true nature to view it, that person will restore their shining virtue. Then they will have grasped the root. The most important value in this life is to elevate our virtue and our humanity. This is the true meaning of life, not chasing fame and fortune, or letting our spirits fall. Alright, we value virtue, and want to restore shining virtue, then what is the root of virtue? The root of humanity lies in virtue, and the root of virtue lies in filial piety. You see, all of them are going towards the root. So, the teachers say during lectures, "Our Chinese nation takes filial piety as the root,” it is a wise statement. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid that people will misunderstand this statement, and use it selfishly. So we must pull them back, and say that virtue is the root, filial piety is the root. “Filial piety, is the root of virtue.”

Fifthly, what is not being foolish? It is not forgetting the root, knowing, feeling, and repaying gratitude. To not know, feel, and repay gratitude is to be ungrateful. But in this time, nobody reminds you, and unknowingly, we follow the flow of material desires. “Desires cause our wisdom to be lost, and profit causes our wisdom to be clouded." A one or two year old child doesn’t yet have vanity. I heard a story from a friend. She said there was a young, unmarried woman, who was quite young and pretty, who visited her friend’s house. Her friend had a child, and was also older than her. She asked the child (who was two or three years old), "Is your mother more beautiful, or is Auntie more beautiful?" This auntie did not have wisdom. She had asked a nonsensical question. Many people don't have wisdom and are deeply attached to emotions. If you are a grandparent, you cannot ask your grandchildren, “Does Grandpa love you more, or does Grandfather love you more?” You are forcing them to discriminate, and creating attachments. So sometimes people don’t educate themselves, and if they can’t educate themselves, I don’t believe they can educate others well. You have to guide them, see the kindness of their grandfather, and not have the grandfather try to compete with the other grandfather, and have the grandmother try to compete with the other grandmother. This is also foolish. As a result, when that child was asked that question, without even thinking, the child said “My mother is more beautiful.” The auntie was a little hurt, she brought shame on herself. How can you ask a child something that would destroy their natural goodness?

But if you calmly observe, in middle school and high school, they will start saying things like “Mom, look at other mothers, they wear designer brands. Look at the makeup that other mothers use.” They start to complain, so people easily become affected. “Desires cause our wisdom to be lost, and profit causes our wisdom to be clouded.” Slowly, they’ll say things like "Dad, why don't you earn more money?" "Dad, the cars that other people drive are much bigger." Then they’re ruined. So, there’s a saying, “A child doesn’t dislike their mother’s ugliness, and a dog doesn't dislike the poverty of its home.” This maintains their kind nature.

Speaking of this, I am very ashamed. When I was in and around university, I started doing business. When I returned home, I just “dipped in soy sauce,” to use a Fujianese saying. I would just go home, put my luggage down, and then disappear. I would go find friends, and busied myself with my career. I didn’t sit down and properly talk with my parents and sisters to reassure them. I didn’t do any of these things. So, without knowing, we fall. Have you all seen how I looked seven or eight years ago when I wore suits? I looked like I was full of material desire. Those habits were still there, and hadn’t yet been completely washed away. Are they there now? Don’t ask others, ask yourselves. Look at your reflection to see if your clothes are neat, look at your heart to see what’s fortunate or unfortunate. Examining your own heart is the right way.

Sixth, not being foolish is understanding human relationships and the logic of situations. In *Dream of the Red Chamber*, there is a quote. I’m not telling everyone to read *Dream of the Red Chamber*. I say this one quote is very good and still relevant. There are many crying scenes in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, so it’s better to read the *Four Books and Five Classics*. But this phrase is very insightful: "Being well-versed in the affairs of the world is all knowledge; being skilled in human relationships is all literature." Human relationships and situations: do you use wisdom to approach them, or do you use your likes and dislikes and emotions to deal with them? The results will be completely different.

Confucius said, "For things that are already done, do not dwell on them; for things that are already decided, do not try to change them; for things that have already happened, do not blame them." There is the wisdom of human relationships within these statements. If something has already happened and is irreversible, then consider how to make amends. It’s like fixing the pen after the sheep is lost. Don't keep complaining about it, as it may make the involved person feel humiliated, or others may also feel very uncomfortable. Take it as a valuable lesson, and learn from it. Don't keep complaining, and using the situation to your own advantage. That’s not good. Raking up old issues is not reasonable. “For things that are already decided, do not try to change them." This "decided" means his mind is already set. You can remind them, but do not try to persuade them forcefully. For example, you know that a relative or friend is wrong, you might say "I'm telling you, if you do this, you’ll definitely be in a bad situation." Should you say that? This is forceful persuasion. But if their minds are already set, and you tell them so definitely, saying that they will be in a bad situation, if things really go bad, they won’t come back to you. Why? Because they can’t let go of their pride and can’t save face.

So, you have to know how to leave a way out for the other person. Parents, leaders, and teachers need to understand this. Otherwise, many parents today easily say things like: “How dare you! I will disown you!” But, your child may be determined to do it anyway. Because today’s youth have not read ancient books since they were young, their ability to accept advice from parents or others is limited. So, today’s youth, and those in the future, have not grown up with a tradition of reading ancient books since childhood. They may only begin studying it as adults. You need to slowly help them to subdue their arrogance and pride. They cannot accept it all at once. Often, what is needed is to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. You need to fall down, get bruised, and then they come back. “Mom…” “Come, come here,” hurry and “put some medicine on.” Don’t scold them. After putting the medicine on, “Have you missed mom’s cooking?” Quickly cook something delicious, and let them sleep well. “It’s good that you’re back, it’s good that you’re back, everything’s alright.” Pat them on the shoulder and show them warmth. Once they have calmed down and are willing to listen to you, the opportunity will come. But if you say, “Get out and don’t come back,” then it’s all over, and things can go much worse. Why is my heart beating faster as I say this? I am not composed enough. Acting needs to be... the acting is fake, but the heart cannot move. When the heart is not moved, it’s truly acting. If the heart moves, you're just acting with your emotions.

So, these sayings of the ancients, when you understand them through life’s experience, they have great depth. Our teacher knew that the U.S. was wrong to attack Iraq. What did the teacher do? Remind, and not try to strongly persuade or advise. The teacher wrote a letter, and made two seals – “Angel of Peace,” and “God Loves the World.” The seals were gifted to President Bush with the letter, showing great respect and sincerity. As a result, the war happened, and it was difficult to handle. A few years later, the teacher invited President Bush to meet again. By this time, he felt that the teacher’s advice at that time was right. So later, during that meeting, the teacher told him that education for young people and ethics and morals are very important, and he listened. He then adjusted his policies and started to prioritize moral education. So, in life, you need to be astute in interactions and situations, and not create bad karma with people.

The teacher has also said: “Before the age of 20, you can advise. Between 20 and 40, you need to use hints. After 40, then do not advise at all.” Everyone is smiling so happily; does this mean we're all over 40? There is life experience in this, but more importantly it is a reminder to us, to always "be happy to hear about our wrongdoings." When others advise us, we should happily accept, then "upright and sincere people, will gradually become close to you."


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided text from Chinese to English, keeping in mind nuances and aiming for clarity:

**Title:** On Self-Awareness, Leadership, and Cultivating Virtue

**Translation:**

In reality, it's difficult for people to accurately assess their own level; they often overestimate themselves. For example, someone might say, "I do listen to advice; when people advise me, I don't ignore it." Just hearing these few words makes it clear that it's best not to advise them. When you do offer advice, they immediately start explaining themselves. As a result, others will be less inclined to offer counsel in the future, right? It's as if they make you feel like you’re the one in the wrong, so they'll stop speaking. Eventually, if they hear something from you they don’t like, the next time they see you, they'll avoid you. They don’t want to risk creating a conflict. We need to learn from Emperor Taizong of Tang; he was pleased even when given incorrect advice. This is invaluable.

"Let bygones be bygones." Once something is in the past, whether in a family, a society, or a nation, across generations globally, we face a problem: a lack of moral and ethical education. We see corruption in politics, in various industries, and the relentless pursuit of fame and profit. This is no longer a rare occurrence; it's a reality. Therefore, classical texts tell us, "When there are no teachers, there's no reason for blame." Simply punishing or reprimanding people may not solve the problem. Severely punishing someone might lead them to desperate measures. Hence, Confucius said in the *Analects*, “To kill without teaching is cruel.” To punish or kill someone without educating them first is to become harsh and tyrannical.

So what should be done? When you are in a group, to be frank, everyone is just starting on their path of cultivation. If you try to discuss every single detail of daily life, it would take days, even weeks, because everyone has their own perspective and believes they are right. So, when dealing with interpersonal issues, don't get bogged down in the trivial. Instead, start with the leadership and adopt a "let bygones be bygones" approach. Everyone is together for a reason, like a family. From today onwards, let us put aside past grievances. Let's be frank with each other and communicate directly, rather than whispering behind each other’s backs. This change in the atmosphere will gradually come about with everyone's resolve and attitude. In a family, if people are afraid to speak to their spouse or family members, and instead go to outsiders, how painful is that? To be honest, going to outsiders makes you a laughingstock; “one should not air the family’s dirty laundry.” This applies to a family as well as a group. Therefore, when we have this attitude, we can communicate honestly, and those who offer advice and reminders can do so calmly. Why? Because our goal is not to use the situation as an excuse, or to settle old scores. It's for the other person’s well-being. When we are constantly thinking about them, we are calm, and our words are gentle, which allows the other person to feel that you're genuinely concerned for them.

In truth, when we share principles with others, we need to examine our own hearts. What state is our heart in? Are we trying to teach them a lesson, argue who’s right or wrong, or are we trying to help them succeed? If our intention is wrong, then even if the principles we share are correct, they’re useless. Because what the other person first senses is our heart. If our heart is truly and constantly thinking of them, even if our eloquence isn't great, they will be moved. So, the speaker is calm, and the listener is happy to accept. Where do we begin? With ourselves. See, we're back to the fundamental. Any positive trend we wish to initiate, we can’t say, "Oh, let *them* do it." That would be wrong. We must start with ourselves.

Seventh, we must be non-deluded (or wise), valuing substance over form. In learning traditional culture, the amount of classics you've heard or scriptures you've read is not the measure of your progress; that’s just the method. These methods are more importantly for what? To allow oneself to understand principles and to let go of habits. Letting go is the real, substantive practice. We cannot practice superficially, because that leads to clinging. We’ll think, “Others say I'm diligent, others say I’ve learned well.” That practice then becomes subject to the “eight winds” of praise and criticism.

Those who value substance start with the basics. Again, we are talking about the root. What are the basics? Letting go of the idea of opposing anyone. If you still can’t stand someone, your basics have already been broken. You might as well stop talking about the other practices. If you bow a hundred times or a thousand times daily, it’s all just superficial. You might have a hundred scriptures memorized, but it's all useless if you can't move people. If you're constantly in opposition to them, how can you move them? Everywhere you go, you cause chaos. The time is not as important as the place, and the place is not as important as the people. If you cannot let go of opposition, you cannot achieve anything. "All things are one, this is called *Ren* (benevolence),” as stated in *Geyan Bielu*. If we’re one, how can there be opposition? I’m the left hand; you're the right. If my left hand is injured, what will the right hand do? Will it say, "Oh, you're the left hand, so it’s your problem, it has nothing to do with me"? Not only that, and not just being indifferent, will it say, “Alright, I’ll make a deal with you. I’ll help you apply medicine if you give me one hundred ringgit (Malaysian currency)?" The desire for personal gain shows we're not one. We are divided. Therefore, letting go, and not differentiating “you” from “I,” eliminates opposition. We're one body, one family. Where can opposition be found?

Secondly, we must let go of the desire to control. Don't make demands, don't criticize, and don't insist that others do things your way. That's being overbearing. Others are the protagonists of their own lives; we are supporting characters. Try our best to assist them. If they listen, that's wonderful; if they don't, don't worry about it, this is letting go of control. What we have the greatest control over is our own heart and our own spiritual cultivation. If we are neglecting our own self-cultivation and only focusing on controlling others, they will eventually tell us, “You're just as bad as I am. Mind your own business.” Improving ourselves is paramount; it’s not about controlling or making demands on others.

Thirdly, we must let go of the desire to possess. Children have a connection with us because of karma; we can't control them. The more we control them, the less happy they will be, and they will avoid us. The less connection you’ll have with them. You do as much as you have the capacity for, and once you have done your best, don’t worry about it. Otherwise, emotions and attachments will be obstacles, preventing you from achieving purity. We must learn to be like a mirror: "When the reflection comes, it doesn’t reject it.” When someone stands before a mirror, it reflects them clearly, with sincerity and compassion; “when the reflection leaves, it does not cling to it.” When the person leaves, the mirror remains clear and untainted, free from attachment and prejudice.

Alright, that concludes our discussion on the seventh point: valuing substance over form. Our discussion on being "non-deluded" ends here. Thank you all!

**Lecture 17: The Importance of Self-Education: Part 3 - Being Strict with Oneself and Lenient with Others**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

When cultivating ourselves, the fourth mental effort is to overcome arrogance. From the very beginning of the *Book of Rites*, in the chapter on “Ceremonial Observances,” it is stated, “One must be respectful,” implying that we should show respect to all people and things, thus making it impossible to be arrogant. In the sixty-four hexagrams of the *I Ching* (Book of Changes), only one hexagram has all six lines auspicious, which is the hexagram of humility. Humility is the antidote to arrogance. What are some manifestations of arrogance? For instance, looking down on others is arrogance. Another example is only respecting those you admire, which is also arrogance. Is it that those you don’t admire don't deserve respect? Isn't that still using a superior/inferior mindset to view others? Those who study the teachings of sages should see the inherent nature of people, and not have prejudices against them. Having prejudices against others is also arrogance. "That’s just their habit," some might say. However, habits can be changed and abandoned. Everyone has the “inherent awareness,” inherently possesses bright virtue and is originally good. Everyone is capable of returning to that state. Therefore, we should treat everyone as if they were a sage, showing them the same respect. Wouldn't this attitude give them confidence?

When we respect others, we are frankly respecting ourselves. Respecting others aligns with our inherent virtuous nature. Disrespecting others is indulging arrogance, which is not loving ourselves, but rather debasing ourselves. We must treat everyone equally with respect. We shouldn’t say, "I only respect those I admire." Please tell me, is there such a statement in the classics? If not, then one is not acting according to the classics, which is arrogance. To follow one's own desires rather than the teachings of the sages is arrogance. One’s personal opinions are too strong. Therefore, following the teachings of sages and classics, rather than indulging our afflictions and habits, and refraining from following our own thoughts and views is the first step in studying the teachings of sages. Confucius "transmitted but did not create." Everything he talked about came from the classics; he did not express his own views or make up his own doctrines. He first demanded these standards of himself, using the classics to examine himself.

Being overly critical is a sign of arrogance. Being dogmatic, making immediate judgments upon seeing something – "It must be like this" – very often leads to wrong conclusions. When this becomes a habit, one becomes increasingly arrogant. Dogmatism and criticism are harmful, causing too much damage to both ourselves and others. There is a saying: "Those rich in virtue are peaceful in their hearts.” This can also be used to examine our cultivation. "Those who see good in everyone will have more words of approval. Those with little virtue are critical and arrogant; they find people repulsive, and so they scorn and reject others.” “Observe virtue through forbearance, and observe blessings through generosity.” Those of great virtue have great tolerance. “Their hearts are peaceful.” They are inclusive and trusting. "They see the good in everyone,” always looking for people's merits, "and have more words of approval." Frankly speaking, “they see the good qualities in everyone.” This also takes practice. "I understand this principle and want to see people’s strengths, but it seems I can't." That's because you are used to seeing people's shortcomings. Through training, by writing down every day who’s good qualities you’ve seen, the ability to appreciate the good qualities in others will gradually become a habit. “Those with little virtue are critical and arrogant; they find people repulsive.” They are always criticizing, looking down on others, and holding grudges. “They scorn and reject others.” This lack of virtue is expressed through their arrogance. Frequently arguing about right and wrong is also a form of arrogance. Being fond of acting as a teacher, continuing to talk even when others won't listen, this too is arrogance.

Why do we become arrogant? Of course, there are many reasons. We just covered the chapter on “Tolerance” in the *Essentials of Governing from Ancient Books* course, which explored arrogance in detail. Here, I will mention a few common mental states. The “perception of high and low” gives rise to arrogance: “I am superior, and others are inferior.” If we truly take the teachings of sages to heart, then we can subdue arrogance. As the *Standards for Being a Student* states, “Sages and virtuous ones can be attained through diligent cultivation.” Everyone can become a sage. So, what is there to be arrogant about? *The Standards for Being a Student* says, “All human beings deserve our love.” If we don't treat others with kindness, then we haven’t truly implemented the teachings. What is there to be arrogant about? "Treat your elders as if they were your father, and treat your older brothers as if they were your own brothers." “Do not flatter the wealthy or be arrogant toward the poor.” It's not good to be arrogant just because someone is not wealthy or lacks a certain level of education.

People easily become arrogant when their external conditions are better than others, or they feel their knowledge and morality are superior to others. Frankly speaking, arrogance is a sign that one lacks both learning and virtue. There is a saying, “Scholars often look down on each other.” But this statement already gives scholars a great deal of credit, right? Those who look down on others have not truly internalized the teachings. The principle of "One must be respectful" has not been implemented, which makes them readers of books in name only, and they will suffer a loss of blessings. So, if we tell others that "I am learning traditional culture," we are putting ourselves in the public eye. Thus, we cannot be arrogant. If we become arrogant, we will lose our blessings due to the gap between our claims and our actual behavior. "Reputation is also a blessing." If we have the reputation but don’t live up to it, our blessings will be squandered. Therefore, I need to subdue my arrogance quickly, or because I have a reputation without real substance, I might stop growing. I need to practice diligently, and my virtue must catch up.

This “perception of high and low” can even extend to things such as having black, shiny hair. Why else would girls keep trying to show it off? The place where those learning sage teachings reside should be a place that brings joy to others. If you have thick, shiny black hair, and you encounter me, with my several strands of white hair, wouldn’t I feel inferior? Even height, education, or having double eyelids can become a source of arrogance, right? In this kind of competitive society, if you can avoid arrogance, you are no ordinary person. Only through constant self-reflection will we be able to gradually remove arrogance. "Originally, there is nothing; where can the dust settle?" We came into this world pure and clean. Why acquire so many bad habits? It's unfair to ourselves. We must carefully observe our own minds and let these things go.

There is also a type of arrogance called self-deprecation. For example, someone might have grown up poor and been mocked by others, creating psychological barriers. After graduating from university, they frantically try to make money. After making money, they buy big houses and expensive cars to show off to others, thinking that this will soothe their inner regrets. This is a mistake. Why? No matter how big their house is, someone else will always have a bigger one. Then wouldn't they become miserable again? No matter how nice their car is, someone else will always have a better one. So, if we are pursuing these external possessions in order to satisfy our vanity or to mask our feelings of inferiority, and we then try to make a lot of money and gain a lot of knowledge to obtain those outward things, our life will be exhausted. Comparing ourselves with others will only cause great frustration. A person's nobility doesn't come from external conditions, but from their actions! Many national leaders are cursed and criticized by their people. What is so noble about that? We find that pathetic. Why? Because they have let themselves and their people down. Look at Madam Hsu Che. What kind of social status did she have? Yes, she was not a department head or manager. She didn’t have any of those positions, but why is she considered a national treasure? It is because she is selfless. She is noble because of her actions. Our actions should align with the classics, that's what makes us noble, not trying to compare ourselves to others and trying to bring others down. That entire direction and goal are incorrect.

How do we counteract these arrogant attitudes? First, compare yourself to the sages, and arrogance will become less likely. "When your virtue is compared to those above you, you will know shame." There won't be enough time for remorse and shame, so how could we be arrogant? If arrogance arises in us, we should create a visualization: "Confucius, Mencius, all the sages and ancestors, you must have all seen my arrogance. I am so ashamed. How could I, who claim to pursue sagehood and virtuousness, give in to my own arrogance?” This will bring forth a sense of shame.

In the past few days, our fellow students in the study group had a course on “Relating the Virtues of Ancestors.” In that course, they shared their parents' kindness, their parents’ virtues, and the virtues of their ancestors. They also confessed their past filial transgressions and mistakes. Many students mentioned that their ancestors are truly by our side. One of our students had never met his grandfather when he was born. However, his grandfather appeared in his dreams several times, and he thought that he was an immortal because of his long beard. He told his grandmother, "There is an old man with a long white beard; I met an immortal!" His grandmother told him, "That is your grandfather."

As Confucius said in *Doctrine of the Mean*, "When offering sacrifices, it is as if they are above you and as if they are by your side." Sages understand the true nature of the universe and of life. The physical body will decay, but the spirit will not. Therefore, our ancestors, many of whom were virtuous, are often in higher realms and can see us. Their spirits are ascending. The *Three Character Classic* proves this, "Dou Yanshan had the proper method," which is to say that he was enlightened by his own grandfather. Then, he changed his behavior for the better; otherwise, his blessings would have been exhausted, and he would not have lived. Therefore, one must believe in truth, and believe in one's ancestors. Do not doubt the truth or your ancestors, or this doubt will cause a great loss of blessing.

I have shared before an example about a lady from Xinjiang. Her boss, who was learning about traditional culture, was very generous, and had printed many books and DVDs. She had a little greed and always took a lot of them, but she never read them. Instead, she put them under her bed. Suddenly, one day, her daughter said, "Mom, I dreamt about grandpa." That is, her father-in-law, "Grandpa said," her three year-old daughter said, "Quickly take out the books under your bed and read them, especially *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*.” She was shocked because her daughter did not know that there were books under her bed. The ancestors are always protecting us. At that time, she was contemplating divorcing her husband, so her father-in-law came to her. After that, she became more earnest in her studies.

We Chinese people are very clear that there are ancestors and deities in heaven and earth. You can still see in rural areas that people worship heaven, earth, the local earth gods, the kitchen god (who records good and bad deeds), and their ancestors. When people have this kind of respect, they will stop doing bad deeds and cultivate good ones; they will not dare to be unrestrained. This is a very precious culture.

Therefore, firstly, compare ourselves to the sages. Our teacher taught us, “When learning Confucianism, learn from Confucius.” Start today. Don't compare yourself to Zhang San or Li Si; compare yourself to Confucius. This will definitely eliminate arrogance because we are far behind. We must hurry to "look up and feel that it is higher; drill into it and feel that it is harder." We are always feeling like we cannot catch up to the master, and the difference is too great. Thus, we must be brave, diligent, and catch up. Therefore, this piece of wisdom from our teacher is very beneficial. “When learning the Dao, learn from Laozi.” Take Laozi’s *Tao Te Ching* as your standard. “When learning Buddhism, learn from Sakyamuni Buddha.” Take these three sage teachers as models. For example, if we are engaged in education, Sakyamuni Buddha taught for eight hours a day for forty-nine years. We can strive toward this goal. How will we have time for arrogance?

Secondly, arrogance can easily manifest itself in the process of learning the teachings of sages. After hearing a lot, we may use the teachings to look at others and demand things of others. This can also easily lead to arrogance. So, whether we are reading classics or listening to lectures, we need to have the right attitude. We are the primary audience; we are the ones to whom the teachings are being taught. Even if we are sharing courses with others, giving lectures to students, it is primarily to encourage ourselves. And after encouraging everyone, we must remind ourselves, "I spoke these principles and everyone heard them. If I don't practice them, people will laugh at me, and people will lose confidence in the teachings of the sages." Then, we will become more cautious, and it will be impossible to be arrogant. We must have the mindset that we are the only student and everyone else is a teacher. With the mindset that everyone else is a teacher, we cannot become arrogant. These mindsets counteract arrogance.

This is indeed the way Confucius taught, and we must know how to apply this. Confucius said, "When walking among three people, there must be one who is my teacher. Choose his good and follow it," so his good qualities are our teachers. "Choose his shortcomings and correct them," so his shortcomings are also our teachers. Different people, whether good or bad, are our teachers. The same person has both good and bad qualities. Their good qualities are our teachers, and their bad qualities are also our teachers. For example, if a person has a bad temper, then he is reminding us not to be like him. Is he not teaching us in that way? And if we see that a person has a bad temper and we continually urge ourselves not to lose our temper, I can guarantee that when you completely subdue your temper, if he is your colleague or family member, he will definitely be moved because he will see that you have been changing. People all have a sense of conscience. Even a very unfilial person will get angry if you call them unfilial. However, if you say they are filial, they will be happy. They all have that sense of conscience.

So we must transform. If we don't transform this mindset, we will be in opposition to others. If he is arrogant, and you see his arrogance, then your displeasure will cause you to become arrogant. "If there is a Buddha in your heart, you will see a Buddha in others; if there is dung in your heart, you will see dung in others.” This story of Su Dongpo is very inspiring. "This person’s temper is really bad!" Our temper is also manifesting. How can we criticize others when we are the same? Those who are "skilled at judging others" are arrogant. "By observing others, one neglects oneself." We are not diligent in examining ourselves, and we even make excuses for ourselves.

Confucius educated his student, Zigong, who was very eloquent and wealthy. Frankly speaking, he could have easily become arrogant. Seeing his student criticizing others, Confucius seized the opportunity: "Ci, are you so virtuous? I'm putting all my effort into my self-cultivation, and I still feel that I don't have enough time. Yet you are still criticizing others!" This timing was very wise.

Therefore, in the future, when we see other people's mistakes, we must not get upset. First, we can say to ourselves, "Good. He has this flaw; I will completely correct it. In this way I will move him, and I will not let down the revelation he has given me." How good that is! "The benevolent have no enemies." We will not be in opposition or conflict with others. This is truly putting *Standards for Being a Student* into practice: "When you see good in others, immediately think to emulate them," and "when you see bad in others, reflect within yourself" to correct it. Therefore, we admire Uncle Lu very much. He said that he wants to be an expert in correcting mistakes. I remember that all along, my elders, who were my fathers and were wise and virtuous, often asked us, “What shortcomings do you see in me? Please point them out so that I can correct them." They were so humble and open to being taught.

Let us reflect on this. How long has it been since we asked our partner, "Do you see any shortcomings in me? Can you help me?" Before asking this question, one should go to a coffee shop to show sincerity. Or, if we are in a leadership position, how long has it been since we asked our subordinates, "Are there any things that I have done improperly?" That’s how a leader should act—open to being advised. If it’s been a long time, it means that our humility and teachable attitude are still lacking.

We must understand that the study of traditional culture is a practical study, a study of the gentleman. In Xunzi’s chapter on "Encouraging Learning," it is said that "the gentleman's learning, enters through the ear," we listen and take it in, "and stays in the heart." This quote reminds us not to learn incorrectly. We must internalize the teachings in our hearts, constantly reflecting on the teachings. When we actually do it, it “extends to the four limbs, and manifests in one’s movements and stillness.” What’s in the heart becomes evident in one’s actions. "Sincerity within manifests without." You see that his words are gentle, and he is very sensitive to the needs of others, taking the initiative to help. Sometimes, when we look at someone who is very enthusiastic in helping others, we feel embarrassed sitting next to them. "How is it that he can see so many needs while I'm slow to notice?" That's because they have “extended it to the four limbs and manifested in their movements and stillness.” A person with self-cultivation not only makes people feel like they are being bathed in a spring breeze through their words and actions, but even without saying a word, they give off a very good feeling and have a good field. Our teacher said that his teacher, Zhangjia Master, said that being by his side, even without a word, made one feel comfortable in body and mind. In scientific terms, we would say that it is because his magnetic field is very good. This is how one "manifests in their movements and stillness.”

However, with the learning of a small person, “it enters through the ear,” it doesn’t even enter the heart, and without first cultivating oneself, “it comes out of the mouth.” Maybe they’ll be fond of teaching others, criticizing and blaming them. The distance between the mouth and ears is only four inches, how could that ever be enough to cultivate one's seven-foot body? The heart is the master. Therefore, these teachings must first enter the heart, and we must sincerely put them into practice. Otherwise, it will become merely “a knowledge that is memorized and asked about,” or just showing off with words. Showing off with words will become defaming the teachings of sages. People will say, “Those who learn just talk, they don't act." Then we will be at fault. So, our attitude toward learning must be that it “enters through the ear and stays in the heart.” Learn one teaching, and practice it sincerely. “Extend it to the four limbs.”

Now, let’s talk specifically about how to deal with criticism. Criticism is a sign of arrogance. One of our fellow students said that his father taught him, "You should not criticize a person until you have known them for three years." This teaching is very wise! If you haven’t known a person for three years, how would you know what they are thinking? Judging a person or criticizing them just by one action is surely a mistake. That action could very well have been intended as something good, but we might still think it was wrong. Therefore, this family rule is very good. I happened to hear it, so I will also follow this example. That is, the teaching of his father has resonated with me. We can also teach this to children, who will then carefully observe and learn the strengths of others, without making rash judgments.

Furthermore, criticism is not good for oneself. A person who is fond of criticizing will have their arrogance grow constantly, and they will degenerate. Secondly, if one has experienced many team efforts in life, one will understand how difficult it is to accomplish things nowadays. Why? Because people have lost their standards of good and evil, right and wrong. If we haven’t studied the classics since we were young, it will be relatively difficult to establish common ground. Furthermore, people’s blessings are relatively shallow. Without sufficient blessings, when we try to accomplish things, many conditions will not be met. So, given these kinds of analyses, we can see how difficult it already is to accomplish one good thing. How can we continue to criticize others? Won't that damage the confidence and the initiative of those who are making an effort? Yes, it will. Therefore, those who have a broader perspective, who can see how difficult it is to accomplish things these days, will not criticize haphazardly. Even if there is a deficiency, one should first acknowledge the other person privately, then gently say, "It would be even better if…" If the other person receives your acknowledgement, they will be even more motivated, and they will gladly accept your suggestion; that is the right way.

Otherwise, since it is already so difficult to accomplish things, if you have not even affirmed them but are just criticizing them, how disheartened will that person be? You might say, "He really didn't do a good job!" Have you tried to understand that they only had a week to do this, not two months? So, the habit of criticizing must be changed. Otherwise, the mouth will create a great deal of bad karma. When people make immediate judgments, please ask yourself, have you understood all the objective conditions? Thus, people are not calm enough and allow themselves to be led around by their habits. If you have objectively understood all the factors, then I guarantee you will not criticize. Why? Because your motivation is for the good of the other person, for the good of the entire group. So how can you be critical? You will be skillful. You will affirm what needs to be affirmed, encourage what needs to be encouraged, and remind what needs to be reminded.

Criticism is contagious: "It takes years to learn goodness, but only a day to learn badness." If a child or a young person hears an adult say a few critical things, they will learn it. But, to have them learn goodness, even after following you for three years, they might still not learn it. Once we recognize this, in front of our children, our subordinates, or young people, we must never set a wrong example. Otherwise, we are not qualified to be a leader or an elder. You will have led them astray.

Therefore, to teach our children, we must first teach ourselves. How easy is it to be a parent? How easy is it to be a teacher or leader? We might have a title, but what is the reality? The reality is reason, and thinking of others at every moment, not just satisfying the desire to speak. Those who are emotional are not qualified to be a leader or teacher. It is just that we have the fortune to be in that position, so we must be even more cautious. We must live up to our title. Thus, we must learn to be a leader, a parent, and a teacher. Our ancestors have given us this blessing, allowing me to be a teacher, and allowing students, parents, and the nation to trust me. We must be worthy of that trust. If we do that, we will be cautious, and we won’t let ourselves be unrestrained.

I hope this translation is helpful! Let me know if you have any other text that needs translation.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for a professional and natural English style suitable for a book:

**Title:  "We Are Called Teachers, Yet Set Wrong Examples - How Can We Bear This?"**

"We are called teachers, yet we ourselves set wrong examples – how can we bear this? In our recent analysis, we criticized others, but we ourselves are falling into degradation, and this strikes a blow to those who are making an effort. Furthermore, when you criticize, those who hear it form prejudices against the person being criticized. Doesn't this sow discord within the group? To be truly honest, who can listen to criticism without leaving a mark on their heart? If someone says, “I hear it and it’s gone, I won’t dwell on it,” I admire their skill. It’s not easy. But doesn't that initial impression create prejudice? When elders and teachers hear criticism, they immediately say, 'Alright, don't say any more. I will remember their kindness for the rest of my life.' That’s wisdom! When someone says, 'Do you know what he said about you?' and the response is, 'Tell me quickly, what did he say?' – it’s over. The teacher also pointed out that if you abruptly stop someone from speaking, and your relationship is not strong enough, they might become angry and embarrassed. That wouldn’t be good. Instead, you can say, 'I understand, I know about this.' This is also a skillful approach. You can even add, 'He’s very good to me. He is good to me in this way, and that way...' Then the other person won't be able to continue their complaint. Also, if it’s not appropriate to offer advice, say, 'Excuse me, I need to use the restroom,' and just leave.

People need to have self-awareness. If you know that listening will leave a mark, and yet you still listen, isn't that simply following your bad habits? In the past, our teacher studied with three monks, who were the eminent contemporary high monks and virtuous ones in Taiwan, with profound learning. Because of their learning, many people were jealous and slandered them. However, our teacher, at such a young age, already had the wisdom to respond to these challenges. He didn’t listen, otherwise, he would have ruined the opportunity to learn from such good teachers. People are especially prone to forming first impressions, so unless you gradually adjust yourself to the point where you are not easily influenced or marked by others’ words, to the point that you can listen objectively and evaluate – if you have this ability, then you’re okay. If you haven’t reached that point, then you must be self-aware. Like some elders we know, they are like Judge Bao, excellent at discerning cases. Even when we speak to them and are biased, they immediately see it, and we can’t continue the conversation. People with virtue have this ability.

Furthermore, when we criticize, from a broader perspective, it affects the harmony of the entire group. If we have a big-picture perspective, we will gradually subdue this habit. We will love ourselves, love others, and love the group. Criticism is different from giving advice. The motivation behind advice is to benefit the other person, and you also consider the occasion, the timing, and use gentle language, "pleasing his countenance and softening your voice," this is called giving advice; this is called protecting and caring for the other person. Criticism is simply an expression of your displeasure, giving in to a fleeting moment of self-gratification.

Furthermore, being assertive can easily lead to misunderstanding and blaming others unjustly. We must gradually adjust these tendencies through life, through our own habits and thoughts. As I just wrote for everyone: 'Those of shallow virtue are arrogant and unkind, seeing others as displeasing.' They see everything wrong with everyone. The key is that they lack loyalty and understanding within their hearts. Therefore, the teacher extracted four characters from Confucianism and four from Buddhism. These characters encompass all teachings of Confucianism and Buddhism, respectively. For Confucianism: 'Benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and understanding'; for Buddhism: 'Truthfulness, sincerity, compassion, and kindness.'

Why do people who are arrogant and assertive want to prove themselves? They say things like, “I’m telling you, he is definitely like this or that.” What do they seek to prove? What benefit do they gain from such assertiveness? I think we should calmly consider this. If something benefits neither you nor others, don't do it. Otherwise, you are just following bad habits, you are being foolish, lacking wisdom. It’s self-harm and harming others, why do it? So, what is it? It’s a lack of loyalty and understanding. What is loyalty? It's doing your best to help the other person, ‘to do one’s utmost is called loyalty.’ We don’t even have enough time to do our best, so why criticize, why be assertive? Therefore, it’s a lack of loyalty.

Some people might say, 'Yes, I do my best for my good friends, but I don’t put in the effort for people I dislike.' I ask you, is that truly loyalty to your good friends? It is worth considering. How is the character ‘loyalty’ written? The character for ‘heart’ (心) is in the middle (中), it refers to the middle way. If you help one person but not another, it's already not in the middle, how can that be loyalty? ‘But he really does his best.’ What force is driving him then? It’s the power of ‘love and hate’, the energy of likes and dislikes. You help them with all your might because you like them. I tell you, can liking stay the same? It is not genuine, it will change. ‘I hate that person.’ I guarantee that you first loved them. You loved them, but there were conditions attached. When they didn't reciprocate, you began to hate them. How can this be called justice? It might fool some people, but it can't fool someone with true insight. Without equality, compassion and kindness, nothing comes from the true heart, don’t deceive yourself, that is the most pitiful thing. You are clearly not a person of loyalty and justice, but you often think you are, and so you don't even know where your thinking is wrong, how can you improve?

Therefore, people are always swayed by discriminative thinking. If someone is harsh to you, you treat them with extra politeness. If someone is gentle, you will let them down knowing they won't hold it against you. Aren't people showing discrimination, bullying the kind and fearing the wicked? You should be even more respectful to those who are kind to you, that is the right attitude. It's not okay to think, ‘Well, they won't scold me anyway.’ From these responses in how we deal with others, we can see that deep inside, there are still many bad habits we need to subdue. ‘Only from the heart’s most hidden origins, silently cleanse and scrub away’. I recommend that you all go back and read the *Liaofan's Four Lessons*. It explains very well what is straight and what is crooked. In our heart, let there not be a shred of flattery, no hidden agenda, nor self-importance.

So if we have loyalty, we only think of how we can do our best to help that person, help with that matter, and we won’t criticize. With understanding, we show forgiveness, we don’t take it to heart. And even what? This understanding of forgiveness is 'like his heart.' Even though he did not do well, we don't emotionally deny him completely, we can see his intentions, and we can see his difficulties. We first affirm him, and then we assist him. 'When we see others make mistakes, we don't criticize but assist them'.

Furthermore, to counteract arrogance, the elder has a Dharma saying: 'Others’ mistakes are also correct, my correctness is also wrong.' Why is it that other people’s mistakes are also correct? It’s a normal phenomenon. If they haven’t been taught, how can they have tolerance and forgiveness? ‘My correctness is also wrong’, because when we have an idea of ‘I’m right’, we become engrossed in arguing right and wrong, and an attitude of superiority emerges. If I am wrong, then I’m already being led astray by my bad habits, and of course, I am wrong. Do family members argue right and wrong, or do they seek to benefit each other? Therefore, the home is not a court of law, it is a place of affection. If we talk about affection, then we show mutual love and care. If we talk about logic, then we will drive each other to the point of exasperation. This is about being perceptive of human nature and principles.

Recently on Monday, in the *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts*, we spoke about 'When arguing about matters, who knows if the fault is not with myself, we must calmly and secretly reflect.' When we always feel that we are right, that is arrogance, and it means we don't understand reflection. ‘When arguing about matters,’ a conflict has already happened. ‘Who knows if the fault is not with myself,’ do I have a fault? 'I'm not that wrong, I am only two parts wrong, they are eight parts wrong.' That's still wrong. When people acknowledge their fault, they will feel embarrassed and they will not continue to be angry. When we say, 'I'm only a little bit wrong' that means you have not acknowledged any fault, you are still focused on how much the other person is wrong.  When we feel we have a fault, our aggression will gradually subside. Otherwise, if we continue thinking: I'm holding on to their eight parts of wrong, and they'll be holding on to my two parts, won't we be fighting like dogs? It is very unseemly. 'When we blame each other, the world will turn upside down'.

An idiom easily explains this: 'It takes two hands to clap'. There is much truth in it. When two people can argue, it means they are at a similar level, 'half a pound and eight ounces'. If they are at a similar level, what is there to be arrogant about? What is there to argue about? Once you think like this, your heart calms down, and you become embarrassed. Some may say, 'Is there a situation where one person is completely not wrong, and the other is completely wrong?' Yes, there is, where one person is completely not wrong and the other person is entirely at fault. Does the person who is without fault not suffer a loss? I assure you they do not suffer loss, they will become a saint, their blessings and wisdom will be perfected, how can they suffer? People sometimes don't think deeply or far enough, they only think in the moment: 'I can't take it anymore, don't tell me'. Emperor Shun had no fault, yet he still admitted fault. That is true cultivation. 'Wise people fight for the blame, foolish people fight for the right'. 'Foolish people fighting for the right', when they fight, the family is divided, the group is divided; 'Wise people fighting for the blame', always saying it’s my fault, when others look, they realize that he didn’t make any mistake, he shoulders the blame, and everyone’s anger subsides. When you see your children fighting, and their father immediately bows and admits fault to the other person, your children will shed tears of shame.

Including when we look at the Five Relationships, in every relationship there may be someone completely without fault, and those people reach very high levels of achievement in the end. They truly don’t suffer. Emperor Shun’s wisdom and accomplishments, the blessings manifested and he became Emperor. In the *Textbook on Moral Education*, we find the story of ‘Zhang Li Beggar’s Care’. Her husband passed away early, leaving a blind mother-in-law, and she also had a bad temper, often scolding and hitting her. Zhang Li, being a woman, was already struggling to survive as a beggar, and she also had to support a blind and ill-tempered mother-in-law. Ladies, can you imagine being in this situation? If you were in this role, what would you do? In the end, she achieved a very high level of accomplishment, passing away without illness. She used all her money to hold a memorial service for her mother-in-law, and then she shaved her hair and became a nun. She passed away peacefully in a seated position at over eighty years old. She was extremely blessed. The greatest blessing is to be free of illness at the time of death, leaving peacefully.

We now move to ‘Strict in Self-Discipline,’ the fifth effort of the heart: ‘Not to Doubt’. Let us first try to understand how this doubt can devastate ourselves. When a person doubts themselves it’s like falling into a bottomless abyss, not knowing where the bottom is. You think, 'I have no strength anymore. I can't do it, I can’t learn it.' You just keep sinking. The ancient people spoke of the unity of heaven and humanity, the entire natural world and the human heart have a reciprocal influence. Recall that twenty years ago, it was rare to hear of a large sinkhole appearing suddenly in a city, where entire buildings and cars would fall in, even bridges would collapse. Have you ever heard of that? Now this kind of news is not rare. When people’s doubts become more and more severe, the earth will sink. It is the same as when people lose confidence, it feels like falling into a bottomless abyss. The unity of heaven and humanity is real, not fake. When human hearts are good, the weather will be fair. When human hearts are unkind, there will be many natural disasters. The ancient people knew this truth, and when they saw this chaos, they would immediately reflect upon themselves and ask themselves to correct their mistakes. Who should be the first? The Emperor, the Son of Heaven, should be the first to go to the Temple of Heaven to repent. When he does this, he leads the people to reflect on themselves, so the disasters will quickly disappear.

Doubt is also very devastating to others, and to the group. For example, if one of your good friends doesn’t believe in you, you would surely feel extremely sad. Furthermore, if a group doesn't trust each other, the group will break down anytime, because there is no trust. ‘Since ancient times, death has been inevitable, but a nation cannot stand without trust.’ Without mutual trust and with doubt, a group even with one hundred or one thousand people can fall apart in an instant, it is very fragile. But if there is mutual trust, nobody can influence it. If two people have the same heart, their strength can even break gold. ‘If three brothers and four siblings are of one mind, dirt at the front door will turn into gold’. We can see how the traditional teachings are now spreading, in the beginning, it was only a few people who trusted each other, and their combined strength was like a great wall. We’ve learned if others don't believe in me, I must believe in them. Gradually this atmosphere will spread from you. If others don't agree with me, I must agree with them. Actually, who doesn't want to be at peace with others? Who wants to doubt others? When we completely trust others, that sincerity will touch them, ‘If one is sincere enough, even metal and stone can be penetrated’.

People now wish to build up their self-confidence, but from what we observe, there are not many people who have confidence, and even the confidence they have can change with circumstances. First, why is it that many don't have confidence? It's because from the time we were young, we have been constantly comparing ourselves to others. This culture of comparison is too evident, constantly comparing. Like me, I was always very unconfident. Firstly, my grades were not good, when I was small my grades were always in the teens or twenties. When I went home, I didn’t dare to raise my head, I felt embarrassed. Secondly, I was only 155 centimeters tall when I graduated from primary school, when I stood there, I felt like, 'It's over, will I be the same height as my mother?' Every day, I was comparing myself to my mother: ‘Mom, why am I about the same height as you?’ Now when I think about it, it is very unfilial, I should repent. ‘A child does not dislike his mother for being ugly,’ how could I dislike my mother for being short? At that time, that was the culture, I was very self-conscious, I wanted to be taller. When I went to school, some of my female classmates were already over 160 centimeters. When we were in junior high, the girls grew taller first, the boys were later, and my female classmates (we can’t blame them, they hadn’t studied *Di Zi Gui*) would walk next to me and compare, and I would feel very unconfident. In this kind of environment, if a person can have self-confidence, then that is not easy. Unless they have entered the truth, otherwise it's simply arrogance, not true self-confidence. If a person is comparing themselves to others, how can they have true self-confidence? Unless they truly understand the truth. What truth? 'I inherently have bright virtue', I inherently have pure goodness, and I can definitely restore this. So why should I be unconfident?

Therefore, the classics can open up our wisdom, they can open up a correct attitude towards life. ‘The way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating one's bright virtue.’ I have bright virtue, why should I be unconfident? I have pure goodness, ‘At the beginning of man, his nature is good,’ I will not be unconfident. ‘If not properly taught, his nature will change.’ I still have bad habits, but I will not be arrogant. Therefore, the classics are very useful. When a few lines are absorbed into the heart, your attitude will change, you will be neither unconfident nor arrogant. Why? I have bad habits, but bad habits can be changed, I can still restore my pure goodness, why should I be unconfident? ‘Do not harm yourself, do not give up on yourself, sages and the virtuous are reachable.’

Therefore, confidence must be built upon truth, definitely not built upon external conditions for comparison. If you say, I am very confident because I am tall, what if you went to the NBA? Those people are even taller than you, would you still be confident? If you say you have high qualifications, there are still those who are even more qualified, there are always people outside of people, and heavens beyond heavens. If your confidence is built upon these conditions, sooner or later they will change. They are not real. You say that you are born disabled, how can you have confidence? From the news reports I’ve seen, there are some people born without legs or arms, but are incredibly optimistic. When they give speeches, the students below are moved to tears, they feel noble about their own character, and they feel noble for their determination to serve the society. When these students see this, they think, 'I have arms and legs, and they have no arms or legs but still benefit the people.' They are moved by them, they are also not unconfident.

There are many examples like this. I've seen that Yutaka Ototake from Japan, he is a bestselling author, his smile is just like a baby’s. He has no arms, and seems he also has some disabilities in his legs, but his parents were very admirable, they never treated him as abnormal. They treated him as a normal person, they used the correct attitude to treat him, and he is very capable, very optimistic. When we are parents or teachers or leaders, if we use this kind of truth to treat everyone, if we believe in everyone, and don’t doubt anyone.

We know that the classics won't deceive us, so starting today, will we lose confidence because of something that happens? Will we deflate like a punctured balloon because of something that was said? ‘At the beginning of man, his nature is good’; ‘The way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating one's bright virtue,’ ‘All sentient beings possess the same wisdom and virtues as the Tathagata.’ When we take one line of scripture into our hearts, we gain great benefit. A few days ago, a friend asked, 'Why do you believe so strongly in what the classics say? Why do you believe so strongly in what the sages say?' I said, 'When people deceive others, they usually have some kind of motive, if they don’t have a motive, why would they deceive you?' So, as the teacher said, these sages have given so much teaching, most of which we understand, are truths, but for some of the deeper levels, we cannot understand. Then, first, we must trust that the parts they said that we can understand are correct. And for the parts that we cannot understand, we should trust that they only have your benefit in mind and they won't try to deceive you, they don’t want to gain any advantage from you.

Therefore, what is the first thing we must do? We must trust in the words of the sages, and not doubt the classics. These people have good roots. Because you can judge, that most of the teachings they gave, that you can understand, are correct. For the parts that you don't understand, you must faithfully do as they instruct, and you will slowly be able to reach that state of understanding. The sage is on the twentieth floor, we are on the third or fourth floor, so of course we have to listen to their teaching and slowly climb up. When you understand, and truly believe, this is 'belief and understanding'. If you truly ‘put into practice’, then you will 'realize,' which means you will reach the same level of understanding as them, and as you are doing it, you will understand that it is indeed the truth.

Okay, now that we have built our confidence, but our own foundation is still relatively poor, it doesn't matter. ‘If others do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times. If one can indeed do this, then even if one is stupid, they will become wise; even if one is weak, they will become strong.’ People tend to not believe in themselves and tend to look for excuses. For example, 'I was previously educated in English, how can I promote Chinese culture?' Can you do it? Yes, perfect! Wonderful! Why? Those who were educated in English and have focused on studying well, will make all those who grew up reading Chinese feel ashamed! Aren't they awakening everyone’s sense of shame? If they didn’t have this background they wouldn't be able to rouse so many people. Doesn’t that make sense? You are not reacting? You need to give me a round of applause, otherwise, I will lose confidence – I'm wrong, confidence can’t be built upon the applause of others.

To be honest, all those memories that are usually seen as very bad, if we change our perspective, can be the greatest opportunity to teach sentient beings. ‘Both favorable and adverse circumstances are good circumstances’. Every situation is the best, if you look at it with awareness, it will be the best.  What status did Lao Bai Fang Li have? What wealth did he have? Yet his contribution to education was so great! His support for education inspired all people in China, and even people overseas were moved to tears when they heard his story. Because of his background and his selfless and selfless dedication to education, it moved everyone. ‘My conditions are better than his, how can I not do it?’ Therefore, all the elders, do not say, ‘I am seventy years old, I am too old.’ Perfect! You make a vow, even if you don't say a word, just sitting in the middle with your white hair will move everyone, and I guarantee you will extend your life by twenty years. This is so important. Chinese culture can save the world. It is an important task to continue to inherit this culture. If you make a vow, the ancestors will immediately bless you.

There is a basis for what I am saying. Teacher Li Bingnan, such a wise man, when he saw that a student had a short life span, he asked him to promote the righteous Dharma, and thus extended his life span. See how skillful teacher Li Bingnan was, he asked our teacher to learn to speak on the sutras. 'You just take a look, their education is only at the elementary school level.' See his skillful approach. Our teacher thought, ‘If elementary school graduates can do it, then I, a junior high graduate, can also do it.’ Otherwise, our teacher felt he was not capable. This skillful approach allowed him to feel at ease and he started to learn. Our teacher was supposed to die at 45 years old, and he’s already extended his life for over 40 years, and he is still very healthy. So we also have confidence. In this way, studying Chinese classics, each person can study one sutra for 10 years, regardless of gender or age, everyone can join in. This concludes the section on ‘strict in self-discipline.’

Next, is ‘treat others with kindness’. This is the principle of understanding. Forgiveness, where does kindness manifest? When one's heart is open, they don't differentiate between self and others, they put themselves in others’ shoes and they show their kindness in dealing with others.  Furthermore, not being calculative also represents their kindness. There is nothing that cannot be tolerated. The teacher said, 'There is no one in the world that I hate, there is no one in the world that I cannot forgive, there is no one in the world that I cannot love.' If that is so, who are you still going to be calculating with? Thirdly, where does kindness manifest itself? In kindness and generosity, to treat others with kindness and generosity. Using these three points, I share this with you. First, putting yourself in the shoes of others. When we put ourselves in others’ shoes, we first won’t make others feel ashamed, secondly we won’t be arrogant, and thirdly, we can empathize with others.


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**Translation:**

We're revisiting a story. In our discussion of *Qun Shu Zhi Yao* (《群書治要》), we touched upon the *Shuo Yuan* (《說苑》), mentioning how King Zhuang of Chu once hosted a banquet for his ministers. After drinking, one minister, perhaps unable to control himself, ended up pulling at the sleeve of one of the king's concubines. This concubine was also quite astute; the moment her clothes were touched, she immediately tore off the man's hat tassel. Now, as the minister pulled her sleeve, a gust of wind blew out all the candles. The concubine then went directly to King Zhuang, saying, "One of your ministers has behaved inappropriately towards me. He pulled at my sleeve. You must relight the candles immediately and have him seized!" But King Zhuang, after listening, said, "How can I embarrass my minister to uphold your virtue as a woman? Moreover, I invited everyone to this banquet, to have a good time and drink freely. A little impropriety is to be expected." So, King Zhuang announced, "Today, we're all going to enjoy ourselves to the fullest. If no one ends up tearing off their hat tassels from drinking, we won't have had enough fun!" With that, everyone tore off their tassels, the candles were relit, and the matter was dropped.

Later, during a battle where the forces were evenly matched, one particular minister charged into the enemy lines time and again. Ultimately, they were victorious. King Zhuang was very moved. "I don't believe I’ve treated you exceptionally well," he said, "so why did you fight so hard for me?" The minister then replied, "Your Majesty, many years ago, at the banquet when the candles went out, I was the one who pulled at the sleeve of your concubine. At the time, you showed me leniency, and I have always remembered your kindness." So, by not embarrassing someone, he ultimately… saved a life. But had he embarrassed him, might he have lost his life, right? People will hold a grudge.

Therefore, the adage reminds us, "A single act can impact a person's entire life." Did this particular event impact that minister's entire life? Absolutely. If those candles had been relit, his reputation would have been ruined for life. Every time people saw him, they would think, "That's the man who behaved inappropriately with the king's concubine." How would he be able to live? Or, perhaps people were once ignorant, faced some family difficulties, and you know about it. You can’t bring it up. You can’t say, “Did you know what they were like before?” That’s just unkind. "Look at a person's later years; a prodigal son who returns is priceless." Some people enjoy inquiring about other’s pasts and telling others. Are you trying to block their path to reform? Thus, "A single act can impact a person's entire life. Even if you see it or hear it for certain, do not speak of it." Leave people a way out; encourage them. "A single word that wounds my generosity" – words that lack kindness, that insult or belittle others – are unacceptable. Or it will become a habit, a good way to make fun of others, and this harms your virtues. "Even in casual or joking conversations," even after-dinner chats, you should not say those things. "Be careful not to put it into words." This is how we cultivate respect for others, not to speak carelessly. Because something that will effect a person’s entire life gets spread around, this means "One word can waste half a lifetime of good fortune," because you’re blocking their path. This is why elders advise us to accumulate 'mouth virtue' – accumulate good merit through our words. Where do you accumulate good merit? It begins with controlling your speech. Otherwise, you will leak everything.

The first point is not to embarrass others. There's another story, about being lenient towards others, and that reminds us of Liu Kuan. Not only did he avoid embarrassing people, he didn't want anyone to feel uncomfortable. Once, while riding his ox on the road, a farmer approached him, declaring, "That's my ox! How can you be taking my ox?" The farmer was indignant, so sure it was his ox. Liu Kuan apologized profusely, "I'm so sorry, please take it back." The people at that time were quite honest; they wouldn't try to seize someone else’s ox. This man just mistook it for his. Otherwise, continued argument might have physically harmed this man. "Quickly, you should take it back." When the farmer returned home, he found his ox had come back. "Ah, I was mistaken!" Upon finding out it was Lord Liu Kuan, he was scared to death and immediately returned the ox to Liu Kuan. Liu Kuan immediately said, "Oxen all look very similar. It's normal to make a mistake. It's very normal.” He gave him a way out, "Thank you for bringing it back to me."

When we encountered this story, we were filled with admiration. After admiring it, we must emulate it, this kind of responsive flexibility. Our ancestors taught us to read the words and stories left behind by sages; people will gain insight, and their character will slowly broaden. It’s said that one reading of “The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars” without shedding tears indicates a lack of filial piety. Let’s test this out. What if you read “The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars” and don’t cry? Read it again. You have to believe in yourself. Surely, little by little, you’ll melt your hardened heart.

Secondly, be not arrogant; be mindful that when arrogance arises, it makes others feel very uncomfortable. I have shared with everyone before that my older sister was always first in her class, whereas I was always in the teens or twenties. Therefore, when dealing with siblings, if you do well in school, make a lot of money, have high education, you must be careful. You can inadvertently press your siblings. So, if you're particularly successful, you have to be even more cautious. Don’t go back and say, “It’s too simple; too easy.” You’re causing internal pain. Because everyone’s time for awakening is different. If you awaken first, you can’t use your talent to belittle others. "Do not use your own strengths to overshadow others; do not use your own goodness to compare with others; do not use your own abilities to put others in a difficult situation." Rather, "Contain your talents." This is extremely important. People these days lack confidence; if we start boasting, it will make them very uncomfortable. My second oldest sister never flaunted or boasted about her grades, so I never felt any pressure from her.

Furthermore, my parents never compared me to others. That is why, despite my circumstances, I wasn't warped. It's because my parents and older sisters never competed, nor did they pressure me. Therefore, I am grateful for their kindness; my character is reasonably healthy. After listening to this passage, we should reflect on how we treat our parents and all our relatives. We must be careful of inadvertently becoming arrogant. Even worse, a parent may not be literate, while their child has a Master’s or Doctoral degree, and then that arrogant attitude comes out. Where would we be without our parents? That's extremely inappropriate.

Not only should we not be arrogant, but we should also give people confidence. There was an entrepreneur whose brother-in-law worked in his company. His performance wasn't ideal, and so his in-laws often said to him, "We’re so sorry, my son isn't doing well, causing you trouble." Upon hearing this, the entrepreneur thought, “That’s true, he doesn’t perform well.” To be honest, at that moment, he only thought about how he had seen his brother-in-law’s faults. He didn’t realize that a parent would feel so much pain and sadness when speaking ill of their own son in front of their son-in-law.

So, people are different after they learn. He was able to empathize with his in-laws' feelings. Once he realized this, it changed. When his in-laws would talk about it, he immediately cut them off saying, "Dad, Mom, it's my fault. I didn't manage my brother well; he's actually very good." Then he would highlight all of his good qualities. Why? Because everyone has good qualities. Hearing this, his in-laws were very touched. Furthermore, is there a chance this could reach his brother-in-law? Very likely. His conscience will be awakened. “I performed so poorly; my brother-in-law not only didn’t blame me, but blamed himself. How could I let him down?” But if his attitude wasn’t like that, if he was still just seeing his brother-in-law’s faults, and he were to add to his in-laws complaints, it would be over.

So, be not arrogant, always consider the feelings of others, and always reflect on one's own shortcomings. I believe this will slowly resolve the various disagreements within a family. "Eliminating conflicts within a family is a great accomplishment." This is truly internalizing and applying teachings in your interactions with others. "People can propagate the Way." When you truly put it into practice, your family and those around you will surely be moved. This is about not being arrogant.

Third, feel with empathy – "feel another's hunger as your own; feel another's drowning as your own." This is having empathy. When we’re at school and we have a new colleague, they’re not familiar with the environment and are bound to feel nervous. If you can feel with them and treat them as you would your own family, they'll quickly feel at ease and integrate. I heard a teacher share that when he first joined the school, during nap time, a colleague put his own jacket over him as he slept. He was deeply touched. When we are together, the fact that we meet is due to fate, so always try to care for each other as if they were you. When an experienced person leads a newcomer, the newcomer will quickly integrate.

Alright, one more story, which should also be familiar to everyone, is about the wife of Mr. Yang Chengzhai. At 70 years of age, she would wake up early to cook porridge for the servants. Her children couldn't bear to watch, and told her "Mother, you’re so old, why are you getting up so early?” She responded, "They're all someone’s children; they have parents and families. If they’re doing well, their families will be at ease. Also, it’s so cold; it’s not healthy to work without some warmth in your belly. So I cook some porridge so they can eat before work.” She loved others as she loved herself, and had true empathy. Regarding breastfeeding, she breastfed all seven of her children herself. She said, if she lets others breastfeed, she will rob the milk of other children, and she herself would breastfeed. Despite her high status and wealth, she still possessed an undimmed and loving heart towards others. In the end, three out of four of her children passed the imperial exams. The kind-hearted are sure to receive great blessings.

Okay, that’s all for today's sharing. Next week, we’ll continue with the final major unit, which is self-education from "cultivating ethics, fulfilling one's duties, guarding against evil, and preserving sincerity." “Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself” is a state of mind, a guiding principle. But the specific application must be rooted in ethical conduct and fulfilling our responsibilities, and in the process of doing so, to constantly guard against evil and preserve sincerity, to contemplate whether our actions are coming from a truly sincere, pure, and compassionate heart. Alright, thank you all!


Okay, here's my professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and a natural English flow:

**Lecture 18: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Fulfilling Social Roles and Maintaining Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

Our topic, "Being a Mentor for a Child's Whole Life," has reached its seventh major point: "The Importance of Self-Education." In self-education, the first thing we must recognize is that "educators must first be educated." Especially in this day and age, because we have received so little traditional culture and ethical education, we may have studied in teacher training colleges, or come to promote traditional culture by chance, and our students then call us teachers. In fact, our foundations are not yet strong. So, our generation is really engaging in “learning from mistakes”; it is remedial education. We absolutely cannot overestimate our own abilities simply because others call us "teacher." Mencius reminds us that "everyone likes to be a teacher." This tendency is easily triggered, so we must be extremely careful to subdue this arrogant desire to instruct others.

For example, if students are not receptive to our teaching, we cannot criticize them for being unteachable. We must instead reflect on whether our own patience is lacking. In the process of interacting with the student, have I lost my temper? This is self-education. If we do not first demand things of ourselves, but immediately demand things of students, then in terms of human nature, they will not be able to accept it. For example, we tell children not to lose their temper, but we ourselves are losing our temper while speaking to them. Not only will students not accept this, but others will find it difficult to accept as well. So, to be able to subdue this desire to be a teacher, we must return to the idea that only one person is a student, while everyone else is an examiner, observing whether our self-cultivation has reached the proper level.

In fact, it is very easy for us to get caught up in trying to argue about who is right and who is wrong. It's as if we won't be satisfied until we’ve proven that we're right and they're wrong. But if we think calmly, the five cardinal relationships are all about morality and affection. Isn’t arguing about right and wrong harming the relationship? People become attached to reason when looking at and demanding things of others. When attached to logic, affection suffers, and if human emotion is harmed, then in fact, reason has been abandoned.  Those who are well versed in human affairs know that in the family, we don’t deal with logic or use logic to demand things of our family. Dealing with family members by logic will only infuriate you; instead, you have to deal with them with affection, with feelings. Affection leads to mutual love and care.

Since it’s about affection, we should be thinking of the other person in every thought. We remind ourselves that, originally, we wanted what was best for them. How did it turn into an argument about right and wrong? But it is often the case. Clearly we want what is best for our spouse, and in trying to advise them, we end up stuck on, "I’m doing this for your own good, so why are you acting this way? I can't stand it; I can't swallow this." Then we have strayed far from our initial intention. Yes, we’ve changed. Therefore, people need to maintain consistency with a sincere heart. If our hearts are inconsistent, we’re called fickle people.

Respected elders and fellow students, have you ever met a fickle person? Has anyone ever made you lose your appetite for three days, or kept you awake for three years? Thinking it over carefully, aren’t we ourselves fickle people? Have we shown unwavering devotion to our parents? We made promises when we were young to give our parents a good life, but now we forget our mothers after getting married. This too is fickleness. When married couples get married, do they remember the promises they made? Have they been consistent?

It's really difficult for a person to not use logic to demand things of others. There is a method, which we mentioned earlier: see yourself as the student, and everyone else as the teacher. For example, if someone else becomes fickle, it's a lesson for us, teaching us that we can’t be like them. They are also teaching us. So, if they are fickle, we should remain consistent. A truly consistent person will undoubtedly move the fickle person beside them. Do you all believe this? If you’re not reacting, that is a very serious problem, very serious. Why? Those who are in education must first believe in "At the beginning of human life, people are inherently good."

How could a person with a sincere heart not move those around them? "Sincerity can penetrate even metal and stone." If we cannot agree with this, we probably don’t believe this truth deep down. If we are working in education, we might think, "Look, look, they are simply hopeless; they have no good roots. I've talked to them so many times." And we become more and more biased, distrusting and prejudiced against them. In reality, when we say that someone else has no good roots, we need to ask, who is it that has no good roots? It is us who has doubts about others, who doubt "At the beginning of human life, people are inherently good." It's us who have no good roots, not them. So, without introspection, we tend to see other people’s faults, and fail to see whether our own mentality has become skewed.

Therefore, if we want to refrain from acting impulsively and emotionally, we first have to cultivate the skill of “not seeing the faults of the world.” We should see everyone as a teacher, coming to improve our practice. If they become fickle, I will not. If I cannot move them, it means my virtue is not enough. How then can we focus on their faults? “There is no one in the world who cannot be reformed, only fear that sincerity has not yet arrived.” This is not just a saying to memorize, but one to use to remind ourselves so we don’t dwell on other people’s mistakes.

Our ancestor, Great Shun, lived in the area of Leize at a time when everyone was fighting and snatching from each other. He felt great pity when he saw this. Notice that while seeing that those people didn’t know how to yield to each other, and were only fighting and snatching, did King Shun see their faults? Did he criticize them? No. Therefore, the benevolent are invincible! Instead, what did he feel? Pity. “Oh, how could people, the descendants of Yan and Huang, how could humans, with heaven, earth, and humanity, be so controlled by their habits and be unable to take charge?” Their fighting and snatching will only make them and their customs worse, and their lives more destitute. He pitied them because King Shun understood the truth: that yielding, forbearance, and humility would bring harmony and blessings.

They all had their original goodness, but they did not understand the truth. How could they be brought to enlightenment? King Shun didn't try to persuade them with reasoning, but rather led by example. While they fought, he didn't emphasize their wickedness. Because "emphasizing others' wickedness is wickedness itself. The more severe the denunciation, the more trouble you will create." First, the person whose wickedness is emphasized cannot accept it and may become angry, leading to conflict. Second, those who hear us emphasizing wickedness may all join in to criticize others' faults, and in doing so, we will corrupt the atmosphere of the group. We should think twice before speaking and acting. Only speak and act in a way that benefits both yourself and others. Something that doesn’t benefit yourself or others is irrational, and such a thing should not be done. In our last lecture we emphasized not being "foolish," but being rational.

As a result, King Shun didn’t criticize them. But when he saw someone give way, he would praise them, and he himself would take the initiative to give way. In about a year, the customs of that region completely changed, and that wasn’t just one person. So, if we can’t move our relatives and friends around us, we need to reflect and use King Shun as a model to fully implement *Standards for Being a Good Student* and these teachings. Because everyone has a conscience. If someone with a hot temper has someone by their side who never loses their temper, their sense of shame will gradually be awakened. If a greedy person has someone selfless by their side, they will feel embarrassed. This proves that "At the beginning of human life, people are inherently good."

So, since our relationships are rooted in affection and morality, we shouldn’t use logic to suppress people and argue about who is right or wrong. We should start with ourselves, in every thought, always thinking of the other person. Regardless of what happens, we cannot change this intention. As soon as this changes, we become fickle. As soon as this changes, greed, anger, ignorance, and arrogance arise, and everything is driven by emotions.

At the very beginning, the importance of self-education is that educators must first be educated. Today, we have discussed that a teacher or educator must first educate themselves by constantly considering the student, and considering whether their intention is to help the student succeed. No matter how great the difficulties, they must be overcome to help the student succeed. We can see that Confucius had many students who followed him for decades, and the Master never grew tired of teaching them. So, "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I?" What kind of person was the Master? "Those who strive can achieve the same." Since we have chosen this path, we must encourage ourselves by aspiring to be as virtuous as the sages.

Secondly, self-education is very important. Through reminding ourselves that we must first be educated, and in the process of examining and educating ourselves, we must put in the effort to correct any faults we find. So the second point is, “correcting our faults.” What is the motivation for correcting our faults? It is still compassion, still the desire to benefit the students. Because if we don’t correct our bad habits, they will unknowingly have a negative influence on our students. We have embarked on this path to benefit students, so how could we want to negatively influence them? But if we do not change, we will have a negative impact every single day. Therefore, the position of a teacher is different from that of ordinary secular jobs. Since we have made that choice, we must have the determination to correct our faults once we discover them. Moreover, those who work in education often receive salaries from the government, so they must be worthy of the people and taxpayers. If we work in traditional culture, then we must be worthy of the support of the masses. We must all have this spirit to quickly "advance in virtue daily, and decrease our faults daily."

Our third point is that, in correcting our faults, one important principle is, "Be strict with yourself and lenient with others." Being strict with yourself means first subduing our greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt. Correcting faults starts with the fundamentals, with our intentions and thoughts. If we have no evil thoughts in our hearts, it is naturally impossible to have bad speech or behavior. And being strict with yourself is to achieve self-cultivation, and being lenient with others is to live in harmony with others; this is also the "way of forgiveness."

In the last lecture we discussed being lenient with others; the first point is to put ourselves in their shoes. A specific way to express this is, as we mentioned last time, to not embarrass others. Also, to not be conceited and arrogant. Zeng Guofan said that the reason people are disliked is because of “pride.” If you are conceited and arrogant, you put a lot of pressure on others, making them uncomfortable. Your words are sharp, and always want to suppress and outdo others. This shows that you are not thinking of others. Another is empathy. In our last lecture, we mentioned that when a newcomer comes to our school or workplace, we can remember that we were also once new, and were also very nervous when we arrived at a new place. If we can think of them and warmly welcome them, and enthusiastically familiarize them with all the environment and work, then they will feel as comfortable as they would at their own home.

For example, when a new daughter-in-law enters a family, she will inevitably be uneasy. If everyone in the family can empathize with her and make her feel at ease in many ways, and not be too tense, that would be good. For example, she might have only started learning to cook one or two months before getting married, which seems to be quite common these days. When she first gets married, her cooking skills may not be great. So when she steams the buns, they might end up so hard you could throw them at someone and give them a concussion. Seriously. I once heard a friend say that his wife's first attempt at steaming buns was disastrous. He joked with his wife, miming how he could knock someone out with those buns. His wife was helpless, because that’s how the buns came out. But then her father-in-law picked one up and ate it, and said, “Hmm, not bad.” He was doing it on purpose. And his daughter-in-law was very touched, that her father-in-law was so understanding and was encouraging her. Later, her relationship with her father-in-law was very good, like that of a daughter and father. So, if people can empathize with others, they can make a good friend, and these five cardinal relationships will be harmonious.

This includes how a master should treat servants. She knew that they woke up in the cold weather, and that if they didn’t eat something to warm their stomachs, it would be particularly harmful. Although she was already an old lady in her seventies, she was still so diligent in caring for these servants. In fact, when we meet any friends, we should always remember that they have parents, they have families, and their families all hope that they are loved and respected at work. If they are bullied or treated with contempt at work, all the family members who care about them will be very sad, right? If we empathize with them and treat them as family, then when they go home, their colleagues will feel like family. Their parents and families will feel very reassured just by hearing them talk about their colleagues. “Oh, my son has colleagues who care for him like siblings.” That will reassure one side of the family.

Okay, let's talk about putting ourselves in other people's shoes and changing perspectives. One of the 64 hexagrams in the *I Ching* is called the "Tai" hexagram, and we often say "misfortune turns to fortune." The Tai hexagram is called "Earth Heaven." From the diagram, earth is on top and heaven is on the bottom. The natural phenomenon should be heaven on top, and earth on the bottom. So it's like heaven and earth have switched positions, switching perspectives. In a group, such as a nation with a ruler and subjects, or a leader and people, the ruler is like heaven. If the emperor can think of the people, and the people can understand the difficulties of the leaders, then there will be mutual understanding, and the nation will be strong. Okay, this is how we see it from the perspective of ruler-subject relations. In the family, the husband and father are heaven, and the mother is earth. If the husband can understand his wife's hard work, and the wife can understand the difficulties her husband faces outside the home, then the husband and wife will live harmoniously, respecting each other. Then they will be of one mind, and with the strength of one mind, they can achieve great things, and the family will thrive. But if there is no change of perspective, if the husband is always criticizing his wife, and the wife is laughing at her husband's inability to make money, then the family may not have any peace. There will only be mutual accusations and demands.

In fact, if we look at all five cardinal relationships, we'll see that when conflicts arise between people, if you are an outsider, you might find that there was not much of a problem, because they were just stuck in their own perspectives, and didn’t try to empathize with the other person's difficulties. When someone is doing something, from their perspective, they are also learning; they are not sages. When someone is doing something, they also need a lot of cooperation, and since everyone is still learning, how could they do everything perfectly? But if we are only focused on their mistakes and exaggerating them, they will feel as though, “I’ve put in so much effort, why can’t you understand my difficulties?” Then there is no common ground.

Just change your mindset, and then there is no problem. Be understanding of the other person’s difficulties, praise their efforts, and acknowledge their contributions. Once you acknowledge, they will say, “Oh, no, no, we still have many shortcomings.” This will motivate them to be more proactive, and will naturally cause them to be more self-reflective and improve themselves. Because when people are praised, they will feel fear and gratitude, thinking, “We are still lacking in many ways.” So when interacting with people, do not be stingy with acknowledgment and praise. Don't become someone who only knows how to criticize harshly. That is not good. We need to practice speaking with kindness, often giving words of acknowledgement and words of encouragement.

Secondly, when being lenient with others, you must not be calculative. Learning from the education of the sages, we first must start with expanding our hearts and minds. We cannot have a narrow mind and be calculating wherever we go. Sages are all broadminded and magnanimous, and we must learn this from the heart. How do we learn? As we said earlier, thinking of others in every thought is one way to do this. When we meet with something, we should not be calculating; we must be willing to lose out, and this is also to expand our hearts and minds. Or, when we see other people's strengths, we can praise them. When we see other people's good deeds and good actions, we can praise them. This will expand our hearts. Because if we don't understand the principles of living, it is very easy for jealousy to arise. Fellow students, is there anyone here who doesn't have jealousy? Please raise your hand. I think that person would probably be a sage come back to life, otherwise, they couldn't be so untouched by jealousy, that’s just too amazing. I got infected by it very early. When I saw that someone got good grades, I’d think “What’s so great, they just got lucky.” That just increased my jealousy. Looking at and listening to the actions of the ancient sages and virtuous people will make you feel ashamed.

I remember reading about Yang Zhu of the Ming Dynasty. He became a minister, equivalent to a current-day minister of a government department, and a major government official. He truly displayed being strict with himself and lenient with others. For example, his neighbors’ houses were close together, and every time it rained, rainwater would flood into his yard. His family members were very unhappy, and were complaining. He smiled and said, “Rainy days are few, sunny days are many, it’s okay.” It’s as if many things just disappear if you broaden your mind. There would be no issues in the world if we were just willing to broaden our minds.

Speaking of this, I am reminded of a famous place in Tongcheng, Anhui, called the Six Foot Lane. During the Qing Dynasty, the family of Zhang Ying had many high-ranking officials for generations, and they lived in Tongcheng. His son, Zhang Tingyu, was a renowned minister during the Yongzheng era. It so happened that the Zhang family's relatives and neighbors were in dispute over property boundaries. Zhang's family wrote a letter to him in the capital city to inform him. Usually, when people hear of something like that, they would think, “How outrageous, how dare they argue with us over land.” But after reading the letter, Zhang Ying wrote a reply to his family: “The letter from home is just about a wall.” It’s just about someone building a wall, “Why not give them three feet? The Great Wall is still there, but where is Qin Shi Huang?” What does it matter that Qin Shi Huang was an emperor? He has turned to dust. So you can't take anything with you when you die, so what's the point of fighting?

His family members then read the letter. In those days, they dared not disobey their elders and were very filial. Not only did they not argue, but they moved their own wall back three feet. "If you want to build, go ahead," they said, giving up three feet. When the neighbors saw that the Zhang family had moved their wall back three feet, they said, “If you are a gentleman, then what am I?” So they also moved their wall back three feet. That’s how the Six Foot Lane came to be. This story proves what we were just talking about: if someone is greedy and you are not, they will feel ashamed. If someone is fighting and you are yielding, they will feel ashamed. History has proven that people have a conscience.

I actually had a chance to walk through Six Foot Lane, and found one thing: whenever a car saw someone walking ahead in Six Foot Lane, they stopped moving and waited until the pedestrian passed by before moving. Because in that alley, if the cars and motorcycles keep driving through, what might happen to people? They might feel pressured. So they all know to yield and to not cause pressure on others. Therefore, when they see people, they stop first and wait for them to pass, then they keep going after there is no one in front.

I’d say that even hundreds of years later, the spirit of yielding is still in that lane. Therefore, “Since no man is immortal, let me remain loyal.” Has the spirit of how we treat people been passed down in your own family? Recently, many of our fellow students have been “recounting the virtues of their ancestors.” Their parents were very diligent, their grandparents were charitable. From them, we can see the legacy of virtue passed down by the ancestors and parents, which proves that their parents remained loyal, and that their actions have been a good example for their descendants. And someone like Zhang Ying, a virtuous and learned man, his spirit is still praised and emulated even after thousands of years. He lived his life well, this is what a meaningful life should be like.

Yang Zhu, look, he changed his mind, and there was nothing to be calculative about. How magnanimous was he? His neighbor had a child, and children are easily startled by noises. He rode a donkey to court every day, but the donkey sometimes would bray. He was worried it would startle the baby, so he sold his donkey, and walked to court. That is not easy. He was an official, and many officials are haughty, acting superior to others. But he was thinking about a child. What did we see? Their benevolence had no distinction. Their respect for others had no distinction. This is what true sincerity is.

Being good to one person and not good to another is not true sincerity. That is discrimination, and it is a heart that loves and hates. "But he is so good to them!"


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for clarity, accuracy, and natural flow:

**Translation:**

"His kindness to him is a present thing. If the other person doesn’t comply with his wishes or do things according to his intentions, or if the feedback he receives isn't to his satisfaction, he'll think, 'I'm so good to him, how could he treat me like this?' And then what does that love become? Hatred. As you spend more time together, won’t there be many things you dislike? Won't that turn into hatred? So, that kind of 'love' is actually greedy attachment, not true love. True sincerity is always in harmony with non-discrimination. Therefore, treating everyone with equal respect and equal compassion is the way to use a sincere heart. Everyone, calmly reflect: where does hatred come from? It all comes from love. Today, if a stranger happens to be upset and scolds you a few times, would you be in pain for three years? No, right? You’d think, 'Forget it, don’t bother with him, maybe he lost a lot in the stock market,' and you wouldn't take it to heart. But if it were your husband, and he suddenly said something you couldn’t accept at all, you might give him the cold shoulder for two years. Where does that resentment come from? So, esteemed elders and fellow students, if we still hold resentment towards someone, it’s not that they’ve changed their heart; *we've* changed our hearts. We need to adjust back to our original intention of treating others with consistency.

But let’s calmly observe ourselves. Do we keep our promises to adults, but not to three-year-olds? If we don't keep our word to children, then there’s something strange about keeping our promises to adults. Why do we keep our promises to them? If we break our word, we won't be able to borrow money from them in the future; if they tell others, our reputation will be damaged. But a three-year-old child may not have much impact on us, so it’s okay to fool them for a few days. This is also a wrong attitude.

The story of “Guo Ji at the Pavilion” in the *Moral Education Textbook* is very meaningful. Guo Ji was a high-ranking official in the Han dynasty. Children saw his kind face and gentle eyes; these things resonate with each other. Fellow students, have you ever had a child see you and cry, afraid to come close to you? At times like this, you must reflect on yourself; you might have a killing aura about you. Children loved Guo Ji when they saw him; they would all gather around him and ask, “Sir, what day will you come back?” He would count the days, “Ah, I will come on such-and-such day.” And he would keep it in his heart. He actually came back a day earlier, but in order to fulfill the promise he had made to the children, he spent the night in a pavilion outside the city before entering, because he didn’t want to break his promise to the children. So, treating everyone equally with respect is the right thing to do.

From Yang Zhu's considerate attention to a child, we can imagine that the people of his jurisdiction were very fortunate when he became an official. Later, one day, the gravestone of his family's ancestral tomb was pushed over. In ancient times, people were very mindful of honoring their ancestors and would even send people to guard their ancestral tombs. It just happened that a child, not knowing what he was doing, pushed over the gravestone of his ancestral tomb. The tomb guard hurried back and said, "Sir, the gravestone of our ancestral tomb was pushed over by a child!" But he didn’t get angry or hold it against them; instead, he asked urgently, "Which family?" He then went to that family to understand the situation and asked, "Was the child injured?" His first concern was for the child. Speaking of this, we think of Confucius's house catching fire. What was Confucius's first thought? "Were people hurt?" He didn’t focus on material possessions. If the stables caught fire, the horses would probably be gone, which was like losing a luxury car, wouldn't you be distressed? You aren’t distressed? I admire you! Those horses probably cost several years’ worth of salary. So where do we see a person’s cultivation? We see it in how they respond to sudden, unexpected events. It's in whether or not they have any intention of blaming others, but instead are always considering the other person’s perspective.

After Yang Zhu asked, "Were they injured? It's okay, don’t be scared," he told the parents to keep an eye on their child and prevent him from doing dangerous things again to avoid being crushed. I think the parents were both ashamed and touched at that moment. Such a good official, not blaming them at all, but concerned about their child. Yang Zhu didn’t hold it against them. From these examples, we admire him greatly.

One example of his strict self-discipline is that one day, he dreamed that he went into an orchard and picked two pears to eat without permission. When he woke up, he was extremely self-reproachful, saying, "In my dream, I took two pears without permission, which shows that I'm usually not clear about the difference between righteousness and personal gain.” As a result, he didn’t eat for several days to punish himself. He was strict with himself. Now that we’ve heard this story, what does it have to do with us? In the future, if you dream of bad things, having wrong or wicked thoughts, then the next day you should contemplate your mistakes or skip a meal to make a lasting impression on yourself. But don’t fast too severely, or you’ll just dream about being hungry.

From this example, we see that ancient people were very strict in their self-discipline. Why? Because they were very clear that people have thousands of different states of mind throughout the day. If one doesn’t notice a single thought, a single wrong thought will continuously lead to other wrong thoughts. Just like the example we mentioned, not being able to put ourselves in other people’s shoes, and only staring at their faults. This will magnify the issue, and not only magnify it, but then you’ll also tell others, so there will be more and more gossip. Something that was nothing will become something, and small things will become big. So, this wrong mindset and these wrong thoughts have to be stopped, or this anger has to be stopped, or it will be impossible to control.

‘Anger is like fire; if you don’t extinguish it…?’ Hmm, we talked about it last time, ‘…it will spread like wildfire.’ ‘Desire is like water…,’ you haven't memorized it, because you feel like you still have tomorrow to learn. So, taking responsibility is the beginning of growth. When we used to teach at schools, it was like pushing a duck onto a perch; our own foundation wasn't strong enough, but we had to teach every day, so we were forced to improve. Your lives are very peaceful. Perhaps you'll remember these sentences today. Then, when you return home and encounter that very problem, as soon as you speak this line, it will be like a sweet dew or a cooling agent. 'Oh, thank you, I've been enlightened!' If you memorize just this one sentence, your merit will be immeasurable. See, when a person is extremely angry, 'Anger is like fire; if you don’t extinguish it, it will spread like wildfire,’ and you will burn up all your own blessings and the harmony of your family, then he might suddenly calm down. Because in the present age, if people don’t encounter the right circumstances, it’s possible that they’ve been busy for forty or fifty years without ever having learned these good teachings. That’s why when we held some lectures, especially the most memorable thing was seeing those seventy-year-old elders, holding their *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, with tears streaming down their faces. They said, “I'm already over seventy, and I’m just learning now. I must study diligently; I’m starting to learn how to be a person at seventy!” When we Chinese descendants say these words, how heartbroken must our ancestors be? They left these teachings for each generation, but it's been neglected only by the last few generations.

So, we Chinese people in Malaysia must have ambition and a sense of mission. We must establish the Chinese Academy well. Everyone should take note: "The Malaysian Chinese Academy," what does it represent? It means that the Chinese people in Malaysia have to bear this responsibility. Any circumstance has a principal and a supporting role. The principal is the protagonist, the supporting role is the secondary character. So, the protagonist of the Malaysian Chinese Academy are the Chinese people of Malaysia. Don’t think that I'm trying to shirk responsibility; I am not that kind of person. You must believe me. When I am the supporting role, I’ll put in a lot of effort, "Heave-ho, heave-ho," I will put in a lot of effort. But you have to see that the more wholeheartedly the protagonist, the master, puts in effort, the more you can attract Chinese people around the world to join in this great undertaking. If the master is not proactive or does not have a sense of mission, people will come and say, “I don’t think this is going to last, maybe I should think about it first and observe.” In any circumstance, you must understand the relationship between principal and supporting roles. If this circumstance is our responsibility, we should definitely not refuse to bear it. Okay, today when you get home, you may dream, dreaming of having to go on stage to give a lecture. You might suddenly dream of yourself just looking at books, then when you wake up, from that day on, you won’t let a second pass idly or utter an empty word, but work hard. If we have wisdom and knowledge one day earlier, then the people with whom we have a connection, and our students will benefit one day earlier.

The Song Dynasty was an era of scholar-officials, and produced many prime ministers and renowned ministers. We’re familiar with Mr. Fan Zhongyan and Mr. Sima Guang, as well as Han Qi, Fu Bi, Wang Dan, and Wang Zeng; these are all renowned ministers whom we greatly admire. They all demonstrated the saying, “A prime minister’s belly can hold a boat.” Fu Bi and these other renowned ministers were actually taught and nurtured by Fan Zhongyan. Mr. Fan’s greatest contribution was cultivating many pillars of the court, and also establishing free schools. He donated his family’s geomantically auspicious land to build a school. I heard that it's still a famous school now; throughout the dynasties, they say that school has produced over eighty top scholars and hundreds of advanced scholars.

When Fu Bi was young, his magnanimity could already be seen. He didn't hold things against people. One day, someone was scolding him. His friend came and told him, "Hey, he's scolding you." Fu Bi said, "Maybe he's scolding someone else." His friend said, "He's using your name to scold you." Not missing even one character in your name. Fu Bi said, "There are a lot of people with the same name." And he didn't take it to heart. I think that person who was scolding him probably felt embarrassed when he heard others recount the situation, and stopped scolding him. When he saw that the person didn’t hold it against him at all, how could he keep scolding him? So, the reason why people can scold each other is because both parties are getting worked up, and the more they scold, the more excited they get. The reason why people fight is the same; the more they fight, the more excited they get. But if one person strikes and the other person doesn't retaliate, he will have trouble throwing more than a few punches, and will feel embarrassed, and his anger will subside. Our teachers told us that if someone hit him, he never hit back. If the other person’s push was too strong, he would fall on the ground, and then the person couldn’t continue hitting him.

Those who don’t clash with others are most admired by their superiors and leaders. This is because leaders look at the big picture. They know that "Heavenly timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony." So, they will promote those who do not clash with others, those who consider the big picture, and cultivate such people, and give them top performance ratings. So, is not holding things against people a disadvantage? It's not a disadvantage at all. On the contrary, if you don’t clash with others, all onlookers will admire and agree with your way of handling things.

Han Qi, whom I just mentioned, also did not hold things against people. Once, someone gave him a pair of jade cups, which were very precious. He didn’t take advantage of them, and repaid him with a lot of money. Once, when he was entertaining guests, all of whom were government officials, one of the subordinates among the officials accidentally bumped into the table and smashed both jade cups. Everyone knew the value of those jade cups, and all of the guests were dumbfounded. That subordinate was trembling with fear, and knelt down to beg for forgiveness. But Han Qi (who was the Duke of Wei), with a smile on his face, called him up and said, "Don't be so nervous; everything has a lifespan. Today was just the time when these cups were meant to break, and it wasn’t your fault. Come on, get up, let’s eat, let’s drink, it’s nothing.” He had achieved the standard of being kind and generous to others.

Another time, the Duke of Wei was reading a book and may have been writing a letter. The soldier next to him was helping him hold a candle. The soldier, who was a little distracted, accidentally burned his temple with the candle. The Duke of Wei continued with what he was doing, and with just a gesture, put out the fire, and continued to focus on his work. Later, he may have noticed some movement, and looked and saw that the soldier had been replaced. He called over the captain of the soldiers and said, "Why did you change the soldier?" "He just burned the general's temples with the candle, so we replaced him." "Call him back; he already knows how to not burn my temples, and he will hold it well. Hurry up and call him back.” He did not hold it against his subordinates. What was more important was his kindness. This is because he could see that if the soldier were really taken away, what would happen? He would surely be severely punished, so he didn't hold it against him. I think this small incident alone would have boosted the morale of the entire army. Once word of this got out, I think the soldiers would have been crying because they were so moved. Such a good general; they would be willing to follow him to the death. When it comes to war, the key is morale; when they’re united in purpose, morale soars.

So, there's a great saying that goes, “Enlarge your heart, and encompass all things in the world.” There is nothing that cannot be tolerated; it’s impossible to hold things against others. “Make your heart open, and accept the goodness in the world. Make your heart fair, and discuss the matters of the world. Make your heart tranquil, and observe the principles of the world. Make your heart resolute, and respond to the changes in the world.” This passage shows the breadth of mind and magnanimity of how ancient people conducted themselves. "All things are one body; this is called benevolence." Our Confucianism teaches us to enter into the way of benevolence, to care for all things as if they are ourselves; not just people, but all life. This is called benevolence. There is no one in the world who cannot be tolerated, no one who cannot be forgiven, no one who cannot be loved.

We also have to have a humble heart to accept the goodness in the world. For example, someone who has been lecturing for a long time – lecturing and teaching are different; lecturing means giving a lecture on a stage; teaching is what? It's learning together with your students. Moreover, the word “teach” means to set an example with one’s own life, and personally guide others. That's what we call teaching. Giving lectures without guiding students is called lecturing, not teaching. Also, in the past, in private schools, teachers would live with their students. That had a very profound, gradual influence on the students. If someone has been giving lectures for a long time, and isn’t able to absorb and learn from the perspectives of many other lecturers, then their mindset is not broad enough. This is because everyone has strengths in their lecturing, or they have very insightful views that are very beneficial for us to hear. If our lectures don't have any of other people’s strengths, then it's certain that when we are listening to other people's lectures, we haven’t immediately adopted what's valuable from them. So, in the context of the opportunity to promote learning through lecturing, you need to see if you aren't able to appreciate other people, and if you don’t know how to “open your heart and accept the goodness in the world.”

For example, Professor Liu Yuli from the Central Party School, when she talked about how to overcome anger, she spoke very insightfully, using the “Six Tolerances.” These six tolerances are what we heard in Professor Liu’s lectures at the time, and we thought, "Wow, that’s fantastic!" As soon as we heard it, we quickly adopted it, and then we could use it in our future lessons to share with others. Professor Liu is magnanimous, and doesn't claim "all rights reserved." Our teacher said that when you look at a book, you can first check the last page to see if it says “all rights reserved”; if it doesn't, that person has a more generous heart. She said that the “Six Tolerances” are:  counter-tolerance, forgetting-tolerance, forceful-tolerance, observant-tolerance, compassionate-tolerance, and joyful-tolerance. We immediately understood and absorbed these, and could use them to give back to and benefit others.

"Make your heart fair, and discuss the matters of the world." Be calm and reasonable; don't discuss things with blame and criticism, because that is not beneficial for yourself or others. Moreover, in this era, we should be even more forgiving and tolerant, just as the scriptures say, "If our ancestors were not good, and did not know about morality, and there was no one to tell them, then it should not be held against them." These last few generations have not learned these things, so if we criticize them, wouldn't that be harsh? The *Three Character Classic* says, "If people don’t study, they don’t know what is right.” The *Record of Learning* says, "If people don't study, they don't know the Way." If they haven't learned, why would we be harsh to them? What should we do? We should start with ourselves and take the lead, since *we* have studied.

Perhaps someone will say, "He's been studying for five years, and he’s still doing so poorly." It's very easy for people to be fixated on the surface, to see things from the surface. If we put ourselves in their shoes, if someone has been studying for five years and is going backwards, isn’t that really pitiful?  From our own perspective, we think, “He’s been studying for five years; he should be doing well; he shouldn’t be like this.” It’s always from our own perspective. Someone who has been studying for five years and is going backwards has fallen into a trap, fallen into a pit, so, who wants to study and go backwards? Have you ever met anyone who is studying Chinese culture who said, “Oh, I'm so happy, I'm going further backwards the more I study?” Then we should have even more pity for him, because he has a mental issue. No one wants to be like that. Have you met anyone who is cultivating, who is trying to overcome a habit, and has been crying for three or five years, saying, “I really want to change, but I can’t?” Therefore, someone who truly breaks through their own habits would definitely not be harsh towards others, because they know how difficult it is.

Someone who criticizes another person for having a bad temper, it’s guaranteed that their own temper is not much better either. This is because someone who has truly overcome their temper will be able to tolerate others when they are losing their temper, and may even feel compassion for them. Because he has already enjoyed the joy of not being angry, when he sees other people losing their temper, he will feel that they are hurting their minds and bodies, and he will think, "I used to be like that," and he will feel compassion. Someone who has been through it won’t hold things against others, so the reason why other people’s actions can enrage us is because we probably have those same habits inside of us. When we see that others are arrogant, we get angry, and that shows that we are also arrogant. So, other people are our mirrors, and we still need to go back to the mindset of seeing ourselves as the student, and everyone else as our teachers. That way we will not be likely to not observe our own faults when we see other people’s faults.

So, when you see someone who has been studying for a long time becoming further from the Way, we should have even more compassion for them, because they may be more pitiful and more difficult to pull back than someone who hasn't studied at all. Therefore, we need to use even more skillful means. Why? Because someone who has been studying for a long time, everyone will think that they truly understand traditional culture, and if their actions are not proper, they might discredit traditional culture, and then they will have to bear the karmic consequences. So, truly, there isn’t anyone in the world that we should blame. We should tolerate and have compassion for people who make mistakes.

"Make your heart tranquil, and observe the principles of the world." When we cultivate a tranquil heart, if our minds are restless and irritable, we will not be able to understand the intentions and principles of the sages. So even someone who is lecturing externally still needs to constantly adjust their minds and bodies. For example, you go out and lecture for a few days, and then you come back to reflect and diligently apply what you've learned. After a period of time, if you have the right conditions, you can then go back to benefiting others. But if we were to go out and lecture about traditional culture, 365 days out of the year, that would be like an acrobat flying through the air. If someone is running around to so many places every year, and their mind is at peace, I could never do that. That person’s skill would be unbelievable. Generally, we’re still in the midst of learning, so it’s impossible. If we were to become restless, how much could our lectures truly benefit the masses? Then, are we rushing from one event to the next just for the sake of doing so, or are we lecturing in order to benefit others? We need to be very calm about this and not become someone who is rushing from one event to the next.

Sometimes when we are doing things, we forget our original intention. And we need to be very calm, because if we don't cultivate a tranquil heart, then when we have the opportunity to lecture, with hundreds or thousands of people listening, will the applause make us feel intoxicated? “It’s not beauty that intoxicates; it is ourselves. It’s not wine that intoxicates; it is ourselves.” The applause doesn’t intoxicate, but people intoxicate themselves. When the lecture is finished and the people on the stage are very excited and rush to shake your hand, saying, “You are Confucius reincarnated!” When you hear it the first time, you are filled with trepidation, but by the seventh time, you think, “Hmm… it does seem a little like that.” Then it’s over. If we don't have adequate time and space to build a solid foundation, in that circumstance, we will regress and become attached. We must have self-awareness, and we must know how to adjust.

“It is people who propagate the Way,” not that whoever lectures the most propagates the Way. We need to be very calm about this. What is a person who propagates the Way? They are truly practicing and carrying out every principle of the classics. For example, Teacher Hu Xiaolin is very diligent, and when he gives lectures, everyone benefits greatly. How he tames his greed, anger, delusion, and arrogance; he’s truly made breakthroughs in every single one of those areas. When people hear this, they are very moved and in awe, so they emulate him. So, practical cultivation, the true work of cultivating oneself is the most important cornerstone of promoting the proper Dharma and propagating our culture. This is the foundation that allows one to go further and further down this path. Therefore, we must not forget what Zengzi said, "It is people who propagate the Way, not the Way that propagates people.” Everyone's physical strength and their state of learning is different, but we have to be very clear about whether our learning is steady, and whether our learning is continuously improving.

Finally, “Make your heart resolute, and respond to the changes in the world.” A person's resolve, their calmness and composure, is often enhanced during sudden, unexpected events. So, even though we have learned all these scriptures, we still need to go through many trials and tribulations in order to become seasoned and steady. If we don’t have enough experience, sometimes when we are doing things, although we may intellectually understand the principles, we will still panic and become flustered."


Okay, here's the translation, aiming for clarity and capturing the nuances of the original Chinese while maintaining a natural English flow:

**Book Translation**

Therefore, when circumstances ripen, we must bravely take on responsibilities and diligently train ourselves.  As our abilities to handle tasks improve and our experiences broaden, our tolerance for others naturally increases.  Because we've experienced and seen more, we understand that anything can happen, and we should avoid criticism and pettiness.

Alright, we just discussed the second key point of being generous:  not being petty.  The third point, the third major theme, is to be kind and compassionate (厚道). When we think of "kindness (厚)," we think of the earth.  All things receive nourishment from the earth, yet they return their waste to her. She doesn’t get angry; rather, she transforms that waste into nutrients. Likewise, a mother is like the earth. Before the age of three, how much urine and feces did we give our mothers?  Yet, they provided us with deep love and a good education.  The "Dao (道)" in kindness (厚道) is about moral principles and integrity.

So, where do we cultivate kindness? First, it's through "remembering our ancestors and honoring the past, thereby cultivating virtue in the people." If a person is grateful for their ancestors from hundreds or even thousands of years ago, how could they not be grateful for their parents, who are the source of their greatest immediate kindness? And once this sense of gratitude is internalized, it will naturally influence how they approach everything with this sense of gratitude for the past. They'll think, "Ah, all of this we enjoy today is because of the sacrifices of those who came before us." There’s a saying in Hokkien that goes, "When eating fruit, thank the tree; when eating rice, thank the hoe." Meaning that when you eat fruit, you should be thankful to the tree and its spirit. When you eat rice, you should be grateful to the farmer and even to the hoe, because we have rice to eat only because of all these contributions and the tools involved.

Once this sense of respecting the past is internalized, a person will understand to be grateful for everything, realizing that every connection is not easily made. They will even become someone who is grateful to everyone they meet, in all walks of life. When they go out to eat, they will naturally say, “Thank you, you’ve worked hard, it’s so hot,” to the person serving their food. It’s possible that the person will say, “Come, I’ll make you another dish, on the house.” They receive so much respect and acknowledgment, they've formed good connections, and the next time they come back, they will be welcomed with joy and great hospitality.  Of course, it's not about getting a free meal, but rather about a natural and respectful way of being.

So, remembering the past ("慎終追遠"), “Every day’s needs are met through the efforts of a hundred trades.” For the needs of one day, consider how many different industries are serving us; it's perhaps more than a hundred. Do you all agree? When you open your eyes in the morning and wash your face, don’t you need facial cleanser? And don't you need running water? After using the water, you need a cloth to wipe it up, you had to buy that cloth, didn't you?  The bathtub, the sink, these are also manufactured by someone, right? You sit on the toilet in the morning… All these things that you use -  food, clothing, shelter, transportation - how many people are involved? How can people not be grateful? To complain or be critical only diminishes one’s own good fortune. A person who is constantly grateful is the happiest person, they are not at all at a disadvantage. So happiness is actually not that complicated, it’s a matter of a single thought. Transform your demands into gratitude, and you will find happiness.

Kind people cherish connections (惜緣). They recognize connections (知緣), cherish connections (惜緣), and create connections (造緣). Remembering the past (“慎終追遠”) is about gratitude for kindness; cherishing connections (“惜緣”) is about valuing old bonds.  A person who cherishes relationships will not be harsh. For example, at our age now, when we go home for the New Year, seeing old friends, we say, “Ah, we’ve known each other for thirty years!” We’re all very happy when we talk about it.  I was ten years old when I was in sixth grade of elementary school, and those classmates are still old friends even thirty years later. When we recall those days, we remember that we studied together and shared lunches, they would share good food with me. People are very strange; it seems like other people’s food always tastes better. But after we’ve experienced a bit more, we no longer think that way. When we go away to college for a while and don’t eat our parents’ food, when we come back, it’s different. What tastes the best? It’s our mother’s cooking that tastes the best. This is cherishing old bonds. The *Analects* also says, "Do not abandon old friends, then the people will not be ungenerous." Do not dislike old friends, even if they have faults; still wholeheartedly care for them.  In Confucius’ time, one of his friends did not have the best character, but Confucius still did his best to help him. That’s how “do not abandon old friends, then the people will not be ungenerous" - “ungenerous” here means harsh or critical.

Further, where else do we cultivate kindness? "Look at a person's later actions, a prodigal son who turns back is more precious than gold." Kind people will affirm a person’s current state. For instance, if you hear someone say about another, “Ah, you don’t know how he was before,” a kind person would say, “Okay, that’s all in the past, let’s not talk about it.” This is kindness.

Okay, let's conclude this lesson here for today. Thank you all!


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for clarity and accuracy while maintaining the tone and spirit of the original Chinese:

**Lecture 19: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Honoring Relationships and Fulfilling One's Duty, Rejecting Evil and Maintaining Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

In our previous lecture, we discussed the quality of being magnanimous, and that we must continuously strive to improve this virtue in ourselves.  When dealing with people, we should look at the second half of their journey, always believing that they can improve. Not only should we believe this, but if we have the opportunity, we should also lend them a helping hand. We must not harbor prejudices, suspicions, or negative judgments towards others.  Especially for those of us engaged in education, a teacher's trust is a student's motivation, while a teacher's rejection can lead to a student’s discouragement and depression. Confucius is a good role model for us. Zengzi once mentioned the Master’s self-cultivation, saying, "He saw one good deed in a person and forgot their hundreds of wrongdoings." When he saw improvement or acts of kindness, he didn't dwell on the past, but affirmed their present actions.

When a person has made mistakes in the past, but their family, teachers, and those around them do not deny or criticize them, and instead affirm their small virtues, this can awaken their conscience. Imagine someone thinking, "Wow, my wife praised me for even this little good thing, she promotes my virtues while never mentioning my shortcomings. I can't betray her trust." This kind of motivating force comes from one's conscience. Especially in a family, there is a saying, "Do not speak of family scandals." If you spread negative stories about your family, it will eventually reach their ears, creating severe grudges. Instead of talking about the bad, affirm the good. When those words reach family members’ ears, they will be moved. The key is to conceal wrongdoing and praise virtue. Doing so awakens people’s conscience.  "A prodigal son returning home is more precious than gold." When their conscience is truly awakened, they can inspire many others who are lost, because they themselves were encouraged and affirmed. They turn around and give confidence to those who have made similar mistakes.  Don’t underestimate anyone. When they truly turn back, their lives can generate tremendous value and power.

Alright, so, who is the prodigal son that should return home? First of all, which prodigal son has to turn around first? Let's start with ourselves. This turning around has great power. For example, consider our Malaysian students. If you were educated in English and are not fluent in Chinese, is that good or bad? As long as you turn around, it becomes a good thing. If you say, "Okay, I will go to Han Institute, delve deeply into a classic for ten years, and become a sinologist in the future,” the earth will shake, "boom, boom, boom" because your aspiration is so courageous. Why? When you really achieve that, wouldn't everyone who grew up attending Chinese elementary and secondary schools feel a shock?  Even someone who didn't attend Chinese schools can learn so well; they'd say, "Come on, let's study together." You'll be able to inspire so many people.

Some people might say, "I'm already sixty-five years old, is it still okay?" Absolutely!  Sixty-five is great! Because a sixty-five-year-old can do it, wouldn't the young people be motivated?  Isn’t it so?  You don't believe it? If there's a white-haired person sitting in the first row listening to the lecture, people in the back wouldn’t dare to doze off, out of respect. If a sixty-five-year-old truly aspires to become a sinologist, they can live at least another 20 to 30 years; there is plenty of time, so don’t worry. Because inheriting and promoting Chinese culture is a matter of world peace and stability. With such a great aspiration, Heaven will certainly grant them a long life.  We can understand this in theory. Like Confucius, his self-expectation was to inherit the lineage of the Dao. In times of danger, he was fearless, believing he had a mission and could not simply die.

I've shared before about a chairman of a water treatment company who was an expert in the *I Ching* (Book of Changes). When he was planning to come to Malaysia, he consulted the oracle, and it seemed like it wouldn't work out.  He then made a vow, saying, "Even if my business doesn’t succeed, I will bring the highest Chinese water treatment technology to Malaysia to benefit the country." As a result, his business went very smoothly. This one thought of benefiting a nation of people changed his fate.  When I met this chairman, I also told him he had to come out and promote *The Essentials of Governance*, especially focusing on the *I Ching*.  He has worked very hard on it since.  Good, let's encourage each other.  When everyone makes a vow, it is the most perfect arrangement, it is perfect.  Therefore, this "prodigal son" should refer to ourselves. We have neglected the most important mission in this life, which is to inherit Chinese culture, “to continue the lost teachings of the past sages and bring peace to all ages.”

Of course, before people hear about sage education, they are bound to be unclear about principles and make mistakes.  That's why the sages teach us to "tolerate others' faults."  Furthermore, we should be lenient with others' faults and even help to cover them up, and not publicize them.  We should also pay attention to this when interacting with people.  For example, if we are speaking to someone today, and we don't know their past very well, we might say, "Oh, all the politicians these days are corrupt." And perhaps the person is a government official. Or we might say, "Oh, young people these days are reckless and have abortions," and it turns out they also have this issue. They might think, "Does this person know something about me? Are they prejudiced against me?"  Unconsciously, we may create misunderstandings.  So when talking to someone you don’t know well, speak less. Then, wait for them to ask, and then exchange ideas, this way, you will not create these kinds of misunderstandings.  Because if they ask, and you answer, you are discussing the principles, and they won’t be sensitive.  Once you trust each other, and they raise specific things that they’d like to explore, then there is no problem.

Therefore, in dealing with the world, we need to observe the timing and circumstances.  When dealing with people we aren't familiar with, it's better to adopt a calm and measured approach.  And we need to be sensitive.  For example, if you know someone's background, don't talk about things that are taboo for them.  Or if you see that someone has a physical disability, you must be extra respectful and careful, not touching on sensitive topics. Or if you see that someone is not very well dressed, and they might be poor, don't talk about wealth and status. Or if you already know that someone didn't pass an exam, don’t say something like, "Back in my day, the exams were so easy." They might get upset and leave. So, magnanimity is reflected in these instances, in the way we always empathize with others and act according to what is appropriate. 

Of course, there are countless ways to show magnanimity. We'll just discuss the fourth point: Where is it demonstrated?  It's demonstrated in giving gifts, giving red envelopes, and in knowing how to act appropriately during weddings and funerals.  I recall when I was young, my father kept a record of all gift money exchanges. If he gave 2,000 yuan when his daughter got married, when their daughter got married, he'd give 2,200 yuan. He wouldn’t take the slightest advantage, instead always adding a little extra.

Our ancestors, for thousands of years, even emperors, were very generous. When a foreign nation gave us a gift, our emperor would always return a gift that was double in value.  So have you noticed how much people from all over the world liked coming to China?  Because we were very generous. Look at Zheng He's voyages; he brought China's best culture and means for livelihood, offering them selflessly, without claiming an inch of their land. Without this cultural cultivation, all people would have wanted was to seize their lands and loot their manpower and wealth, which would be very unkind. Because our ancestors were kind, even six hundred years after Zheng He's voyages, many people still commemorate him. Therefore, the heart of the people is the heart of Heaven. When people remember them after hundreds of years, the actions they took are in accord with Heaven's virtue of loving life. When Chinese President Xi visited Malaysia recently, he went to Malacca. Malacca was an important stronghold for Zheng He's voyages. There is also the San Bao Temple (Zheng He Temple) there, commemorating his virtuous influence.

Mr. Liao Fan’s uncle and aunt were also very magnanimous people. The thoughtfulness and selflessness we've been discussing were evident in all their dealings. For example, once, his uncle brought a servant to a banquet. The servant lacked self-control and got drunk.  In the end, it was the master who rowed the boat and brought the servant home.  After arriving, he contacted their wife and family, and they helped them to rest. The next morning, his uncle, Mr. Shen Xin-song, slept in late. His wife didn’t understand and said, "I’ve been married to you for so long, and I've never seen you wake up so late, get up quickly." He said, "Those servants haven't gotten up yet, so I won't get up either. Because if I get up first, I'll definitely see them, and they will be embarrassed when they think about what happened yesterday.  I'll wait until they have all gone to work before I get up." He was so thoughtful, he was considerate of others feeling embarrassed, so he stayed in bed, waiting for everyone to leave before getting up.

His aunt was equally magnanimous. One time, a servant accidentally spilled a bowl of a white substance on the table, thinking it was water. It turned out to be wine that had been brewed.  It can take a hundred grains of rice to brew just one drop of wine, so it was quite a waste. She didn’t get angry. Because what was done was done, she didn’t dwell on the past, but reminded him to be careful in the future, and to be clear in his judgment, to not do it again. Another time, when a servant’s child, not understanding, knocked over a dish, breaking it, the servant was about to punish the child.  She immediately stopped him, saying, "Oh, the child didn't do it on purpose, just gently remind him to be careful when walking."

At that time, Mr. Shen’s son was ill.  Mr. Shen was a wealthy landowner who rented out land to farmers. Out of gratitude for his kindness, one of the farmers made a special trip to visit him, coming by boat.  His wife was deeply moved by the farmer’s thoughtfulness. After his arrival, she prepared a sumptuous meal to entertain him, and very warmly, also gave him the money he spent on the boat fare. Because the farmer also brought a gift, she measured the value of the gift and returned a gift that was double the value. Therefore, we can see a person’s magnanimity in gift giving.

Okay, that is all for our discussion about magnanimity. There are many other ways to express magnanimity, but we can learn by analogy. When dealing with situations, we should always consider others. And then, perhaps magnanimity will be expressed in every action.

Next, let's discuss the fourth key point of the importance of self-education: how specifically do we self-educate and demand of ourselves? We should start with “honoring relationships and fulfilling one's duty, rejecting evil and maintaining sincerity.” “No one exists outside of relationships, and no learning exists outside of relationships.”  We should cultivate the five cardinal relationships.  Within these relationships we should always think, “What duty do I still need to fulfill?”  We should only ask whether we ourselves are doing our best, and never demand whether others are doing their duty. Like Emperor Shun, who moved his younger brother through self-reflection, he only asked if he had done his best to fulfill his duty as an elder brother.  He didn't demand anything of his brother, and in this way, he was able to move him.  Because if there are demands and criticisms, then one cannot “reject evil and maintain sincerity.” The thoughts become more and more biased and deviant, and it is impossible to move others with a sincere heart. And with blame, “everyone blames each other, the whole world will fall into chaos,” and things will become more and more complicated.

In ancient times, there was a scholar named Miao Tong. He had five siblings and they all lived together. He was the eldest brother. Later, his younger brothers married and their wives began to discuss splitting the family.  As the elder brother, it was clear that many of his younger brothers' studies, growth, and even their marriages, were inseparable from the diligent care and assistance of the elder brother.  Sometimes, when people encounter certain circumstances, they get carried away and forget these acts of kindness, but they don't really forget. But if, when someone forgets the kindness of others, we immediately say, “How did I treat you five years ago? How did I care for you ten years ago?” how will that person feel when they hear this?  They will feel ashamed. Shame will ultimately lead to discomfort, and then what? Dissatisfaction, resentment, "What’s the big deal?  I didn't force you, it was your choice.” So if you force others to be grateful for your virtues, it will have side effects.  Because truthfully speaking, were we performing these acts of kindness and righteousness to get something in return?  If that thought is very strong, then our sincerity is questionable.  True sincerity is when we don't seek anything in return, this is genuine true feeling.

Therefore, when helping others, you should not seek anything in return. Moreover, you shouldn’t act like you are higher in status, or more virtuous and that others are lower, and simply accepting your kindness. That won’t work either, because it will put them down.  Your siblings also need self-respect; their family situations and blessings are different from yours.  If you say, "Little brother, take this, I have more money, let me help you," they might not be happy about it, they might say, "Forget it, I'll do it myself." But if they are truly struggling, you need to help them without hurting their self-esteem, and you’ll have to be skillful. 

So where does human wisdom come from? It comes from always thinking about others. And if that heart is always maintained, then the right solution will appear. "When a scholar has a firm and unyielding sincere heart, he has the capability to adapt to infinite changes." If a person’s sincere heart does not change, that loving heart will generate wisdom.  Why is it that when we have always wanted the best for others, we still can’t find the best solutions?  It’s because that heart wasn’t maintained. We become impatient, thinking: I have already done so much, why is he so unteachable? Once these thoughts arise, the right approach is gone. You need patience to have a sincere heart; if you are always thoughtful about others, you will find the right solutions. If you see your siblings struggling, and you're afraid to hurt their self-respect, remembering that everyone has their unique personality, then you'll be very skillful. For example, if the child got into college, “Oh, nephew, you did so well!  That’s great! Here, uncle will give you a red envelope.” And you give a generous one. Or, if there is something worth celebrating in the family, you skillfully express your congratulations, and that becomes support for them.  These are skillful means.

As we were talking about Miao Tong, when his brothers and their wives were arguing about dividing the family, in that moment, Miao Tong displayed his self-cultivation. Even though his brothers were all brought up by him, he didn't mention it.  So, when filial piety and brotherly love are truly cultivated, there won’t be any trace of that on one’s mind.  His heart only sees where he has not done enough. A truly filial person, if you praise them, will be extremely humble, saying, "Oh, no, no, I still have so much to improve. There is still so much I’m not doing." Because they don’t feel it is worthy of praise. They feel like it was something natural and proper, why would anyone give praise? When the brothers wanted to divide the family, Miao Tong did not criticize his brothers, but rather, he shut himself in a room, thinking, “Oh, I’m someone who has studied the teachings of the sages, I studied self-cultivation, family management, and how to govern the world. But I can’t even get my own siblings to unite.” He was deeply ashamed, and began hitting himself in repentance. Perhaps this thought of self-reflection, with a sincere heart, touched them, and his younger brothers and their wives felt ashamed. They went to check on their eldest brother, and saw that he was beating himself. They quickly stopped their eldest brother and knelt down to apologize, "Ah, we won't split up the family anymore. We are where we are today thanks to the care of our elder brother." It was because of his self-reflection, that he reunited the family again.

In this story, the scholars wrote a commentary which is truly wisdom for life, saying, “In all the world, there is no principle other than self-blame and self-exertion.” This "there is no other principle" does not mean that only this sentence makes sense and nothing else, but that all principles cannot deviate from this one principle. This principle is the "way of loyalty and reciprocity." Actually, all the teachings of the sages are inseparable from the way of loyalty and reciprocity. Self-blame is loyalty, and self-exertion is reciprocity. That is, in all interactions between people, and in our five cardinal relationships, as long as our hearts are in the right place, we can handle anything well.  Therefore, “inner sage and outer king” means that one's inner self is in accord with the teachings of the sages. The “king” is a good example in the family. “King” represents a model, and that is a model for everyone. Because people admire your self-cultivation. Like Miao Tong, when he encountered this situation, he engaged in self-reflection. The first step was self-reflection. How could the situation have gotten to this? So once the mindset is adjusted, the mindset is the direct cause and his family situation is the indirect effect. Once the mindset is changed, the indirect effect changes in accord with the direct cause. Just like Emperor Shun, who led by example, his heart was upright, and he was able to change the local customs. This indirect effect changed in accordance with his leading by example, and with the intention of this parental official.

"Self-exertion" means that no matter what the situation is, what can I do? What can I contribute? What kind of remedies can I implement? “Self-exertion” also includes examining if there are any problems with my methods, if there is a need to make adjustments. It's about always thinking, “Is my mindset not right? Are my methods not correct?” This is self-exertion, trying one’s best to improve. “There is no other principle,” If this teaching penetrates our hearts, I believe there will be no major problems in the future when handling matters with people. First engage in self-reflection, and ask, where have I gone wrong? Because when one person engages in self-reflection, the entire atmosphere changes, and everyone reflects on themselves. What else can I contribute? This encourages everyone to forget differences and to try their best to perfect and remedy the situation.

Only with self-blame and self-exertion can one reject evil and maintain sincerity.  So, in the field of education, we must “honor our relationships and fulfill our duty.” First, we must never stray away from the three precious spirits of being a person, to play our role as a teacher. And that is, first of all, to “act as a ruler, as a parent, and as a teacher.” A teacher once gave a special lecture on how to embody “ruler, parent, and teacher.” In fact, everyone must embody ruler, parent, and teacher in order to play their roles well in the family and at work. In doing so, one is able to achieve perfection. The reason why a teacher talks about ruler, parent, and teacher is because a lot of parents have said that their children don’t listen, a lot of teachers have said that their children are hard to teach, and a lot of leaders have said that their employees are hard to lead. So a teacher would then speak about the fact that when we are playing the roles of “ruler, parent, and teacher,” we might be focusing only on “ruler” and neglecting “parent” and “teacher,” or focusing on “parent” and neglecting “ruler” and “teacher.” For example, when teaching at school, we might focus only on being a “teacher.” But are we being “rulers” and leading by example?

For example, one middle school had a rule that students couldn’t dye their hair.  They tried to enforce it for a very long time without much success. All the teachers were tired, wondering, why is it so ineffective?  Suddenly, one of them stopped to take a closer look and noticed, "Many of our teachers have dyed hair!" If the teachers have dyed hair and tell the students not to, how can they be convinced?  So, when you are a teacher, you might be too attached to your identity, thinking, “I’m someone who teaches.” But they neglected to be a “ruler,” that you need to lead by example, then your teaching is effective.

Then there is “parent.” If you are not close with the child, how can they trust you? It’s already hard enough if they don't antagonize or conflict with you. If you don't establish a relationship of trust, your strict discipline might lead to misunderstandings.  Therefore, “a gentleman admonishes after trust is established. If there is no trust, then his advice will be interpreted as slander.” Without a relationship of trust, if you are always teaching them, they’ll think you have prejudices against them.

When we look back at our own growth, did we ever think a teacher had prejudices against us? Or did we notice that a lot of students felt that the teachers had prejudices against them? It looks like you all can't remember, so you're very good at letting things go. “All that is past is like yesterday’s death, all that will come is like today’s birth.” Everyone needs to understand this phrase, “All that is past is like yesterday’s death,” means don’t keep it in your heart. But when it is brought up, it becomes very clear where we were right, and where we were wrong. If “all that is past is like yesterday’s death,” and you can't remember anything, it's called forgetfulness. If you often think about it, it is called keeping it in your heart, it's a burden, and you can't let it go. If you usually don’t think about it, but when it’s mentioned you remember, and then you can use that to serve the public, saying, “Ah, my past examples were ridiculous and shameful,” then you can tell your story in detail.

I have tried to provide a translation that is faithful to the original meaning and tone. If you have specific feedback or further requests, please don't hesitate to ask!


Okay, here's my translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and sensitivity to the original meaning, as a professional book translator would approach it:

**Title: The Principles of "Ruler, Parent, and Teacher" in All Roles**

Therefore, with this reminder from our teachers, we can extend the concept: it's not only teachers who should pay attention to the roles of "ruler, parent, and teacher." At home, as a wife, you should also embody "ruler, parent, and teacher." What does "ruler" mean? It means leading by example. "Parent" means cherishing and loving your husband. "Teacher" means seizing every good opportunity to remind him in a way he can accept, offering teachable moments. That is also the role of a "teacher." "A virtuous wife brings few disasters to her husband." If a wife is very skillful in reminding her husband, and even does so with a touch of humor, she may help him avoid a potential calamity.

For instance, if he smokes heavily, severely damaging his health, you could skillfully say, "Oh, our daughter is so adorable. I really hope that on her wedding day, it will be you who walks her down the aisle, you who hands her over to her husband. You absolutely cannot be absent. You need to take good care of your body." Then stop there, and say no more. Don’t say, “Stop smoking!” He’ll just retort, “I won’t!” People sometimes can't control their own minds, and can be especially stubborn. Even if they know what others are saying is correct, they feel uncomfortable, as if they are losing their pride by listening. Thus, you need to know how to speak with discretion, stopping at the right moment. Therefore, if others can't accept our advice, it means we lack the gentleness and wisdom, not that they are at fault.

When we don't receive understanding from others, we need to turn inward and reflect on ourselves. It’s like the particularly insightful passage in *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*: “When parents have faults, we should advise them to change.” Don't forget our initial intention is to help them change, for their own good. We need to “display a pleasant countenance and use gentle words.” This refers to our attitude. “If the advice is not taken, we should try again when they are pleased.” "Pleased" means to find a time and place when they are in a good mood. “If the advice is not taken, we should try again when they are pleased." What is meant by “try again”? It means having patience, trying again and again. "Even if they scold us or are upset, we shouldn't harbor resentment." He might not understand, might even scold us, and we might cry alone in our room. But we should pick ourselves up and come back out again. Why? If we’re still crying, it means "I'm so sad, my ego is not letting go." We should dry our tears and emerge to serve again.

You see, this passage helps us reflect. When we are doing something or advising others, are we paying attention to these aspects? These principles apply universally, and we can embody "ruler, parent, and teacher" no matter what role we play. Can even a community resident practice "ruler, parent, and teacher" to improve the community's atmosphere? Of course. When people focus on how to be a “ruler, parent, and teacher” to others, they won’t focus on other’s faults. Because upon reflection, they’ll realize they have room for improvement themselves, and they’ll hurry to work on those things. Where would there be time to criticize others? You could even turn the tables on what you criticize, thinking, “He litters; I’m not doing well, either. If I pick up trash every day, I will definitely move him.” This shift in thought transforms confusion and recklessness into enlightenment and leading by example.

The practical examples are endless, so let's talk about the spirit of things. "Being a Ruler," first, means embodying the spirit of leading by example. Second, it means having a sense of mission. A leader always guides a group in pursuit of goals and a meaningful life. Therefore, they must have a sense of mission, which will make people feel that following this leader gives them hope. Don’t be a leader who, every time they speak, says, "Ah, life is short. Sigh, life is meaningless." If that happens, the team will be at high risk for depression.

Be positive and proactive. Look at the moral model award. There was a woman named Xu Yuehua. She lost both parents at an early age. When she was twelve, her legs were severed by a train. At eighteen, she was sent to a welfare institution. Soon after she arrived, she told the head of the institution, "I want to come out and take care of children younger than me." The head was shocked. You don’t even have your legs, so you should be taken care of by others, much less take care of others. But she insisted. She started walking with wooden stools. For thirty-seven years, she cared for one hundred and thirty-eight orphans. When you think about it, if that were our life, would we still be smiling? Yet, she was incredibly optimistic and always smiled. Many of the one hundred and thirty-eight children she raised were born with cleft palates or other disabilities, but we could see the same qualities in her children: they were optimistic. This is what it means to lead by example.

She had a very soft heart. One thing she said was particularly memorable. She was able to empathize with the children. She understood that children with birth defects are particularly sensitive, and even a simple action could hurt their feelings. Sometimes when she hugged these children, they would drool, a lot. If their saliva touched her clothes, she would never wipe it off with her hands because she was afraid that doing so would make the child feel bad. This was kindness so deep that even the slightest action was meant to avoid hurting another person.

Those of us who are educators are filled with admiration upon hearing this example. We feel she is our role model. Although she took on the role of a mother, in her optimism, she is a “ruler” and she is also a “teacher.” I believe that if her more than one hundred children came back to see her, she would provide the best guidance. In fact, during one interview, a young woman pushed her forward, and the young woman was also smiling radiantly. Someone asked the young woman, “You grew up in a welfare home, how can you be so optimistic about life?” She answered, "I learned it from my 'mother'."

One characteristic of the “ruler” is also selflessness. This will earn the respect of the group, the whole group will be convinced. If you have selfish motives, the group will be disgruntled. Not just when leading groups, but as parents, with three or five children, you should treat all your children with selflessness.

Furthermore, knowing how to use people's strengths is an important aspect of "being a ruler." If the wrong person is used in a group, the group will suffer great disaster. For example, if you want to hire someone to manage finances, they must have the qualities of integrity and uprightness. If you want to have someone lead a department, their character must be very broad-minded, because “without virtue, one cannot attract followers; without tolerance, one cannot bring peace to others.” If a manager has a narrow mind, there will be great stress in the group or department, and a lot of disputes. If you appoint them to lead a department that’s supposed to be peaceful, it will only cause more problems. It's not their fault, but our own for misusing them. If their talents are best suited for the front lines, and you use them as a general, that's wrong as well.

When a leader misuses someone, they shouldn't blame that person, but instead reflect on themselves. Why? Everyone has their strengths, it's up to us to know how to use them. In our Hokkien dialect, we say, “Even a bad horse has one good kick.” Even the worst horse has at least one skill, it can kick. So use their strength. They will be able to contribute. "Employ their strengths, guide them in overcoming their shortcomings.” To improve them, you need to understand their problems and weaknesses, and patiently guide them, hand in hand, leading them along.

Another very important cultivation aspect for a ruler is to accept criticism, to be able to accept other’s advice. Emperor Taizong of Tang is an excellent example. When people criticized him for his mistakes, he didn’t object. He was very gracious, accepting that he was wrong. This enabled people to advise the emperor without pressure. Sometimes the emperor is, after all, in a position of great authority. If he becomes enraged when his officials give advice, the officials may become apprehensive, and not fully express themselves, which could lead to errors in important decisions that would harm the people. An emperor who is always concerned for the welfare of the people will have the magnanimity to accept criticism and differing opinions.

Of course, in the Five Relationships, we all need to fulfill this duty of giving advice, and we need to cultivate the habit of accepting it. The person giving advice should be calm and not be using it as an excuse to vent their anger, or be highlighting another person’s bad behavior. Therefore, “Criticize in private, praise in public.” We should not criticize someone in front of others. That is not kind. When the person giving advice is calm, and the person accepting the advice is happy and grateful, the family or group will be able to interact with candor. There will be no topic of discussion that they are afraid of discussing. However, if they don’t have that attitude or training, they will not communicate frankly with each other. Instead, they will not speak openly but instead will talk behind each other's backs. It will become a source of ridicule. When you talk behind someone's back, and someone else hears, people will think that this group is not united, but rather, criticizing each other. Won’t this family or group become the laughingstock? So, “Don’t air your family's dirty laundry” is also an important attitude towards life. We have a responsibility to our own family, our own group. How can we still criticize them? Instead of fixing the problems we waste our time telling other people. Doesn’t this show we don't understand what it means to fulfill our duties? If we don’t understand our duties, how can we criticize others? Especially our own people.

Next is the role of “parent,” to provide care and nurturing. Do you think you should nurture your students as a teacher? Yes, when I was a 6th-grade teacher, they would often get hungry, so I would prepare organic cookies for them. When people are growing, they get hungry easily. You might say, "I'm a leader." But, yes, a leader has to as well. After all, people in the group spend 8 or 9 hours a day working with you. You must care about their lives, their meals, and keeping warm. It is also a form of nurturing. For example, when someone is eating ice cream, you should advise them that eating ice cream is very harmful to the body. Don’t just say, "Stop eating ice cream." Adults are very sensitive to losing face, so if you speak to them directly, they will not be happy. Say, "A long time ago, I had a friend who liked to eat ice cream. She was a woman, and she developed some tumors. It was very bad.” You haven't directly spoken to the person eating ice cream. Then, every time they want to buy an ice pop, they will think of the tumors, and they won't eat it. I’m telling everyone, this is not a scare tactic. There is no luck. Why are there so many women's health issues? Many are caused by what we eat. Sickness enters through the mouth; disaster exits from the mouth.

The second trait of "parent" is a high degree of trust. What parents don't trust their children? When a child is learning to walk, they will fall down countless times. Is there any parent who, after seeing their child fall down a hundred times, will say, "Ah, I'll get him a wheelchair to sit in. I don’t think he can do it?” No. The trust they have for them is unwavering. That trust is transmitted to the child: "My child, you can definitely do it!” This kind of encouragement immediately stimulates the child's potential. Especially when they take that first step, the family will jump up and exclaim, “Fantastic!” It's all about a high degree of trust.

I believe the deep level of trust parents have when their child is learning to walk, if it could be applied to teenagers today, we would be able to guide them back. Today, because we have already become parents, we don’t have the same level of trust as we had when our children were one or two years old. Maybe we hold many of our child's faults in our hearts, and when we see them, we get angry. This will not change your child’s heart. You still have to use your sincerity to change them.

Of course, whether parents, leaders, or teachers, they are protecting and guiding our growth. Everyone needs to understand that protection and trust are not in conflict. Don’t think that because the teacher reminds you that you're doing something wrong, that the teacher doesn't trust you. That understanding needs some scrutiny. Because we are not saints, we need to be reminded. So, trust is established through the belief that “saints and sages can be taught and brought to virtue.” But if they can’t see our weaknesses, how can they protect us? How can they guide us? How can they remind us?

This is why, “A doting mother raises a spoiled child!” The affection becomes a kind of emotional coddling, so she can’t truly protect her child. And at times, we place too much emphasis on our own pride, and we become too suspicious. When others remind us of our faults, we immediately become unhappy, thinking, "Ah, they don't trust me." Don’t be like that. We need to be clear-headed and use correct principles to overcome our emotionality. This will attract even more helpful people to support our lives. If people kindly remind us, but we get unhappy, and think, "They don't trust me," they won't dare to remind us again. Why? People don’t like to offend others. Besides parents and teachers, there are very few people who would directly and consistently protect us like this. But if your attitude changes, then many helpful people will appear in your life, “When praised, be fearful; when criticized, be glad. Then honest and upright people will come closer.”

Furthermore, don't give up; never abandon. What parent would abandon their child? Therefore, do not abandon or give up. And do not seek reward. This is the manifestation of a parent's selfless love. Many leaders who have trained a subordinate become unhappy when their subordinate is ungrateful, and leaves. We shouldn’t be angry. Do your best to train them. It’s your duty. Even if they are not with our company, the skills they learn can still benefit society. We should have a broad mind. If they are doing something wrong, they will eventually come to understand, repent, and admire your tolerance and self-cultivation. Wouldn't that be teaching them? If they become ungrateful, and we start asking for favors, or scolding them, we are breaking the bond. It is very unfortunate. Even if we treated them very well in the past, because there is a barrier now, the lessons will not come. Our ancestors reminded us, “Don’t speak ill of others when severing ties.” Justice lies in the heart of the people; there is no need to lose face out of momentary anger.

I suddenly thought of this: When being kind and magnanimous, absolutely do not use harsh language. We can't use harsh language in any of the Five Relationships. For example, especially in this era, people are pitiful. Why? When it comes to how to be a person and how to handle things, they don't know where the standard is, or where the guidelines are. They are very confused. And without good families, schools, or teachers to guide them, their thoughts and ideas are a mixture of good and bad. They can’t make the decisions themselves. There are also negative influences dragging them down. Where can we find them, which students or children will listen to everything their parents or teachers say? There may be one or two out of ten thousand. However, if they can’t make a turn now, but must experience failure, they may come back and ask for your help. Then you must be patient and wait.

But, if they don’t listen, we say, "I'm cutting off the parent-child relationship!" Aren't you closing off their only path of retreat? For parents to say this is not wise. It’s letting emotions take control. If you say this harsh words, when they actually want to turn around, they may remember what you said, and not return. What will happen if they get into big trouble outside? You will be crying, but it will be too late. You must still express love for them. When they come to you, after experiencing hardship, then you have the opportunity to allow them to become more knowledgeable and improve themselves. This applies to all the Five Relationships, not just the parent-child relationship. Especially as we are learning traditional culture, and as leaders, teachers, or parents, to say these words would be letting down our ancestors. We would be setting a bad example.

Next, we have “teacher.” The "teacher" is someone who embodies the transmission of the Way. “A teacher is someone who imparts knowledge, teaches skills, and resolves doubts.” As for this Way, the first thing is, "Of all virtues, filial piety is paramount.” We must teach filial piety. Then grasp the guiding principles and teach the Five Relationships, the Five Constants, the Four Bonds, and the Eight Virtues. Furthermore, be able to take hold of teaching moments, and open people’s wisdom. For example, Confucius would take his students to see flowing water, and he would teach them on the spot: "It passes by like this, never ceasing day and night." Time is like the river, once it is gone, it will never come back. People must cherish time. "An inch of time cannot be bought with an inch of gold."

A teacher must take the cultivation of national and ethnic pillars as their own responsibility, and take the transformation of the human soul as their own duty. Otherwise, being a teacher is a disservice. Because teachers are engineers of the human soul, if we teach content that causes the human soul to degrade, then it is a great sin. I have heard that kindergartens in foreign countries teach competition. This is harmful and misleading! Our ancestors taught courtesy, tolerance, and humility. This is the proper way to be a person. If you believe that the utilitarianism of the West is correct, then you are misleading children’s lives.

There was a father who went to his child's kindergarten graduation ceremony. In order to show off the success of their teaching, the teachers said in front of all the parents, "Everyone, what can we not eat?" The children answered, "We cannot suffer losses." This father had begun to learn traditional culture, and was shocked. Where should he send his child to school? If children are taught from a young age to not suffer losses, and to compete with others, what will happen? When they go to university they will become even worse. They will argue and bicker, and even worse, they will harm others.

There was a student at a prestigious school, jealous of another student's good grades, who poisoned their classmate. Competition, then, becomes conflict, and conflict turns to war. Now the entire world is filled with utilitarianism, leading to wars in many places. If nuclear war breaks out, then it’s all over. This is a dead end. We cannot follow this path. We must follow the path laid out by our ancestors. “The world belongs to everyone.” We must strive for sincerity and harmony. Where is the conflict in that? "Treat all parents as your own, and all children as your own.” “Give way to others throughout your life,” and you will never suffer any losses. The more you give, the more open your mind will become, and the greater your fortune will be.

Let us now consider "fulfilling your duties and maintaining sincerity while eliminating evil." In education, we have another very important idea to consider: the duty of a minister. At school, we may listen to the instructions of the Academic Affairs Director or the principal; we are ministers. For those of us who are teachers, in regards to teaching, Confucius is our ruler, and we are ministers. If we are always in the role of ruler in our class, then won’t our arrogance rise? Yes. When we get home, will we talk to our husbands like they are children, saying, "You stand there, don’t move?" You are fixated on the ruler role and you are not changing. When you get home and see your father, you are a son again. Are there any elementary school teachers who when they see their father, still act like teachers? Yes. It is within this identity that their self-cultivation and character will degrade. "Abiding nowhere while giving rise to your mind." This "abiding" means being attached. When a person is a chairman, they can’t let go of the chairman persona no matter where they are; when a person is a teacher, they cannot let go of the teacher persona. This is how they destroy themselves. They will never be able to improve their practice. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant, and avoid attachment and greed in any situation. We have many roles, and we must always be aware of how we should perform our duties.

We must deeply believe in karma. If the relationship between rulers and ministers is harmonious at school, then the students we teach will understand the relationship between rulers and ministers. If we, as teachers, are constantly criticizing our leaders and government officials, then the children we teach will never understand the relationship between rulers and ministers. The teacher's negative karma will be great. The effects of karma continue, and our mistakes can destroy the child’s attitude towards life.

When fulfilling our duties, there is a saying that many people feel uncomfortable with, because they don't understand its true meaning. “If the father is not a father, the son cannot not be a son; if the ruler is not a ruler, the minister cannot not be a minister.” When people hear this, they feel it is unfair. It is not about comparing fairness on the surface, the point is, if the ruler is not acting like a ruler, he is already wrong. He doesn’t understand. If we, as ministers, also stop acting like ministers, then aren’t we the same as him? Aren't we also degrading ourselves? People need to be rational. In the Five Relationships, if the other person is not being reasonable, or is acting incorrectly, we must still do the right thing. This is a rational attitude to life. And it is by doing what is right that we are able to change the wrong actions of others. The parents of Shun did not do what was right, but as a son, “I must do the right thing.”

**Key Translation Choices & Notes:**

*   **"君、親、師" (Jun, Qin, Shi):** I translated this as "ruler, parent, and teacher" to capture the core concepts while avoiding rigid, hierarchical connotations. I tried to preserve the original meaning with context in mind.
*   **Flexibility and Nuance:** I aimed for a balance between literal accuracy and a natural flow in English, making sure the intent and tone of the original Chinese is preserved.
*   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Certain phrases were rephrased to avoid alienating a Western audience, while still retaining the original wisdom. For example, I translated "歹歹馬也有一步踢" with "Even a bad horse has one good kick" because there is no single, well known equivalent in English.
*   **Consistency:** Terms were translated consistently throughout the text to avoid confusion.
*   **Readability:** The text was broken down into manageable paragraphs, as was necessary to follow the pacing of the original while being more easily digestible by English speakers.

This translation strives to be both accurate and accessible, respecting the cultural and philosophical context of the original Chinese text while making it meaningful for an English-speaking audience. If you have any further requests or need adjustments, please let me know.


Okay, here is a translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for a professional and natural tone suitable for a book:

**Title:**  (This is a speech excerpt, not a complete book, so a title is being created to fit the context) **Cultivating Character and Fulfilling Roles:  Lessons in Humility and Responsibility**

**Translation:**

"Ultimately, didn't even their parents become moved? So these two sentences remind us not to act impulsively, but to rectify ourselves and then influence others. When we ourselves are doing the right things, we will naturally move and transform others, and harmonize the five human relationships. Therefore, if we listen to these words without understanding their deeper meaning, and instead misunderstand them here, it’s a real pity. So, interpreting the text literally, according to our own understanding, the sages would cry injustice!

As a subordinate, one should have four kinds of initiative, and this is also true even as a student. Today, we are teachers, that is a circumstantial identity; it does not mean that we already possess the virtue and knowledge of a teacher. We are still learning. Especially when we stand on the school podium, we are only in recent years beginning to learn about our ancestral culture, so we must also maintain an attitude of a student.  In fact, the spirit of being a child, a student, and a subordinate are all interconnected.

Therefore, within one's role, firstly, there are four types of initiative. The first is to proactively seek guidance. “When in doubt, immediately record it, then consult others and seek clear meaning.”  When you go to any organization, you must consult your leader so that you can familiarize yourself with the work you are to do, the responsibilities you have. Proactively seek guidance; if you don’t understand, proactively ask. Seeking guidance is asking questions.

The second is to proactively report back. What is the progress of your learning? How is the project moving along? You must report, so that the leader can be at ease, knowing that the task assigned to you is not a problem. If you don't report, they will always be worried about it. If a secretary doesn't understand these principles, then the roles of master and servant will be reversed, with the secretary becoming the chairman of the board and the chairman becoming the secretary, with the chairman always chasing up on their tasks.

Proactive reporting also includes whether our understanding of the principles we learn is correct. Sometimes our understanding can go astray. A senior student once shared, “I finally understand that we need to go from seeing others' faults to being able to tolerate them, and then from that tolerance to realize that tolerance is still discrimination, still a sense of superiority, and we shouldn't have such thoughts." We listened to a senior student sharing like this. I said, "You’re wrong. How can tolerance be discrimination? How can it be a sense of superiority? It's not."  Sometimes, in understanding principles, one can be inaccurate or go astray. But if they don't realize it themselves and don't report it, and are not reminded, they might still tell others, and others will admire them, thinking, “Wow, what they said is very correct.”  That would be inappropriate. It’s true, if your tolerant heart has the thought of “I am more cultivated than them,” then you may have a sense of superiority. But you cannot say that tolerance is a sense of superiority or discrimination. That is wrong.

It is like when we had a colleague who, at a time when I was in Beijing sharing with university students, told our colleagues after the lecture, “Teacher Cai, when he gives lectures, he treats everyone below the stage like his own siblings.”  Everyone thought it made sense. I said, "It's not about going up on stage to treat everyone as siblings; we should treat them as such normally…"  When she shared this, everyone was like, "Oh, that’s right!"  What she said wasn't wrong, but it’s important to remember that you shouldn't only remind yourself, 'siblings, siblings' when you go on stage, because then it might come across forced, unnatural. Of course, it is through such reminders that you gradually become more natural, but your state of mind should be like that all the time. If she hadn't spoken up, we wouldn't know how she understood the situation.

The third is to proactively seek instructions. These are all teachings from the *Di Zi Gui* [Standards for Being a Good Student]. Look at proactively reporting back, “When going out, you must inform; when returning, you must greet.”  When we were in elementary school and got home, we would tell our mothers, “Mom, what happened in school today, what did I learn?” Mothers would have a clear understanding of your learning and your relationships with others, and would be able to better guide you. When you are a child, once you get used to this attitude, you will also report back to your teacher about your learning situation, so that your teacher can better guide you.  When you go to an organization, you report the progress of your work; that is “When going out, you must inform; when returning, you must greet.” If you finish dealing with something, you should send a short message, “Leader, this matter has been resolved.” That way, they won’t be worried about it anymore. Nowadays, not many people have this habit. You should think for the leader. Why? Anyone who is responsible will never break their promise. Once you report back, they will be at ease.

The fourth is to seek instructions. “Even if something is small, do not act on your own. If you act on your own, you are failing in your duty.”  Acting presumptuously is extremely inappropriate. At home, you must ask your parents before you do anything; you cannot act on your own. And it is the same at school and at work. And, in fact, what is the final outcome for those who proactively report and seek instructions? "You take care of this matter; this authority is granted to you; you don’t have to report back to me anymore." Because there’s trust, because they are mature.

If you do not develop the habit of reporting back and seeking instructions from a young age, leaders, teachers, and parents will always be worried; now, they are not just worried, their livers are also in suspense, they are anxious about everything. Why? Because we do not have any principles when it comes to doing things, we do not have the concept of responsibility, we don’t play by the rules, and we do not know what new tricks we will come up with. So, when leaders don't trust us much, instead of demanding their trust, we should reflect on why they distrust us. If we are always doing things with the correct attitude, we will definitely earn the trust of our leaders. So, let's reflect: if our parents, teachers, or leaders don't trust us, let's compare ourselves to these four points and see if we are doing them well.

Finally, there is proactive participation. “What parents like, do your best to provide.”  Proactively participate in the family. As long as the parents encourage it, the older brothers and sisters should take the lead. The parents will think of them as the best helpers. In ancient times, and not only in ancient times, but even the previous generation understood that as long as the eldest son and the eldest daughter were brought up well, the five or six younger ones would all follow their example. We also have this hope: In the school, I will be the first to proactively participate in the country's policies, the school's policies, and lead the trend. This intention carries great fortune, because it demonstrates an attitude of being completely devoted, “Examine any family that values loyalty and filial piety, and their descendants will surely prosper.”  Loyalty and filial piety are the great roots of being a person.

Secondly, as a subject to one's ruler or leader, one must also often remind oneself to be focused on the essential things. “Diligence and frugality are the basis of service; etiquette is the basis of managing affairs; obedience is the basis of responsibility.” In Taiwan, we have learned the “Twelve Rules for Youth,” [Twelve Rules for being a Good Youth]. These twelve foundations of being a person are extremely good teachings. Among them, regarding being a subject, we will take these three sentences as examples.  Diligence and frugality.  If a person is not frugal, you can't trust them to handle affairs; they will squander money. Especially in government positions, "The salaries you receive are the product of the people's labor," so you cannot waste public funds. And with diligence, you can truly accomplish things well.

People must also cultivate themselves.  Have you ever experienced a situation where, suddenly, a lot of things all come at once and cannot be avoided?  At this time, you must hold on, stay calm, and train yourself to stay composed and not get anxious in a very busy situation.  In the next class, we will discuss the third focus of “Honoring Relationships and Fulfilling One's Roles,” which is that as a teacher, one must have correct thoughts and viewpoints on how to treat people, how to treat matters, and how to treat things. If we have all these correct viewpoints, it will benefit a child throughout their whole life. "Urgent matters should be handled slowly." When a matter is very urgent, you must slow down, stay calm, otherwise, in your haste, you will make many mistakes. Then you are training yourself so that, no matter how many things there are, you don't get frustrated, and then you are better at managing your time. And not only will you not be frustrated, you will immediately recall a saying: "Heaven will entrust great responsibilities to this person.” When your mind changes, you accept it and it's all good. Usually, we tend to reject or complain when there are too many things, and then time just passes by.  After complaining, people do not dare to work with you, creating obstacles for yourself, obstacles in your mind, and obstacles in your relationships with others.

“Obedience is the basis of responsibility.”  Those who are obedient will actively seek instructions and report back, and only then can you feel at ease letting them take responsibility. For example, if they do not seek instructions and go out with 100,000 soldiers without listening to anyone, what would happen if the whole army is wiped out? Similarly, when you teach a class in school, that class consists of dozens of children, and the responsibility is very great, so you must cooperate with the country’s and the school's policies.

"Etiquette is the basis of managing affairs."  Only then will the boundaries between people remain harmonious.  When you do anything, you must have a certain standard and certain procedures. Doesn’t any ceremony have a set of procedures?  Even eating a meal has procedures. That's how you develop the habit of doing things step-by-step.  This also includes “not intervening in affairs not your responsibility.” That is something we will discuss soon in *Qunshu Zhiyao* [The Essence of Governance from Classical Texts].  That is also about boundaries, the standards of propriety. If it's not your responsibility, and you are interfering in it, it will cause annoyance. If the matter is clearly my responsibility, why are you doing it?  That shows a lack of respect for the rights and duties of others. So, if we divide our work and each person's job responsibilities are clear, it won’t create unnecessary misunderstandings. Also, within etiquette, “Etiquette is nothing more than respect.” In any organization, in any cooperative endeavor, we should maintain an attitude of respect and inform the other party. They will feel respected and they will be happy to cooperate. That meets the spirit of etiquette, "Etiquette is nothing more than respect."

Okay, that's all for today.  Next week, we will discuss the last point, "Honoring Relationships and Fulfilling One's Roles and Having Correct Thoughts to Guide Students, Lead Subordinates, and Guide Our Own Children." Let us explore this together.  That concludes the class, thank you everyone!"

**Lecture 20: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Harmonizing Relationships, Fulfilling Responsibilities, Eliminating Evil, and Preserving Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow learners, good afternoon!

The theme we’ve been discussing in these past few lectures is “Being a Lifelong Benefactor to Children.” When we say “children” in an educational context, we mean our students. For parents, it’s our own children. For a leader, it’s our employees – and we should cherish these employees within our larger family, loving them as our own kin.  Looking beyond that, we should "respect our elders, and extend that respect to the elders of others, love our young, and extend that love to the young of others." With the mindset of our ancestors, all Chinese descendants are part of one great family. At this critical juncture where the continuation of our Chinese culture is at stake, we should shoulder the responsibility for our nation and strive to be lifelong benefactors to all future generations of the Chinese people. Whenever we have the chance, we must share the 5,000 years of wisdom from our ancestors so that they can build upon that foundation and see further. Our ancestors taught us in the classics that we should embrace the world. When we learn well, we can inspire confidence in our Chinese civilization throughout the world, thus benefiting the next generation globally and living up to Professor Toynbee’s expectations for the Chinese people in the 1970s. Professor Toynbee said, “The only solutions to the social problems of the 21st century lie in Confucianism and Mahayana Buddhism.” The only path that can lead the world toward happiness and peace rests on the shoulders of the Chinese people.

Therefore, in considering this topic, the broader our perspective, the more deeply we can absorb the teachings of our ancestors. As the saying goes, “Acceptance of responsibility marks the beginning of growth.” When we remember even just one sentence and understand its meaning, that sentence may change someone’s life. Of course, to change another person’s life, we must first change our own. If we study traditional culture and shed our temper and selfishness, acting selflessly for others, those around us will undoubtedly be deeply moved and very curious. They will wonder, what happened to this person? Then they will see that you are studying the *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child), and the *Qun Shu Zhi Yao* (Essentials of Governing from Ancient Texts). This is called teaching through example. When you change significantly and for the better, you demonstrate its effects for others to see. They’ll gain confidence in Chinese culture, and with that confidence, they will delve deeper into learning it. So the theme of being a lifelong benefactor to children, or to anyone who crosses your path, requires us to first become benefactors to ourselves.

How can we change our destiny? “Transforming habits is the foundation of shaping our life.” If we get rid of our bad habits, our destiny changes.  A person with a bad temper may be fated to encounter a conflict at the age of 43, which ends his life. But if he changes that bad temper, his fate changes, right? If he’s miserly, he won’t have blessings.  If he changes to a habit of giving, his field of blessings will become greater, and his destiny will naturally transform.

To get rid of bad habits, we must engage in continuous self-education. When we notice a wrong mindset, or incorrect behavior, we must correct it decisively.  Therefore, “the importance of self-education” is the seventh major point in our topic. This seventh point is the most important because in educational work, personal example is crucial, and we must be role models. As we mentioned earlier, first, educators must be educated themselves; second, when we recognize our faults, we must acknowledge and repent, and then we must correct them.  We often say, "Okay, I understand, I understand." But we understand for five or ten years, and still don’t change. This is willful wrongdoing, “If we hide faults, we add to our guilt.” Not only does this not change our fate, but it diminishes our blessings. The second point, “correcting faults,” is crucial. Why does it diminish our blessings? Because we are wasting the teachings of our teachers and squandering the precious treasures that the sages left us! How can we not lose blessings doing this? Who are blessed? Those who listen to their parents are blessed. Who loses blessings? Those who disobey and go against their parents lose blessings. Fortune and misfortune lie in a single thought or mindset.

Third, when we want to correct our faults, we must grasp the key principles. But before correcting, we must first cultivate the "three minds": First, a sense of shame. We should feel ashamed that others can strive to become sages, while we continue to fall into degradation. To "place oneself among the ranks of the great sages of the past" is ambition. For example, when Wen Tianxiang visited the Confucian Temple, he saw the great Confucian scholars of the past like Ouyang Xiu and Sima Guang, men who had left their mark on history. As a young man, he aspired to be like them. Thus, Wen Tianxiang left us the famous lines, "Since ancient times, no one can escape death, I will leave my loyal heart to shine in the annals of history." Those with great accomplishments are people who made early aspirations. “Placing oneself among the ranks of the great sages of the past, and not willing to be someone who goes with the flow.”  That tide of going with the flow is powerful, especially in our materialistic society. We must truly cherish ourselves, control ourselves, and achieve something worthwhile. Life should not be a wasted journey. To achieve something meaningful and have purpose, our aspiration and resolve become the driving force for correction, an inexhaustible source of motivation, and the beginning of shame.

Then, a sense of awe, a feeling of reverence. Why? Because good actions are rewarded with good outcomes, and bad actions are rewarded with bad outcomes. A person who understands this should hurry to correct their faults. The greatest sins can be repented, like bringing a lamp into a room that has been dark for a thousand years - the darkness will immediately be dispelled. But if we are unwilling to change, we may not have another chance when our life ends. Apart from our own downfall, we might bring misfortune to our descendants. As the saying goes, "The family that accumulates bad deeds will inevitably have lingering calamities."  We’ve seen many examples of this throughout history. When Dong Zhuo created chaos in the government, he was executed, and even his 90-year-old mother was taken to the execution grounds, and his entire family was wiped out. So, we must have reverence. We can’t indulge our desires, be unrestrained, and must have reverence for the truth, for heaven and earth, and for the divine. With such awareness, even bad thoughts shouldn’t arise. As the saying goes, "One deed can bring disaster to our descendants." This refers to any act that brings harm. "One word can injure the harmony of heaven and earth." This is a lack of verbal virtue. Our elders often said, “We must accumulate verbal virtue," and speak kindly to others.  Even a wrong thought is a seed, and a seed of evil will lead to negative consequences in the future.

As an example, a scholar had vast knowledge, but no matter how he tried, he couldn’t achieve success. Later, he met a wise person who reminded him, “Though your scholarship is great, your blessings have been severely diminished.” A person needs both scholarship and the blessings of destiny to achieve success. Financial generosity brings financial blessings, but one must still have the blessings to receive. The wise person pointed out that in his youth, he angrily glared at his father, which “had diminished a great blessing in your life.” Just the arising of a hateful thought reduced his potential for success! This demonstrates the immense power of our thoughts.

If you have good thoughts, as Mr. Wei Zhongda in the *Liao Fan Si Xun* (The Four Lessons of Liao Fan) demonstrated, “A single thought of yours is for the welfare of the people.” This is a thought for the well-being of the entire nation, and that thought was so powerful that it exceeded the negative acts he had committed before the age of 40. Today in China, President Xi Jinping speaks of “positive energy,” and that energy is immense. Having thoughts that would harm the people is terrible; the negative energy can be extremely destructive, and may impact your descendants. When we understand these principles, a sense of reverence can arise and we will not dare to have bad thoughts. This is called “controlling our thoughts to become saints.” If we control our bad thoughts, and each thought is righteous, then we can approach the realm of the sages.

So, we must develop a sense of shame, a sense of reverence, and a sense of courage. When we discover our faults, we must correct them decisively.  A major fault is like being bitten by a poisonous snake, where you would immediately cut off the limb to save your life. A minor fault is like getting a splinter, which we quickly remove. This is about the second key element of self-education, which is correcting faults.

The third element is “being strict with oneself and lenient with others,” which captures the key points for correcting faults. How do we correct ourselves? We must be strict with ourselves. How do we deal with others? We must be lenient with others. Grasping this principle, the specific point of action is the fourth point that we discussed last time: “Harmonizing relationships, fulfilling responsibilities, eliminating evil, and preserving sincerity.” We must fulfill our responsibilities in nurturing harmonious relationships while simultaneously elevating our own character. When we eliminate evil and preserve sincerity, we continuously transform evil into good, delusion into wisdom, and then we can control our thoughts to become sages.

To “harmonize relationships,” the word "harmonize" means to be at peace and in agreement.  In the past, we saw a thousand people living together harmoniously. Nowadays, with just three people, there might be several arguments a day, with each person finding fault with others. It’s difficult to harmonize with others this way, and even more impossible to fulfill our responsibilities. In such family situations, parents are constantly worried, and it's as if their hearts are in their throats. When we still make our parents worry, our filial piety is clearly lacking. “Injuring the body causes parental worry; damaging virtue causes parental shame.” We should be aware of any behaviors or character traits that still worry our parents, and work to change them, otherwise their worries will never cease. For example, greed can lead to breaking the law. Arrogance can lead to conflicts. A bad temper can lead to trouble. These are things that worry our parents. Even the habit of drinking can cause parents anxiety. Alcohol can lead to loss of control and safety issues. Even worse is gambling, which can cause suffering for the entire family. We must eliminate these things immediately.

Fulfilling one’s responsibilities is not easy. We must always carefully examine our hearts. Are our thoughts veering off course? One misstep can lead to huge differences. As an example, within a family or group, “if we each blame ourselves, we will find peace; but if we each blame others, we will find chaos.” The difference is just a thought, but the difference is huge. Therefore, we must eliminate evil and preserve sincerity. Preserve genuine sincerity and preserve a reflective heart.

Therefore, from the outset, we begin by “harmonizing relationships, fulfilling responsibilities, eliminating evil, and preserving sincerity.”  We should always remind ourselves to embody the spirit of “ruler, parent, and teacher” in fulfilling every responsibility. Because if we want to fulfill our roles, we must do so in the spirit of the “ruler, parent, and teacher.”  In traditional culture and traditional families, emphasis was placed on ancestral worship. “Remembering our ancestors, with the people’s virtue return to being deep and thick.” Those who don’t forget their roots don’t lose their dignity. Forgetting one’s roots is a degradation of dignity, and their behavior might even be worse than an animal. Even crows know to feed their parents, and lambs know to kneel to be nursed. How can human beings, who belong to the “heaven, earth, and human” triad, be ungrateful?

In traditional extended families, the main hall was often the ancestral hall, where the ancestors were honored.  Ancestral sacrifices were performed during spring and autumn, as well as on important holidays. It was also used as a classroom to educate descendants. This had a good effect. Learning in front of the ancestral spirits, students didn’t dare to fall asleep, or be inattentive, and they didn’t dare to disrespect the teacher. When I first came to Malaysia, the classroom was also an ancestral hall, at the Chen clan hall in Kuala Lumpur, which made me feel as if I had lost half a kilo due to nervousness.  The Chen clan were descendants of Emperor Shun, like the Hu clan and others. Thinking about being in front of the descendants of Emperor Shun, I dared not be careless and tried my best to establish this connection. I felt very different teaching in the ancestral hall. Because our ancestors are always watching out for future generations.  Our ancestors were incredibly wise and had boundless compassion, thinking about their descendants five thousand years into the future. Five thousand years later, we can still learn from their teachings. Other cultures do not have that blessing.

In the center of the ancestral hall, there’s an altar with the words “Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parent, Teacher.” We still see this altar in Yunnan. Heaven and Earth nurture all things; without them, we would not have life. We must be grateful to Heaven and Earth. Then, in our lives, those who bestow the greatest kindness on us are the ruler, parents, and teachers. The ruler governs and brings stability, allowing all industries to thrive. Otherwise, when wars break out in so many countries, we would witness the great suffering of the people, and people become displaced and families torn apart.  In Malaysia, the older generation may have experienced wars, and they likely lived through the Japanese occupation. The fear and terror that they must have felt is unimaginable. These are the experiences of elders we know well. When we truly understand this, we should appreciate the kindness of the country and fulfill our responsibilities in every industry, allowing society to develop and remain stable, and repay this national kindness. We must not forget the kindness of our ruler and country.  "Parent": our parents gave us life, and raised and educated us.  "Teacher": our teachers educate us, allowing us to understand propriety and principles of conduct. Without education, our actions might stray away from these moral principles, and our actions would likely hurt the hearts of our parents and relatives. Therefore, we must not forget the kindness of our parents, and we must not forget the kindness of our teachers.  This is the meaning of "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parent, Teacher.”

The "ruler, parent, and teacher" can be considered the three treasures of how we should treat others and deal with affairs in our lives. The “ruler” as we discussed in the last session, embodies the spirit of being a role model, having a sense of mission, being selfless, knowing how to delegate, and accepting advice.  “Parents” have a spirit of nurturing, with great trust, giving without asking for anything in return, and never abandoning. “Teachers” have the spirit of enlightening wisdom, carrying on the traditions, and cultivating the pillars of the nation. When we grasp these spirits, we can succeed in any role.

These three spirits require us to demand of ourselves, not others, because nowadays people have many worries. What are these worries? For example, parents worry about their disobedient children, teachers worry about their difficult students, and leaders worry about their unmanageable subordinates. Do we have these worries? Do we want to get rid of them? Traditional culture teaches us to “turn our worries into wisdom.”  Sometimes the most painful thing in our lives can transform into the most joyous thing if we change our perspective.  It is important to change our thinking.  It is true that when two people face the same situation, one might feel like they’re in hell while the other feels like they’re in heaven. It’s clearly the same thing, so why do they have different feelings? As the saying goes, “Circumstances are neither good nor bad; it is the mind that creates our experiences.” Differences in experiences arise from the attachments, distinctions, and preferences within our minds.

Our center’s CEO, Mr. Wu, gave a lecture on the 15th to the Malaysian public, discussing “The Practical Application of the *Qun Shu Zhi Yao* in Business.” I think everyone was deeply impressed. Mr. Wu shared that when he encounters difficulties, he becomes more excited because it means another opportunity for growth in his life, and the more difficult the problem, the more people he can help after he overcomes it.

The Suzhou government had a very thorny problem that they couldn’t resolve for a long time.  Later, the government approached Mr. Wu and he took only three weeks to resolve the issue, to everyone's satisfaction. Why was he able to resolve it? “The expert sees the details; the novice sees the show.” We hear that it was resolved, and we clap our hands, but we do not understand the mindset that allowed him to resolve it, or the methods he used. In Mr. Wu’s sharing, he emphasized that “When the mind arises, all phenomena arise.” Where do the methods come from? They come from the mind, and that mind is selfless and aims to benefit others.  When they sense that, people realize “you’re always thinking of me, and you have nothing to gain.”  People are moved, and become willing to communicate. Who wants conflict and opposition that cannot be resolved after years? Have you ever seen someone who was in litigation for five years, spent a lot of money and went to court constantly, say "I'm so happy, I've been going to court for five years"? That person has a mental problem. Everyone wants to resolve issues. Therefore, that selfless mindset moves others, and “Sincerity will open even metal and stone.” First, what is opened? The knot in the other person’s heart opens.  Then, with the right methods, mutual understanding and compromise, the situation can be resolved.

When discussing the “ruler, parent, and teacher,” I felt that our CEO, Mr. Wu, has embodied these ideals in a very real, concrete way. He has deeply inspired us. As a "ruler", he acts as a role model. He starts work early, at 5 or 6 AM, and works until midnight. He once forgot to use the restroom, going more than ten hours without it. I felt pained when I heard it. We still have to use the restroom, otherwise, it can hurt the body.  Our two leaders, the CEO and our Consultant Mr. Kang, have worked like this every day since the first day. I said to the CEO that I’d once heard him speak, and that two sentences stuck with me: he said, “The highest quality of being is selflessness” – forgetting oneself and thinking about others and society, “and the highest quality of work is forgetting oneself” - forgetting oneself. Seeing that they’d been working all day, more than ten hours without tiring, made me feel embarrassed when I wanted to yawn. This is acting as a role model, like a “ruler," and he also fully listens to our advice, which is like “accepting criticism.”

As a “parent,” these past few days, the CEO has been having lunch and dinner with all of our colleagues, showing concern for our health, learning, and work. This is nurturing and loving.  Last night, one of our colleagues had high blood pressure, and although he had recovered by last night, the CEO took us all to his room to visit him. This is demonstrating the spirit of a "parent".

As a “teacher," he guides us step-by-step.  When he teaches us, and when he eats lunch or dinner with us, he sometimes talks to us for two hours after dinner, individually answering every colleague’s questions. This is instruction through life experiences.  One thing that he said really stood out. The most impressive thing about our CEO’s application of traditional culture is his emphasis on “family culture.”  He does not require his more than two thousand employees to clock in. He says, "Who would clock in when they're at home?" He emphasizes the spirit of family, and his more than two thousand employees are very united. When employees are pregnant, they get special care; they can come an hour later, or leave an hour earlier, and they are at special tables for meal times, and they are given extra food.  Because when an employee is pregnant, that child is the next generation of this big family.

This “family culture” is indeed the core of Chinese culture.  Around the time of the Second World War, Western scientists researched the question: “Why is it that the civilization of the Chinese people is the only one remaining among all the world’s civilizations? Why is it so enduring, lasting for 5000 years? What factors have contributed to this achievement?" Their research concluded that the key was the emphasis that the Chinese people place on family education. This tells us that the tradition of civilization is transmitted through “family.” This isn’t the three or four-person family of today, but rather families of two to three hundred, or even five to six hundred people. That is why “regulating one’s family allows one to govern a state.” If you can manage hundreds of people and be harmonious, you can also handle any situations, and gain wisdom for handling affairs, and a broader mind.

Our nation is facing a huge transition, with extended families disappearing.  How can we then transmit our culture?  With urbanization, the quality of our next generation is declining rapidly. Why? How can two-generation families teach filial piety, or how to interact with people, or how to conduct oneself? And when the child is an only child, how do you prevent spoiling him? It is difficult to pass down traditional values with small nuclear families. If we do not transmit our traditions, our next generation will rapidly degenerate! A Chinese person in Hong Kong lamented that a nation with 5000 years of civilization, why has it become one of the most shortsighted nations in only a few decades? This is something that we deeply relate to. When we open the newspaper, we see examples of young people harming their parents and grandparents for the sake of only a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, and it’s no longer newsworthy. Our ancestors in heaven must be weeping to see this. They gave us such profound teachings, and yet we do not learn them.  Instead, we learn to be selfish, and compete and fight with others. That is how we have reached this point. This is the reality that we are facing, and it's getting worse. The crime rate of young people is increasing. Because we have witnessed this phenomenon, we have a responsibility and moral obligation to improve the situation. We should show courage when we see injustice.

Teachers with great wisdom have recognized that most families are small nowadays, so how can we continue to transmit the culture?  They have proposed that we view corporations as “families.”  A corporate organization is a big family. In the past, the extended family was held together by blood relations. The corporate family is held together by shared values, ethics, and a sense of righteousness.

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow, while also retaining the spirit and nuances of the original text.

**Translation:**

This is something Japan actually did very well, but it's also becoming weaker now. This is because it requires constant education, otherwise, even good traditions are hard to maintain. Japan was the first in Asia to embrace utilitarianism, and now their filial piety and ethical morality have declined significantly. They have established companies that employees stay with their entire careers, never changing jobs. Their lives, housing, and even the next generation are all well taken care of, so people’s hearts are at peace and they dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to their organizations. This is based on benevolence and righteousness, not blood ties.

Our CEO, after hearing this, implemented this "family culture" in his own company. As a result, thousands of companies came to observe and learn from their experiences. We shouldn't underestimate the impact that a group or company has on the entire nation and society; that power is enormous. After being exposed to it, thousands of companies are implementing this "family culture," and the impact is far-reaching. Now even Japan and Korea are following suit. He has also been invited to Japan and Korea. This time, a business forum, themed around the management philosophy of Kazuo Inamori (the "Saint of Management" in Japan), also invited our CEO to give a lecture, where he solved many problems that the guests couldn’t resolve.

Why could he answer these questions? Because he himself has been doing it for so long. His company has been around for over twenty years, and he truly puts into practice the principles of respecting the sovereign, parents, and teachers. So how could there be any question he can't answer? If he actually does it, he can surely articulate it; what can be articulated may not always be achievable. Sometimes words are just theory. We need to integrate understanding with action and knowledge with practice to truly internalize it. Our CEO has truly implemented it himself. When he talks about "family culture," it feels like a profound awakening, especially when he pinpoints the most essential core. That core, he points out, is the "teacher" in the concept of "sovereign, parent, and teacher." He not only seizes the opportunity but also hits the most crucial points. And what are those core points? "If there is 'self,' there is no family culture." This is a classic statement.

I ask everyone, when you hear the words "family culture," what is your first thought? It gives me warmth. But if everyone wants warmth, who will go and chop the firewood? If everyone thinks of "me, me, me" first, that's selfishness. How can that be a family culture? This reminds us of our teachers' teachings. Chinese education aims for two goals. The first is to ensure that a person's natural "affection between father and son" is maintained throughout their life – that is, filial piety. If this filial piety is maintained throughout life, will their hearts be full of just their parents, and how could they possibly be selfish? From this core of filial piety, this original point of love, the second goal extends. From loving parents, it extends to loving siblings, family, neighbors, communities, society, the nation, and finally to loving all people of different races and religions in the world. One day, a senior fellow shared that his mother got along very well with people of all religions because she had the foundation of filial piety. Furthermore, she loved even beggars and did not look down upon anyone. So, this extension of love applied to all religions. When he was young, he would go with his mother to pray in mosques, Catholic churches – everywhere – with respect.

The two goals achieved by the teachings of our ancestors were to maintain the love of parents throughout life and to extend this love to all people, even to all living things, and to cherish all objects. Not wasting things, being frugal, and cherishing blessings – all these stem from the education of love. Therefore, if it's a family tradition where love flows from parents to family, then there’s no room for self-interest, which is the only way to foster a true family culture. How can there be a family culture if everyone is thinking only of themselves? Isn’t that just fighting and snatching? I believe that if you, especially the senior fellows from Malaysia – many of whom used to haul manure and help their parents 30 years ago – if you can share your parents’ burden, you are guaranteed to have blessings in your later years! If you observe carefully, the truth is right around you. How can there not be blessings for someone who constantly cares for their parents?

Look around calmly. For example, if there are seven or eight siblings, the first few are very hardworking, while the last ones enjoy a better life. However, after 30 years, the wheel of fortune turns. The older siblings still remain sensible and are blessed in their later years, while the younger ones who enjoyed things from a young age, wanted ties and nice clothes, and whose children also like to spend money, do not have it so good in their later years. Therefore, our ancestors' saying that "the wheel of fortune turns every 30 years" holds true. Are there any families that have been wealthy for three generations? Yes, but that is because they have a family tradition of wisdom – the tradition of thrift and diligence. If people like to spend money, and the next generation surpasses the previous in their spending habits, I can guarantee you that your family's wealth will not last past the third generation; there are no exceptions. Don't fight against the truth. So who is blessed? It’s those who listen to the truth, listen to their ancestors, and listen to their parents – they will not fail. This applies to families and to dynasties as well. Why was the Qing Dynasty prosperous? Because the first few emperors strictly adhered to their ancestors' teachings. Those who didn't, caused the dynasty to weaken.

Therefore, the first point our CEO made was that a family culture must begin with “no self,” thinking of parents and family first. This is the core spirit of our large families for thousands of years. My father, being the eldest son and grandson, had a relatively smooth career. This was truly a blessing from our ancestors. Due to his traditional cultural upbringing, his life was one of "righteousness." He never considered himself first. I never saw my father’s thinking being self-centered. He did his best to love and care for his parents, siblings, and friends. And where are the blessings for the Chinese in Malaysia? It's in their dedication to their loved ones back in the mainland. This is so precious. Even if they have little for themselves, they cannot let their relatives back home go without. This is a life of righteousness. Therefore, Malaysia experiences very few natural disasters; it seems they’ve never encountered an earthquake. These are all the results of blessings, including the presence of the Chinese Academy in Malaysia. I'm not jealous; I’m supportive, and we will do our best to support it. To learn traditional culture, one must become a sensible person. Why is it in Malaysia? Because Malaysians of Chinese descent truly cherish their ancestors' teachings; where there is feeling, there is a response.

The first point of "family culture" is to be selfless. Only by not being selfish can a family culture be built. Second, there are no secrets in family management. There’s nothing that family members cannot talk about; we should communicate openly and honestly. We felt this when we spent time with our CEO. We would bring up certain situations, and he would try to fully understand and then immediately help resolve the issues. Third, we must love everyone equally. There should be no favoritism. This is very important. The fourth point is to emphasize diligence and frugality in managing the household. These are all vital aspects of family culture. Without frugality, the family will decline.

Our CEO seizes every opportunity to act out the "teacher" in the "sovereign, parent, and teacher" model – to give educational opportunities. Seeing our colleagues in the classroom wearing thick clothes and shawls, the CEO said, “First of all, I am not showing respect to this colleague, letting them be so cold.” He emphasized, "We must always maintain a respectful heart towards people, things, and events. We shouldn't waste even a single resource on Earth." His company's efforts to save electricity have been very effective, reducing their operating costs substantially. They have also had "low carbon" meals three days a week, eating vegetarian food. The money they've saved over the years, the number of trees they have saved from being cut down, is immeasurable. This is all a manifestation of respect.

Furthermore, we must always have a joyful heart and a grateful heart. Where does this gratitude, joy, and respect come from? Any time (everyone, review), anywhere. It must be in every detail. Why? Because every word and action is a reflection of the heart. We can talk big, but whether we’ve truly implemented it is revealed in the details. The fact that the air conditioning is too cold is not only disrespectful to the attendees but also disrespectful to the general public, whose support our center enjoys. And that’s also disrespectful to the teachings of the sages, which teach us to be thrifty. Okay, is the air conditioning okay today? Our team should be mindful and adjust it if it's too cold or too hot. Later, we will discuss the correct values. The concept of "sovereign, parent, and teacher" must also have the correct values. Values determine all our words and actions. In those correct values, we must consider our attitude towards people, events, and things. When dealing with situations, we can’t go to extremes; it shouldn’t be too cold or too hot. We can’t have people fainting from the heat. There's a saying: "The void embraces all; appropriateness is key." In everything we do, we must strive for balance. Later, we will discuss how to find that balance, following the "Middle Path.”

This is how the concept of respect is realized in every detail. Our CEO also said, “Why take the elevator from the second floor to the third?” Every time you start the elevator, it uses a lot of electricity. Instead, try to take the stairs. The amount of electricity you save is immense. Furthermore, you save the Earth’s resources and also get some exercise, which benefits your health. This shows that helping others ultimately benefits yourself.

This is our sharing on “acting as sovereign, acting as a parent, and acting as a teacher.” We also experienced profound learning from the actions of our center’s CEO. We are grateful for the virtuous power of our teachers and for the wisdom of Uncle Lu, who had the insight to recommend that we invite the CEO to lead our center. We are also grateful to our ancestors for their blessings from heaven. We also thank all of you senior fellows. It is because of your blessings that our center has been able to receive the support and care of our CEO and Consultant Kang.

Secondly, “to uphold proper relationships and fulfill one’s duties while avoiding evil and maintaining sincerity.” This second major point involves our work roles, including teaching. A teacher has the attention of the whole class. We could say they are the king or leader of that class. But from another angle, the principal is the teacher's leader. People play many changing roles. What is a company director when he is in front of his mother? He is her son. If he is not in the right mindset, and is still acting like the company director in front of his mother, he is sure to be reprimanded by her. She will even tremble when she sees him. If he is arrogant, or even if he makes more money and puts pressure on his mother, that is not right.

Therefore, people must be highly vigilant. We should have genuine hearts, filial hearts, and good hearts that arise without any attachment. This "attachment" is the point where you become fixated on something. For example, people can become fixated on their academic credentials. "I have a master's degree," or "I have a Ph.D." The more they cling to that, the more their arrogance grows. Or people make a lot of money and start to walk differently, looking down on others. This is being "attached" to having wealth. Or when someone has thick, black hair, they might be fixated on it. When they see someone with grey hair, they brag about their own hair. That is them clinging to the appearance of their hair, and that will lead to them showing off and putting others down. We must love ourselves, but what does it mean to love oneself? It means not clinging to things, not allowing oneself to be tainted. We came to this world pure and should leave the same way. "Originally, there is nothing; where can dust settle?"

The truth is that when someone is greedy and thinks too highly of themselves, life becomes very tiresome. What is there to gain? Because you believe you have something, you constantly need others to affirm you, praise you, and respect you. If others don't give you that, aren't you sad and angry? Yes, aren't you just making trouble for yourself and causing yourself pain? Our ancestors remind us that we are "asking for trouble," "getting what we deserve," and "digging our own graves." Now think about the rest for yourselves. These sayings from our ancestors are meant to enlighten us. All of our obstacles and frustrations are caused by our own hearts. Don’t blame others. Like we’ve shared, our CEO becomes more excited when he faces difficulties. How can there be any obstacles for him? You've all attended these classes, so have you encountered difficulties in the past two days? Are you getting more and more excited – "I'm going to grow again! I'm going to break through!" – or are you like deflated balloons? So when reading scriptures and attending classes, what's the most important thing? It is to allow these teachings to penetrate our hearts, becoming our very souls and attitudes, which will be of immense benefit.

Therefore, we must not let our life experiences lead to the development of negative habits or attitudes like greed, anger, ignorance, or arrogance. Instead, we should use each opportunity to continuously improve our virtues. When I teach children, the more I teach, the greater my sense of purpose and compassion become. That’s correct. If you teach and your temper worsens, then that’s wrong. If, as a director, you increasingly feel a sense of life’s mission and teach many ignorant employees to become filial, then your virtue and wisdom are improving. However, many directors become more and more obsessed with power, and that means they are falling.

A teacher is the teacher of their class. But in another role, they are subordinates led by the principal. We are also subjects. The emperors of the past understood this very well. They were "the nine-five sovereign" – the greatest in the entire country. But if a person is always in the role of sovereign, would their mentality become skewed? Yes, they would become increasingly arrogant, thinking everyone has to listen to them. As the “Son of Heaven,” they are sons of the heavens. Who do they answer to? They are accountable to the heavens. So, from the perspective of the heavens, they are subjects, and the heavens are sovereign. Whenever a natural disaster occurred, the emperor would say, "I have done wrong.” He would go to the Altar of Heaven to confess his sins. He was also a subject. By constantly reminding ourselves that we are subjects, we become humble and self-restrained. When people keep climbing higher, they also need to frequently reset themselves, or they will become arrogant. Why do we say “early success is a great misfortune?” Because they will feel high above others and will never be able to come down.

Okay, the duty of a subject, last time we discussed the four types of initiative. A teacher or principal, are they not also subjects? When facing education officials, they are subjects. Therefore, those who are in a position of power are also subjects. If a teacher performs their duties as a subject very well, I guarantee that the children they teach will become loyal citizens. If a teacher frequently criticizes the principal or other leaders, their students will likely cause problems after they enter society, because they will be rebellious and refuse to obey leadership. It is regrettable that many prestigious schools, which receive the most funding from the state, cause one to reflect because many of their students do not return to their country after studying abroad and even speak ill of their own nation. This is because teachers in those schools may be criticizing leaders and the nation itself, and this of course will produce those results. This is a very serious mistake. Those who receive the greatest support from the country should be the most patriotic, not the opposite. This is not right.

So, setting an example is important. In fact, students are simple, even university students are simple. Besides my own personal experience, I felt I was very simple in middle school. Can you tell? After reading "The Three Principles of the People," the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I personally went to read "The Biography of Dr. Sun Yat-sen." In middle school, I cried so hard because I realized that it took so much sacrifice for a country to be built; that it was not easy for a nation and society to be stable! So, in middle school, I felt very simple. Even when I lecture at many universities in Beijing, the students listen with rapt attention. If they were not simple, how could they listen so attentively? University students are simple, so how much more so are children in kindergarten and primary school. The teacher’s behavior and teachings will shape their entire lives.

Those four types of initiative should start with teachers. "Actively seeking knowledge." Will teachers ever face questions they cannot answer? When you're a teacher, if you often look up things in a dictionary and often seek advice from those who are knowledgeable, and then give the answers to your students, your students will see that you are eager to learn – "actively seek knowledge, actively ask questions." When you learn, you should learn how to ask. "Actively participate." If there are many school activities, take the lead. The atmosphere of a group also depends on everyone taking initiative. Otherwise, the leaders will have a difficult time. "Actively report." You should report on the situations in your class. “Actively seek guidance.” When making decisions that affect the group, don’t act on your own; seek guidance first. These principles apply not only to subjects and children, but also to students. They are all the same.

In reality, when we reflect on this, we are all sovereigns, parents, and teachers. But we lack the most basic attitude of a student. Because we have not adopted the attitude of a student and perfected it, we encounter problems in all the roles of "sovereign, parent, and teacher." Subordinates may not obey, children may not listen, and students may not learn. Whenever you encounter this, you should immediately remember the saying from our ancestors: "If you don’t succeed, examine yourself." If children don't listen, do I have that same rebellious nature? Don’t look down on this. The heart that doesn't listen also has energy, and when the mind is defiant, it has an impact.

Before, I shared an example of a mother who studied traditional culture but then suddenly was caught up in the Korean Wave, watching Korean dramas. She would watch them all day and night without reading scriptures or listening to lectures. Her daughter was originally very well-behaved, but during the time that her mother was watching Korean dramas, the child was not paying attention in school and was instead reading novels. This shows how much the actions of the parent impact the child. Therefore, when leaders, parents, and teachers see a problem in those under their care, they should immediately reflect on themselves, adjust themselves; that’s what we call harmony between humans and nature. The human is our own heart. What is nature? It is the natural order. Everything we experience is a reflection of our own heart. When the heart is adjusted, the situation will change. So what does traditional culture teach? It teaches that the heart can transform circumstances. If the heart cannot hold itself together, it will be transformed by the circumstances. The key is in our ability to transform the circumstances, to hold on to our true hearts, and to constantly be mindful and then act accordingly.

Next, we discussed that the second point in a subject's duty is to “focus on the fundamentals.” To “focus on the fundamentals” means that “obedience is the foundation of responsibility, etiquette is the foundation of management, and diligence and frugality are the foundation of service.” We mentioned this last time. If we focus on the fundamentals, our children will learn them, and that will benefit them throughout their lives.

Next, we will discuss the third duty of a subject, which is to "establish integrity, be loyal, offer advice, and recommend the virtuous." Through reviewing the *Group of Books 360,* we can understand the moral conduct that a subject should have. On page 38, sentence 61, we discuss establishing integrity. First of all, as public servants and educators, we must not be greedy. The funds we use come from the public; “Your salary is the people’s sweat and toil.” Of course, “establishing integrity” includes many other important virtues, besides not being greedy. For example, being loyal in one's duties and being diligent; these should all be things that we should lead by example.

This sentence talks about, “Yang Zhen, styled Boqi, from Hongnong, was transferred to become the prefect of Donglai.” He was on his way to Donglai to assume his post as prefect. “While passing through Changyi, his former protégé Wang Mi, who had been recommended as a ‘promising talent,’ was serving as the magistrate of Changyi.” So “former” refers to Wang Mi, the talented person whom Yang Zhen had recommended, who happened to be serving as the magistrate of Changyi. “Wang Mi went to visit him.” He went to pay respects. “That night, he brought ten catties of gold as a gift to Yang Zhen.” He brought ten catties of gold to Yang Zhen that night. “Yang Zhen said,” Yang Zhen said, “’When I recommended you, I knew you well, but now you seem to not know me. Why is that?’” I only recommended you to serve the people because I knew your talent. Why do you not understand me? Why do you bring gold? Why would you insult me like that? It's important to understand each other. How could you do this? It’s a form of disrespect to offer him gold like that.

“Wang Mi replied, ‘It is nighttime, no one will know.’” It's already dark; no one will know. Yang Zhen said, “‘Heaven knows, the spirits know, I know, and you know. How can you say that no one will know?’” Heaven knows, the spirits know, I know, and you know, so how can you say that no one will know? Yang family’s hall name later became “The Hall of Four Knowledges,” because Yang Zhen’s integrity influenced his descendants for over a thousand years. This is a great example for scholars and public servants; we should establish our integrity. And like I mentioned earlier, among the four types of initiative, actively participating also means leading by example.

Second, “being loyal.” Let's look at page 40, sentence 64, “When a gentleman serves his superiors,” when a gentleman serves his sovereign or his leaders, “he thinks about loyalty in all that he does,” he should think about loyalty and fulfill his duties with diligence.

I hope this translation meets your expectations. Let me know if you have any other questions or adjustments.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a professional tone suitable for a book:

**Title: A Servant's Duty: Cultivating Virtue and Supporting Excellence**

Of course, his loyalty and dedication were all for the benefit of the people, just as we serve in schools to educate the next generation, shaping them into pillars of society. “Retreat to contemplate and rectify shortcomings” means that when we leave our official duties for the day, we should reflect on our mistakes, work to improve our virtues and knowledge, so that we can serve the greater good. If a minister’s virtue is lacking, leaders will be less likely to take our advice to heart. But if our virtue is high, they will respect us deeply, and our words will carry weight. Similarly, as teachers guiding children, especially considering that we ourselves are part of a generation that has missed out on proper education, with traditional culture having been disrupted for two or three generations, and our own understanding being less than profound, even while we are teaching children *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child) and other classics of traditional culture, we are also learning ourselves. It's even likely that some of our ingrained habits might be worse than those of our students. So, do we need to retreat to contemplate and rectify our shortcomings? We must reflect: has my attitude or behavior today set a negative example for my students? This is something we must repent and rectify.

“Follow along and enhance what is good” means that if the ruler possesses virtuous character and engages in good deeds, we must align ourselves to promote it. In the school setting, when the principal, leaders, grade-level heads, or colleagues have excellent ideas they wish to implement, we should also “follow along and enhance what is good.” We must go all out to support them. Good things often require extra effort, and if these initiatives are successfully implemented, how many students will benefit? Especially in promoting the teaching of sages and the value of correct ideas, we must support it with all our might, no matter the difficulty, because these ideas will be implanted in children’s hearts. “Follow along and enhance what is good.” “Correct and remedy their wrongdoings,” we should help leaders correct and remedy their mistakes. “Therefore, superiors and subordinates can be close to each other”—then your leaders will feel your sincerity, and your relationship will become more loving. Your principal or other leaders will even consult you on important matters. This is inevitable; this is being truly loyal.

When we think of the *Di Zi Gui*, which says, “When parents call, respond without delay,” this is also loyalty. “When parents desire something, do your best to provide it” means doing your utmost. Especially now, with the entire nation, under President Xi's leadership, fully reviving Chinese culture, schools in particular are dedicated to education. In this time, when parents “desire something, do your best to provide it,” we must take the lead and give our all.

The next point is "admonishment." On page 41, item 65, "admonishment" is also discussed in the *Di Zi Gui*, which states: “When there is friendly advice, virtues will be established; when mistakes are not corrected, the Way will be lost for both.” This is our duty, and we would be at fault not to advise others. “When parents have faults, advise them to change.” If our leaders or colleagues err, we must urge them to correct their behavior: “Show a kind face and a gentle voice; if advice is not accepted, advise again with joy; if tears and sighs follow, do not resent any punishment.” Actually, when we are offering advice to leaders or those around us, if we are willing to examine ourselves based on this guidance, we are guaranteed to find areas where we can improve. If you cannot find any such areas, we can discuss it further. We can exchange ideas and learn from each other; there will absolutely be areas for improvement! If you say, "I've looked everywhere, and there truly are none," then you wouldn't have come to me. If you are coming to me, it means that while you have done everything else right, there is still one thing lacking: patience. That's right, why else would you come to me? Because you have done all that you can do, and what's left is patience, waiting for others to grow, and that can’t be rushed. But of course, don’t let my saying this discourage you from coming to me. We can learn from each other.

This verse on “admonishment” speaks of the "three arts of loyalty." There are three strategies, three different ways, of demonstrating loyalty by a minister. These also involve varying levels of skill. The first is called "prevention": “The second is rescue, and the third is warning. To forestall what has not yet happened is called prevention.” To prevent things before they occur, nipping issues in the bud is the highest form of action. “To offer advice when something has just begun is called rescue,” meaning when early signs of error appear, you must quickly offer advice, which is called "rescue," and you will resolve the problem. “To take responsibility after it has occurred is called warning.” "Warning" refers to self-reflection and rectification after something has already happened and has become a reality. “Prevention is the highest, rescue is second, and warning is the lowest.” Since we understand this principle, what should we strive for in our roles as ministers or subordinates? "Prevention." That requires effort; we must have profound insight and foresight.

The fourth point is “recommending the worthy,” which is crucial. Today, if in our current roles we fail to cultivate someone who is as capable as we are, then when we leave, wouldn’t the team suffer greatly? Have we then fulfilled our responsibility? In the past, officials were judged based on the number of individuals of filial piety and integrity they recommended; this was the most important part of their evaluation. Now, evaluations are based on winning gold and silver medals, which is not necessarily accurate. In the past, officials wore hats called “advancing the worthy hats,” which were low in the front and high in the back. If you have watched period dramas from the Song Dynasty, you will have seen them. Recently, there was the TV show about Yue Fei; the high officials in the Song Dynasty wore these “advancing the worthy hats.” People behind should surpass those in front, should surpass us.

A saying goes, “Recommending the worthy receives supreme rewards,” those who recommend virtuous and capable individuals will receive the greatest blessings, even from the heavens; “obstructing the worthy incurs a clear reckoning.” Those who are jealous of talent and try to harm them will suffer the greatest misfortunes for themselves and their descendants; this is very obvious. History provides many examples of this. Let's look at page 43, item 68; this verse highlights the importance of recommending the worthy.

The story is about Zigon asking Confucius, "In the present age, who are worthy and loyal ministers?" Confucius replied, "In Qi, there was Bao Shuya; in Zheng, there was Zipi.” Zigon was very surprised. “Shouldn't it be Guan Zhong of Qi and Zichan of Zheng? They were both brilliant ministers who governed their states well; isn’t that more accurate?” Zigon’s understanding was different from that of Confucius. Then Confucius asked Zigon, "Let me ask you, in the scriptures, do you hear that ‘those who labor are worthy?’ Or ‘those who recommend the worthy are worthy?’” Zigon thought about it for a while, and many truths become clearer when one calms the mind. He said that, “’Recommending the worthy is what makes one worthy.’” Confucius reminded him, "Did you hear of Guan Zhong recommending anyone? Have you heard of Zichan recommending anyone? Obviously, their virtue cannot match that of Bao Shuya and Zipi." “Of the three forms of unfilial conduct, the greatest is having no descendants.” It is the same for parents as it is for ministers and teachers: we must regard recommending and cultivating talent as our primary duty.

Okay, I've shared with everyone the responsibilities of a minister. In our next and final session, we will discuss the third key point: "Correct ideologies and values are essential to guide our students and the next generation.” We will end this session here. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural tone suitable for an English-speaking audience while preserving the original meaning and cultural nuances.

**Lecture 21: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Fulfilling Social Roles and Maintaining Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow learners, good afternoon!

Next, we will discuss the third key point of "Fulfilling Social Roles and Maintaining Sincerity," which is that we must have correct thoughts and ideas. In this way, we are fulfilling our responsibility to increase the students' wisdom. However, each person's understanding of this theme is different. Therefore, this sharing by Li Xu is merely a preliminary discussion, and it is also how we, as leaders, parents, and teachers, must constantly accumulate more well-rounded and wiser thoughts and ideas. For example, if a father is adept at handling people and social situations, his children will have a different perspective than other children. If a teacher is very well-rounded in handling affairs and always considers others, his students will be greatly influenced by interacting with him for just two years. Even when children are with us for several years, whether we react to situations with nervousness, retreat, calmness, or decisiveness in our approach, this will have an impact. Therefore, we can accumulate these thoughts and ideas through life's experiences, and we can even continuously learn more wisdom on how to conduct ourselves from the classics and from history. The depth and breadth of this still requires teachers to put in the effort. The sooner we gain wisdom and demonstrate correct attitudes towards life, the sooner our students will plant good seeds. Confucius "never tired of learning." Why was he never tired of learning? Because the wisdom he gained could immediately help his students. Therefore, the sooner we awaken, the sooner our students will benefit. This is not just for teachers; parents and leaders should also have this sense of mission.

First, what should our thoughts and attitudes be towards others? The first is to be grateful and repay kindness; to remember the source when drinking water. As we say in Minnan dialect, "When you eat fruit, pay homage to the tree; when you eat rice, respect the hoe." When you eat fruit, you should pay homage to the tree and the spirit of the tree. When you eat rice, you should be thankful to the hoe, which is a symbol of the toil that made it possible to have rice. Of course, this also means being grateful to the farmers and for all the conditions that enable us to have food.

Extending this further, we have four great debts of gratitude, the four most important. First, the kindness of our parents. Why is this the most important? Without our parents, how would we have life? Especially before the age of three, our parents raised us through all kinds of difficulties. The hardship of ten months of pregnancy and the labor of childbirth are very painful. Yesterday, I saw one of our colleagues whose wife gave birth to a boy. His wife, who weighs about forty kilograms, was very thin and lost a lot of blood. He said that he was deeply moved and felt that the kindness of mothers is so vast, that women face the danger of death during childbirth. Even after giving birth, mothers are so selfless that they immediately forget their pain and only think about the baby's health. They wash diapers, care for us when we are sick, and breastfeed us with their milk.  They might provide hundreds of kilograms of milk over three years. This is why women’s bones become darker, as much of their nutrients are given to their infants.

Throughout our growth, how much concern do our parents have for us? From our health, our relationships with siblings, to our often fighting and arguing without understanding, which hurts our parents the most. Then there are safety issues. As older siblings, we must pay special attention to the safety of younger siblings and not take them swimming. It is very dangerous. If an accident really happens, how can we face our parents? We must love and protect our siblings.  This also includes our studies, whether we are friendly with classmates, whether we respect teachers, and whether we are diligent in our studies. All of these are parents' worries. This continues when we work. Do we respect our leaders? Can we get along with our colleagues? Later, after marriage, parents still worry about our marital relationship and the education of our children. Therefore, “a mother may live to be a hundred, but still worry about her eighty-year-old child.”  Even at the moment of passing, they are still thinking of their children.

Knowing the kindness we have received, we must repay it, by caring for our parents’ physical needs, their emotional needs, their aspirations, and their wisdom.  In remembering the kindness of our parents, *The Book of Wisdom 360,* page 51, verse 82 states: “*Luxuriant is the Artemisia, yet it is not the Artemisia, but the Artemisia annua.  Ah, the pain of my parents, who labored so much to give me birth.  Without a father, whom should I rely on?  Without a mother, whom should I depend on?  When I go out, I am full of sorrow; when I come in, there is no one there. Father, you gave me birth; Mother, you nourished me. You caressed me, you cared for me, you helped me grow, you educated me, you looked after me and thought of me, you held me close when I went out and came in. The kindness I wish to repay is like the vast sky, limitless.*”

This passage is most evocative of recalling the various ways in which our parents loved us as we were growing up.  It begins by saying that a patch of Artemisia grows luxuriantly.  Looking closer, one sees that it is not Artemisia, but Artemisia annua. When one is filled with worries, one often does not see things clearly.  Because his heart is filled with worries, he even mistakes Artemisia annua for Artemisia. His worries stem from recalling his parents’ hardships.  Therefore, “Ah, the pain of my parents, who labored so much to give me birth.”  Our poor, hardworking parents dedicated their lives to raising and caring for us.  *Qulao* (劬勞) means to work hard, to be haggard.

Of course, we can see the traces of time on our parents’ faces. Mothers, in caring for their children, embark on their children's journey, and also send off their own youth.  And we see the same in our fathers. "A father's illness is the result of the labor and toil of his son."  Our fathers are so strong and tall in our eyes.  Why do fathers get sick? Because they work so hard for the family's finances.  The cumulative labor leads to illness. I feel my father is a giant, and when the giant gets sick, it is as if the family is about to collapse. That's how I felt.  My father has never had to lie down in a hospital in his entire life, thanks to the blessings of our ancestors. My mother did have to go, she was once seriously ill and had to receive IV infusions. I remember it so vividly; it felt as if the world was about to go dark. Without my mother, it was a very frightening feeling. When our mothers are sick, we feel fear deep down. Our parents are truly like heaven and earth to us! So when I sing the song "Kneeling Lamb," "A father's illness is the result of the labor and toil of his son" is so true, and so is “a mother's worries are because her child has not become someone of great value.” As I said before, we have so many bad habits that still cause our parents to worry, which is truly unforgivable.

The person in the *The Book of Wisdom 360* quote has now grown up, but his parents are gone.  He feels that "Without a father, whom should I rely on?" and "Without a mother, whom should I depend on?"  In fact, he feels deep down that he has no way to repay his parents.  And the thing that makes a person feel most at peace is to be able to repay the kindness of parents and of those who have been kind to them. This brings a person the greatest sense of peace and joy.  This is why the ancients left us the greatest sorrow: "The tree desires tranquility, but the wind will not cease; the son wishes to care for his parents, but they will not wait."

Of course, with the wisdom of sages, anything in this world can be transformed, which I believe we emphasized in the last lesson. With the wisdom of sages, we can transform worries into enlightenment, turn crises into opportunities, and transform grief into strength. Although our parents have already left, *The Classic of Filial Piety* tells us, “To establish oneself and pursue the Way, and to make one’s name famous for generations to come so as to honor one’s parents, this is the ultimate goal of filial piety.” When one truly achieves moral and academic accomplishments, the greatest credit for that achievement goes to one’s parents, to one’s ancestors.  Therefore, parents and ancestors receive the greatest blessings. Thus, when we truly “establish ourselves and pursue the Way,” we are giving the best thanks and repayment to our deceased parents. There is nothing in the world that cannot be salvaged, as long as we understand the true nature of things.

Do teachers need to teach the topic of life and death? Yes, we do. Our students will also face the passing of their grandparents and their families. If you don't guide them correctly, they may develop depression. When I was in junior high school, one of my most respected uncles passed away in a car accident. I couldn’t sleep for several days because he had been so kind to me. I wondered, how could such a good person die?  I couldn't understand it. In the end, I had to talk to myself and tell myself that perhaps he had gone to a better place.  It was only by changing my thoughts that I was able to sleep again. As you can see, my attachment was very deep and I was very emotional. We must understand these principles of the universe and of human life so that we can naturally face life and death with an open and correct attitude.

You cannot take your body with you when you leave this world; material possessions are even more impossible to take with you. If you really understand these principles of life, you will strive to improve your wisdom, your spirit, and your virtue which is what you can take with you. You will not pursue material things that you cannot take with you. Not only can you not take them with you, they will worry you until your last breath. You may end up lying in bed for three or five years, gasping for breath, and still clinging to “my house, my car.” How painful! This is the burden of material possessions, which creates a great deal of unnecessary baggage. But Dou Yanshan, after receiving the teachings of the sages, was different. He lived to be over eighty years old.  When he knew his life was coming to an end, he fasted and bathed, cleaned himself completely, and said goodbye to all his relatives. "I'm leaving now," he said. After giving them his goodbye, he sat down, closed his eyes, and passed away peacefully without suffering. He had fulfilled all five blessings, the most auspicious of which is to pass away without suffering, to have a “complete life” (*kaozhongming* 考終命).

How many different situations will our students encounter in their lives? If teachers do not understand these things, how can they guide and assist them? Therefore, teachers in this era must cultivate all kinds of skills.  They must accumulate all kinds of experiences. I'm sorry that I spoke so much Minnan dialect today. It is because I received the news today that the director of the Zhangpu Education Bureau of Minnan has been vigorously promoting the *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child). Every week, all the teachers in that area are trained for seven days at a time. The director of the Education Bureau personally gives the lectures, and many teachers support him. They have been doing this kind of intensive training for a long time, with hundreds of teachers being trained each time. I am truly grateful for such a good official, as I am so happy about this. That's why I spoke more Minnan today. Truly, when officials are in office, they bring blessings to their people. As the *Book of Songs* says, "A noble person is the people’s good fortune. When he is present, many of the people's disasters disappear." When these teachers have learned these things, and are able to educate children, many children who were originally rebellious are changing for the better.

We also heard today that a teacher in Inner Mongolia who has been studying traditional culture was in charge of the worst class in the school. After having them listen to traditional culture lectures for one year, just one day a week, many of the defiant students have changed for the better. As a result, the worst class in the grade had the highest number of students who were admitted into good high schools. This is truly transforming the rotten into the magical! When Songhua River Middle School promoted traditional culture, their academic performance improved rapidly. The school next door used to be much better than them, but after a year or two of promoting traditional culture, their academic performance improved dramatically, surpassing the other school by a lot. People can indeed be taught to be good. I can't share too much good news, otherwise the lesson will never be finished. We must have balance in our actions, and I need to get back to the lesson plan. This is what we mean when we say that “people feel refreshed at good news.” We are happy for those good officials.

The greatest regret for filial children is that they cannot live with their parents and do their best to fulfill their filial duty. Therefore, they feel that “when they go out, they are full of sorrow.” *Xianxu* (啣恤) means to hold onto regret. “When they come home, there is no one there."  *Ru* (入), when they come home, they cannot see their parents, and it feels as if they have not come home at all. The house feels so empty. Thinking about Director Zhai, when he pushes open the door to his home, he says that his greatest happiness is to call out “Mom!” Without parents, it doesn't feel like a home. "Father, you gave me birth." "Mother, you *ju* (鞠) nurtured me." *Ju* means to nurture. The nurturing kindness of three years of breastfeeding is truly profound. Especially in our era, our parents’ lives were difficult when we were young. They had to work and return home to breastfeed us. The pressure our mothers endured was tremendous. We must go back and try to understand this.

We have a classmate who blamed his mother for not caring for him, as she only breastfed him for four months. Later, our class had an activity to "Share Our Ancestors' Virtue.” He went home to understand the circumstances of when he was just a few months old. He learned that his mother had to work and then rush home to breastfeed him. The round trip would take fifty minutes, and she could only take one hour off. This meant she had to feed him in ten minutes. Imagine the pressure of that kind of rush. Therefore, she did not have milk after four months, as her body and mind were too exhausted. We were complaining about our mothers without understanding the situation. Upon understanding it, we realized that we could not have been more unappreciative of our mothers' difficulties.  When we understand our parents' hearts, we know that the kindness of our parents is greater than heaven and deeper than the sea.

When I read "Mother, you *ju* nurtured me," I am very grateful to my grandfather. Because my memory doesn't go back that far, I’ve forgotten what things were like at that time. During our growth, my grandfather would remind us that our mother had to teach at school after giving birth to the three of us. We used to live by the sea. I remember when I was three or four years old, when we moved back to our old home. I moved to Kaohsiung when I was three. My mother had to walk along the coast to get to school. It was a very narrow path and she had to walk very carefully or she would fall into the sea. I still have that memory from when I was six or seven years old. Every day after class, my mother had to rush home to breastfeed the three of us, and that path was very dangerous. My grandfather would say, "Your mother is too tired. She has to teach a class of sixty or seventy students, and also has to come home to take care of the three of you.” Sometimes she would fall asleep right after class, too exhausted to stay awake. Her students would have to shake her awake and say, “Teacher, it’s time for class.” She couldn’t help it, as she was too tired to stay awake. Listening to this really touched me. It was as if I could see the image of my mother rushing back and forth at that time, because I knew the situation of our old home.

If my grandfather hadn't mentioned it to us, how would we have known? He would also say that we were crybabies. He would then tell my mother, "Daughter-in-law, go to sleep, I'll take care of them." My grandfather was also very considerate of my mother. When fathers are considerate of their daughters-in-law, they gain another daughter, and the daughter-in-law gains another father.  It is very subtle. When my grandfather was in his fifties, he had a stomach hemorrhage. If a stomach hemorrhage is not treated in time, it can be fatal. It was my mother who discovered it. So my grandfather would say, "Ah, this daughter-in-law saved my life." You can see the deep connection between a father-in-law and a daughter-in-law. My grandfather would lull us to sleep at night. I would hear him say that he was very sleepy, so he would use his foot to rock us. He would pull a string with his foot to rock us. Later, he became very good at it, and could even rock us while he was asleep. Maybe it was the law of inertia. Hearing this, I am not only grateful for my mother's kindness, but also for the kindness of my grandfather. The health of our character is because of our parents and grandparents, and their reminders of the kindness we have forgotten. This is so important. This is what we mean when we say, “Mother, you *ju* nurtured me.”

"You *fu* (拊) caressed me, you *chu* (畜) loved me." *Fu* means to nurture and *chu* means to love. Our mothers get up earliest, eat last, and after eating, they immediately get busy again, making fruit for us. The nurturing kindness of our mothers is seen in every detail of our lives. Especially in their going to bed last, washing clothes until late, and getting up earliest to make breakfast. *Chu,* or loving kindness, my mother loved us so much. This is why we like to go home, because we always have delicious food to eat. My father also loved us very much. When we were in junior high, we were growing and had to study late into the night. My father would go out to buy hot food for us. I remember in sixth grade of elementary school, my father bought a used car. It was a ten-year-old car and the back seats were bent. The three of us siblings would squeeze in there and our relationships became stronger. Although our family was not rich, why did he buy a car? It was to take our family out on trips. Those trips are memories that last a lifetime. Even though the car didn't run very well, sometimes it would start to roll backward when it was trying to climb a hill. The whole family would scream. Even though it was a ten-year-old car, to us it felt like my father was fully present to support us as we grew up and to give us the best memories in our lives.

Looking at these sentences, it feels like the decades of time just reappear in my mind. "You helped me grow," especially in the growth of wisdom. My father didn't usually talk very much. The main time he would speak up was when I did something seriously wrong. He would then scold me. I remember him reminding me to love myself and not to mistreat myself. "You educated me." The education that our parents gave us was often in every moment of our lives. This includes when I saw my father pat and massage my grandmother’s back. At night, when our grandmother could not sleep, my father would also not sleep. He would stay by her side, all of which left a deep impression on us. My mother only hit me once, two times. Then she turned away and I could tell that my mother was crying and that she didn’t want me to see. “When you hit your child, your heart aches.” This has taught me a lesson for life. How could I bear to cause my parents worry? Many of my relatives and friends have said that my parents look young. My father said that it is because he has not been angered by his children. Actually, my father is too kind. We still did many wrong things. But it is because we deeply feel our parents’ love that we do not want to cause them sadness anymore.  We don't have enough time to repay their kindness, how could we make them sad?

"You looked after me and thought of me." *Guwo* (顧我) means to look after and *fuwo* (復我) means to go back and forth, unable to leave. This was especially evident when we were sick.  The worry was written on their faces, and they would get up several times a night. When we were away at school, our parents would also worry about us.  Especially when we came home, the first thing they would say was, “How did you get so thin?” And they would immediately cook the food that we liked to eat.

Then there was “You held me close when I went out and came in.”  I will tell you a secret. From my memory, I held my mother, even until I was in fourth grade. I still hugged her. My elders would laugh at me for still clinging to my mother at that age. The longer we cling to them, the better the bond between mother and child.  Whenever I think about it, I can still see it in my mind. Of course, the more our mothers love us, and they held us until we were in fourth grade, how can we repay them? We must take the true love that our parents gave us and extend that love to others. This is how we can repay our parents' kindness. Only in this way will our parents’ love for us not be in vain. "You held me close when I went out and came in."

Therefore, “The kindness I wish to repay is like the vast sky, limitless.” As we recall the kindness that is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea and we remember our parents' hardships, when we do not have the opportunity to repay them, we should feel grief and lament the heavens. In our hearts we should remember the kindness of our parents. This is to keenly reflect on ourselves, and we cannot stop this regret. Of course, we must transform this into “to establish oneself and pursue the Way, and to make one’s name famous for generations to come so as to honor one’s parents.” With sincerity, we can touch the heavens, and our parents’ spirits in heaven will be so happy.

Alright, now that we understand the kindness of our parents, let’s see how we can repay them.  Page 57, verse 89 states, “Confucius said: ‘When serving one's parents, a filial child, when at home, shows the utmost respect; when providing for them, provides the utmost joy; when they are sick, shows the utmost concern; when they pass away, shows the utmost grief; and during ancestral sacrifices, shows the utmost solemnity.  When these five are fully implemented, one can truly be said to be serving his parents.”

When serving our parents, we should be respectful in our daily lives, not only ensuring that our parents have no worries about food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also serving them with respectful expressions and respectful hearts. Therefore, when Zixia asked about filial piety, Confucius said, "The most difficult thing is the facial expression."  Serving our parents with a happy, respectful facial expression and attitude is the most valuable thing.

I have encountered parents whose children provided them with food and clothing and did not have to worry about money, and the parents said, "We don't lack money, what makes us most upset is that our children argue with us, and use very disrespectful language and lose their temper at us."  The parents said, “When he argues back like that, it takes me two weeks to recover.” Therefore, “When at home, one should show utmost respect." Respect is very important.  Why does it take them so long to recover? When I heard this, I assumed it was because the parents saw our pure, cute faces when we first came into the world. They had raised us with so much difficulty, through so many years, sharing our joys and our sorrows.


Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, with an emphasis on clarity, natural flow, and accuracy, while retaining the original tone and nuance where possible:

**Translation:**

So, when he sees a son taller than him, a daughter older than him, what he recalls is the entire process of their growth. And today, these children he once held in his arms, with their adorable faces, actually talk back to him. Do you think he can handle that? That’s why sometimes, if we don’t put ourselves in our parents' shoes, we don’t realize how hurtful our words can be.

Therefore, these reminders from the sages are so important. "When caring for them, bring them joy" means that when serving our parents, we should do so with a kind and joyful heart, meeting all their needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transport with "joyful care." When cooking, prepare food that your parents like to eat, and make sure it's not too hard – "soft, warm, and slow." Elderly people have weaker teeth, so food should be cooked soft and tender so it’s easy to chew. Second, it should be served hot, as eating cold food damages the stomach. Don't give cold things to the elderly. Third, elderly people eat more slowly. If they have difficulty chewing, how can they eat quickly? Don’t rush them to finish their meals. And when eating with elderly people, don’t eat too quickly. If the children or grandchildren finish quickly, and say things like, "Grandpa, why are you eating so slowly?" he’ll feel pressured to keep eating. Or, if you start clearing the plates while the elderly person is still eating, that also creates pressure. So, serving the elderly should be done with gentle care, as when people get old, they are like children. We need to be very attentive to their needs. Therefore, when eating with elderly people, we should eat more slowly – in fact, you should eat slower than they do so that they don't feel pressured. If you accompany them, they’ll be very happy.

In terms of clothing, make sure they stay warm. Pay attention to the changing seasons – spring, summer, autumn, and winter – and remind your parents to add layers, or give them new clothes. Sometimes, just feeling their backs to see if they are warm enough, that simple gesture, I think, might make them feel even warmer than the clothes themselves. Sometimes, just hugging our parents, hugging the elderly, these are great ways to have physical connection with them.

Of course, buying clothes also requires filial piety, meaning you should be considerate of your parents' wishes. Don’t buy something that they think is too expensive. Buy good quality but don’t spend too much. Even if you buy good quality and it's not too expensive, your parents might still think it's too pricey. If you bought it for three hundred dollars, tell your parents it cost fifty. Your parents will think, "Oh." If they think it's too expensive, every time they put it on, they'll think, "Oh, it’s so expensive, so expensive.” They won't wear it with a happy heart. So in this case you can tell them, "Fifty dollars." When your parents put it on, they may still say, “It’s still a bit expensive. Go buy me another one tomorrow.” Then you should quickly go buy another one, don’t say, “Ah, I have to buy another one.” Instead, be happy and say, “Okay, okay.” Don't go there calculating, "That's another three hundred." You need to change; if your heart doesn't have your parents, it only has "money." A filial child doesn't have these concepts of money and material possessions. As long as the parents are happy, they will do their best to achieve it.

Looking at the stories of virtue, Zengzi was serving his father, and that day, his father especially liked a certain dish and ate it all. Then, he asked Zengzi, "Is there more?" Even if there wasn’t, Zengzi immediately said "Yes." Why? Because as people age, their stomachs and digestive systems are weaker, and it’s not easy for them to find something they really like to eat. Therefore, when we see an elderly person has a good appetite, a filial son's heart blossoms with joy. He is delighted, and even if there isn't any left, he’ll immediately say "Yes," and then go back to the kitchen and quickly make more, or if he doesn’t have any, he’ll quickly go borrow it. He’ll make sure his father eats with joy and satisfaction. In short, as long as the parents are happy with material things, we should immediately provide them, in order to repay their nurturing kindness. That's what we are talking about regarding clothing.

Food, clothing, and then shelter. The living environment. You must pay attention to the fact that the elderly are most afraid of falling. The bathroom and other areas they use must have non-slip measures. Recently in mainland China, there’s been a strong emphasis on traditional culture. Now, even shoes are available that are made specifically for filial care. These shoes have very slip-resistant bottoms. This is because people are concerned that the elderly will fall. This type of company is sure to succeed, because it's not only running a business, it's also promoting Chinese culture. The soles of these shoes have multiple layers, making them very stable and comfortable for the elderly to wear. Therefore, when considering housing for the elderly, we must think about temperature, humidity, and ventilation.

Furthermore, the elderly are most comfortable living in familiar environments. They’re used to their surroundings, and after eating they can go for a walk and chat with their old friends. They live a very relaxed and comfortable life. However, sometimes we fail to consider the elderly’s feelings and force them to move to the concrete jungle. That's a good analogy. The tall buildings, one after another, are they not like a forest that encloses them? In the urban jungle, their entire life becomes very uncomfortable.

Actually, you might like living in the city, but I like to live in a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters. First of all, the air is fresh, and air is more important than food, for its benefit to our lives. Fresh air and water are best in the countryside. In the city, you have to buy bottled water, which costs even more. You’re surrounded by green mountains and clear waters, and there are a lot of phytoncides. If you are really filial, moving back to the countryside to live with your parents is a good idea. "What about my career?" You don’t understand that your blessings in life, if they are meant for you, you can’t avoid them. Even if you go back to the countryside, you can still earn money and receive those blessings.  And spending the last years of your parents’ lives in such comfort will bring you the greatest comfort in your life.

So, I originally planned, because I had good grades, to become a teacher. It just so happened I was living in the countryside, and I taught there as a substitute for a year. The principal asked me, "Would you like to stay?" There was a mountain right on our school grounds, and after class, I could go hiking. It was especially blissful. But because of my good grades, I was able to return to the city, so I called my dad and said, "Dad, do you think it’s better if I stay in the countryside, or if I come back to the city?" My Dad said, "Come back, it’s closer to home." So I listened to him and went back. Otherwise, I might have been teaching for over a decade in the countryside now, enjoying the moon, brewing tea, and discussing the *360 Classic Works* with others every night. That’s a possibility. There are a lot of these books being printed in Taiwan, and I might be sharing my insights with others. But, in the end, I came home. We are filial, so we should follow our parents’ wishes.

Okay, so regarding food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, these everyday details, we must attend to them with meticulous care to nurture our parents' bodies.  Next, we must nourish our parents’ hearts. We cannot let our parents feel neglected. No matter how busy we are at work, we must spend some time with them when we come home, sit down and talk to them. We must have this kind of filial heart. In reality, our closest family members are the most understanding, but we must use a sincere heart to earn, to feel, their contentment.

Yesterday, I was with our CEO, who is very caring of us. After dinner, he gave us a lot of encouragement, and shared about his relationship with his wife. Everyone should listen carefully to these honest interactions and learn from them. Instead of just thinking about three examples, we should try to understand and apply this to all relationships with everyone.

He mentioned that his work is quite demanding, as he is the head of an organization with over two thousand people. And it’s even more challenging now because he has young children overseas. It’s not easy to be in his position. He goes out in the day when his wife is still resting, and when he returns in the evening, she’s already asleep. He works from dawn to dusk, up before daybreak and returning late at night when it's already dark. So whenever he has time, he makes it a point to spend it with his wife. “Oh, my dear, I have some free time.” As soon as he makes that opening, his wife says, “You’re already working so hard, you should rest.” Because he has his wife in his heart, and knows how hard she is working, the first thing he does when he’s free is to make time for her. When his wife feels his sincerity, she immediately says, “You are working so hard, you should rest,” and perhaps she'll cook him something special. That’s my speculation, and I’ll confirm it with the CEO after class.

You see, when a husband and wife treat each other with such sincerity, their children will naturally understand the principles of marriage, and every day be a model for them. Similarly, when we make time, we think about our parents and children. Even though we may not have a lot of time to spend with them, they will definitely be able to feel our sincerity. When sincerity is put into action, our closest family members will surely feel it. Why can’t people do it? It’s because their hearts are cold. Their hearts are not in it. That’s why they can’t do it. And then they will have very good excuses like, "I'm so busy, I don't even have time to eat..." This is a sign that the times are somewhat out of order, where those who make the most money seem to call the shots. Everyone gives them the green light as if they are not obligated to spend time with their parents or family. This is not right.

Any situation where we feel we are neglecting our family because we spend too much time away is not right. Do you spend so much time outside with a sincere heart? If you don’t love your parents and family, "Not loving one's relatives while loving others, is called deviating from virtue." It’s not proper. Especially when learning traditional culture, if you still make your parents or family feel neglected, then "Come here!" You should be punished because you have failed to be a good example. Now that I mention it, I need to repent. When I was in university, when I came home, it seems like I always ran off to see my friends. This was me neglecting my parents and sister. Later, my sister gave me a hint, saying, "When you come home, your time at home is like dipping something in soy sauce," you dip it and then you’re gone, you disappear. I felt so ashamed. But yet my parents were so understanding and forgiving.

Okay, we must not let our parents have worried minds. Whatever is causing our parents to worry, we must quickly correct and eliminate. We must not let our parents have fearful minds. If they are scared or worried, this is not okay. We need to address it quickly.  We must not let them have melancholy minds, filled with sadness and worry. We must not let them have minds filled with unspoken thoughts, holding back what they want to say. This is very unfilial. We need to make sure that our parents’ inner thoughts and feelings can always be shared with us. We cannot let our parents have feelings of guilt or regret, or resentment. We cannot make them ashamed, regretful, or blaming.

To truly nourish our parents' hearts and minds, there is a very good saying. "That which the parents desire to do", "desire to do" refers to the parents' aspirations or goals. "I carry it on," meaning, we should develop our parents' work or fulfill their desires and goals, “I carry it on.” “That which the parents care for deeply,” meaning the siblings, grandchildren, or children that the parents worry about, because parents themselves have siblings, children, and grandchildren.  "Those they care for deeply, I love dearly."

Yesterday, one of our alumni talked about his father who had an older sister. They had emigrated to Malaysia, and his father’s sister was still living in mainland China, where her life was very difficult. He often sent money back to his aunt. Later, all his aunt's children were able to go to university, and this was all because of his father's support for his aunt and those nephews and nieces. When he took such care of his aunt and her descendants, who was the happiest? His parents!  For parents, their children and grandchildren are like the branches and leaves, and the parents themselves are the roots.

This is how we nourish our parents' hearts, and their ambitions. Finally, we need to nourish our parents' wisdom. Confucius reminds us, "For the elderly, guard against being attached to gain." When people get older, the most important thing is to read the teachings of the sages to grow in wisdom, become more open-minded, and more able to let go. If they don’t deeply study the teachings of the sages, society will promote comparison. Constantly comparing ourselves to others leads to a lot of anxiety, worry about gain and loss, and they won’t have any peace. Therefore, filial children should ensure that their parents immerse themselves in the teachings of the sages in their later years, they will be at peace, and their lives will be full and purposeful. Okay, this is how we nourish our parents’ wisdom.

Returning to what we were discussing, we must first know and repay our debts of gratitude. For our teachers, the most important way to repay their kindness is to practice what they taught and make contributions to society. This will bring the greatest satisfaction to the teachers who have guided us. Of course, when we go home for the New Year, we must visit our teachers. Our teachers are getting old, so we must bring them the *Essentials of Governance from Ancient Books*, the *Rules for Students*, and *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*. Our teachers will be very happy that their students are learning these things. When you bring these to your teachers, it’s possible that when other students visit them, the teacher will then introduce these books to them, and then all of your former classmates will have the chance to learn from them. We know how precious it is to encounter the teachings of our ancestors, so we must cherish, preserve, and cultivate the opportunity to connect more people to the teachings of the sages, because this is our responsibility, as we are now disciples of the sages.

We have just discussed the country's debt to us. And we also owe gratitude to the public. "A single day's needs are provided by a hundred trades." A single person’s daily life is made possible by all kinds of industries. So how do we repay all the trades that are involved in providing us with the necessities of life? Firstly, we need to do our own jobs well, do our professions well, and in doing so we will benefit society. When everyone does their best in their own position or profession, the entire society will be peaceful and prosperous. Everyone will do their part.

Next, when we encounter people in different trades and industries that are providing a service to us, we should express our sincere gratitude to them. For example, when we are driving, the tollbooth worker is also providing us with a service. As you pass through, give them a friendly greeting, or say thank you.  This could make them happy for three days. When you go to a restaurant, thank the service staff. This could make their entire work day very pleasant. Perhaps because you are so grateful to them, the next time you go there, they’ll add extra food for you. And the third time, remember to bring books to give to them. If they study it, then when they serve others, they might give them books about these teachings, and then your merits will be immeasurable. Your gratitude will be an excellent example of learning traditional culture. Others are giving you the chance to build connections, and then you, in turn, give others the chance to build connections.

"If Confucius had not been born, the world would still be a long, dark night." In this materialistic age, if we had not encountered the teachings of Confucius and other sages, how could there be light in our lives? Because we ourselves have walked through the darkness, we cannot bear to see others spend even a second in that darkness. I remember, when someone said they wanted a copy of *Rules for Students*, or *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*, we would send it to them no matter how late it was. We always had books in the car, and if you spoke to someone and their eyes lit up, we’d pull a book out. You might only meet that person once in your life, or maybe just that one time. If you try to give it to them another time, maybe the circumstances will not align.

Okay, this is about our debt to the public. Our ancestors have left us with a saying: "When you receive a drop of water in kindness, you should repay it with a gushing spring of gratitude." When I read this sentence, it resonates with the background of this stage, because even a drop of kindness should be cherished in your heart. There’s a story in history that talks about “a meal worth a thousand pieces of gold.” Once, a woman saw Han Xin when he was down on his luck. Seeing that he was emaciated and looked like he had been starving for days, she took pity on him and cooked a meal for him. Han Xin kept that kindness close to his heart, and didn't dare to forget it. Later, when he became a great general, he sought out that woman and rewarded her with a thousand pieces of gold. This is the origin of the story of “a meal worth a thousand pieces of gold,” which comes from Han Xin not forgetting this kindness of a meal.

Furthermore, what else was extraordinary about Han Xin? Once, a young man had insulted him by making him crawl between his legs. Han Xin sought that young man out as well. The young man was terrified, thinking "Today may be my last day," and knelt down trembling, saying, "General, please spare my life!" However, Han Xin was grateful to him for making him cultivate his ability to endure humiliation. A person’s accomplishments are directly proportional to their patience and their ability to endure insult. If he hadn't been able to endure it that day, and had instead gotten into a conflict, there might have been death and injury. Therefore, this encounter reminded him that he must be able to yield. Now that he had achieved success, he thanked him. Not only did he not punish the young man, but he even gave him a government position.

If everyone understands this story, that he was even grateful to the person who had shamed him, then we can learn from this and live in a world of gratitude, in which everyone and everything is there to help us improve and achieve our goals, whether it is with beneficial opportunities or challenges.  If someone scolds me, it makes me develop mental strength and stay calm and not be affected. In this way, they are also helping me. And when someone scolds or slanders me, and I have not committed such a wrong, "When a person is unjustly slandered without having committed any fault, their descendants will often flourish suddenly," as *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* says. So, when someone scolds you, is it a good thing or a bad thing?  It seems like you can’t quite swallow it. So, if you can really understand this saying, then peaceful days will come to you. If it penetrates your heart, “I did nothing wrong, yet they scold me; they are giving me good fortune, and I am developing my wisdom." Why? Because "all teachings are achieved through patience." If you can endure it, you will be able to be calm, and from that calmness, wisdom will arise.  If someone scolds you, and immediately you become furious, then all of your merits are burned away. So, not only is he giving me good fortune, he is also giving me the opportunity to develop wisdom and hone my skills.

If we truly understand these principles, then every day is a good day, every moment is a good moment, every person is a good person, and every event is a good thing. Nowadays many people want to emigrate. But if you truly understand these things, what's the point of moving around all the time? In the end, many people who have gone overseas eventually return. Why? Because the language, lifestyle, and background are all different.  Our ancestors have left us with virtuous ways, and China, and wherever the Chinese people live, will become better and better. More importantly, we need to listen to the wisdom of the ancients. "If you don't heed the words of the elders, you will suffer soon enough. If you heed the words of the elders, happiness is waiting."

Next, we need to approach others with love and respect. This is a very important attitude to cultivate. No matter what kind of circumstances you encounter, even if someone is causing you trouble, you should still think about them with the intent to help them, because “sincerity can move even stone and metal.” This will resolve the situation. However, if someone is causing trouble and you have conflict, it will never end. Therefore, we must have tolerance, and those who learn from the teachings of the sages “correct themselves, without demanding it of others.” Don’t make demands of others; make demands of yourself and correct yourself.  Even if others do not respect me, I must respect them. Otherwise, I have not truly learned from Confucius’ teachings. "The noble person understands righteousness.” We should treat people with righteousness and a heart of benevolence. Confucius never said that you should only love those who are good to you.  Master Yan Hui said, “When people treat me kindly, I will treat them kindly; when people do not treat me kindly, I will still treat them kindly.” This is what cultivation is all about. Yanzi said, "When people are unkind,” using a beautiful phrase from the *Book of Odes*, “When people are unkind,” and treat me with malice, "I treat them as brothers.” We should treat them as brothers. Only in this way will the situation resolve itself and will we be able to set the best example for society.

Okay, so where should we begin to learn traditional culture? When you go back today, consider who the person is that you dislike the most. Start practicing with them. Put their picture next to your bed, and before you go to sleep and when you wake up, bow to them. Slowly, your heart will change. Once you’ve done that, then go practice in person. This is called a step-by-step approach. Otherwise, if you encounter them suddenly, sometimes you will not be able to change and you will start fighting with them again. We can practice first. This is what it means to “put in the real work."

“Start with what is difficult.” How do we bring the Great Way of Benevolence into our life? We start by working to change the most difficult habits and by practicing compassion and respect towards the people who are the most difficult for us. This shows courage and magnanimity! If you truly want to accomplish something, if you truly want to be a good example for society, if you truly want to benefit all sentient beings, then you must put in the effort. People who are not willing to change their habits are lacking a strong will or a sincere desire to benefit others. Because if we don’t change, we will have a negative impact on others, and a negative impact on our children. If you truly love them, how could you want that?  If you know that smoking is bad for your children’s health, and that feeling of love for your child arises, you will quit immediately. Does anyone here smoke? No one does. You are all good students.

This is not difficult. Why respect others? Because we are clear about these principles. Everyone has the potential to become a sage or a virtuous person. How can we not respect them? Everyone has the inherent brightness of their true nature. We have a connection with them today with no other purpose than to help them become a sage or a virtuous person, otherwise, it would be such a waste. That is why we respect them. And love? To have the heart of our ancestors, how can there not be love and harmony among the people?  We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and that’s why every time we hear the "Ode to the Yellow Emperor," it is so moving, because we feel what the emperors and other sages felt, and you will no longer see anyone you don't like.

So how do we show this love? In our relationships with relatives and friends, we should "be willing to share what is difficult; do what is difficult to do; endure what is difficult to endure; share confidences, without divulging them; not look down on those who are poor; not forsake those who are suffering."

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**Book Translation:**

Expressing care and love among relatives and friends requires navigating "the difficult and the possible." If someone is in urgent need of money, we should help them with the meaning of sharing resources. "The unbearable and the bearable" – are there any families without friction? We should be able to tolerate, give way, be patient, and be modest. "The hard and the doable" – take the lead in doing the hard and tiring tasks; take the lead in making sacrifices. When relatives and friends share their innermost thoughts with you, you mustn't tell others; not airing family secrets is also crucial. "Poverty should not diminish respect" – even if they are poor or of lower status, we should still love and respect them. Furthermore, even if they are poor, we must remember the care and love they showed us when we were young. We must never let ourselves be tainted by wealth and status; this is the greatest tragedy in life. The greatest wealth in life is the elevation of wisdom and the constant maintenance and improvement of a genuine heart – this is what we can take with us. When relatives and friends encounter hardship, we should absolutely never abandon them but help them wholeheartedly.

If a group fully implements these points, its cohesion and unity will be extremely strong. Everyone in this group will feel very secure because if a problem or situation arises, everyone will help them pull through, ensuring they can overcome any difficulty. Others may experience ups and downs in life, whether in their studies or careers. Will we? Yes. If we help others when they fall, then when we stumble ourselves, we will inevitably reap the consequences – others will help us. "What you do to others will be done to you." So, who is the most unfortunate? Those who are petty, who are unwilling to suffer a loss; they are the ones without blessings.

Furthermore, regarding our attitude toward others, our teachers have taught us: “Mutual respect, mutual love, mutual care, mutual support, and mutual cooperation.” When we can do this, timing is not as important as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as important as harmony among people. This "harmony among people" can certainly bring prosperity to families and careers. Even our CEO's company, by implementing this, has not only touched China but is now also inspiring many entrepreneurs in Malaysia and creating positive connections overseas, earning deep admiration. Who wouldn't want their company or organization to feel like a family?

There was an employee who left the CEO's company five years ago. Upon hearing news of her serious illness, the entire company raised funds and quickly went to visit and help her. Amazingly, her mother said that her current company hadn't come to see her; how was it that her company from five years ago came? The company colleagues responded by saying that even though she had left the company, she was still part of their family, and they still needed to care for her. This ability to care for one's employees is an act of benevolence. "With virtue comes people; with people comes land; with land comes wealth; and with wealth comes utility." Nowadays, many parents, for example, if their son is moved by their company's culture, will say, “Then I will even have my daughter work in this company." Therefore, in our CEO's company, there are many parent-child combinations, sibling combinations, and so on, and these pairings should be increasing. This saves on recruitment costs. What is the biggest loss for companies today? Staff turnover. When there is turnover, you have to retrain, which is the greatest loss. In their company, people don’t leave, and their relatives and friends come instead.

Thus, "Heaven has no favorites; it always favors the benevolent." The heavens will bless any group that practices benevolence. I believe that our ancestors and sages are also protecting them. A company that wholeheartedly promotes Chinese culture will thrive. Therefore, Gu De’s vision is to bring the teachings and culture of the sages to the world for the benefit of all mankind. Our nation values ethics and morality the most. In every profession, we should follow the teachings of the sages and connect with their wisdom. Thus, in medicine, we have the "Way of Medicine"; in business, the "Way of Business"; in education, the "Way of Teaching". Every profession has the opportunity to cultivate the conditions for creating sages. With over two thousand employees nurtured in such an environment, more than two thousand families are truly at peace.

Next, we'll discuss the fourth point: in our interactions with others, we should detach ourselves from love and hate, from likes and dislikes. We should let go of the heart that likes one person and dislikes another. If we do not remove this mindset, wherever we go, we will create conflict. We will be biased towards those we like and be against those we dislike, and our actions will lack virtue and wisdom. So, we must first work hard to let go of hatred and these feelings of like and dislike. With what kind of heart should we replace them? With a heart of equal respect and equal compassion. Furthermore, if we understand human nature and the logic of things, those closer to us need stricter treatment, while those colleagues further away from us should receive more tolerance and care. This is the normal way. If we treat those close to us too well, people will feel that we are favoring them, and when we neglect those who are already distant from us, they will inevitably start to overthink.

This is something I haven’t done very well. Last night, our CEO invited me to a dinner meeting with our English team. The colleague sitting next to me said, "This is the first time I’ve had a meal with Teacher Cai since coming to the center." This made me a little ashamed and almost unable to eat. Another colleague from the English team said, "Me too." Luckily, I had already agreed to attend one of their classes next month. Our colleagues are all very lovely, and I admire them greatly. My investigation revealed that they had all achieved great things in their previous careers or in their teaching roles. Yet, they gave those up to come to our big family; this is a rare and precious connection. We should cherish, love, and support each other, helping one another achieve our goals. Therefore, I cannot be biased; I must treat everyone with equal love and equal compassion.

Next, the fifth point is a very good teaching regarding people, which I am sharing with everyone; there is no single correct answer. Your lives are also full of richness, and you will surely accumulate many good attitudes on how to treat others and handle matters that can be shared with others. This fifth point is a teaching from our mentors: "Others' mistakes are also correct; my correctness is also incorrect."

Why are others' mistakes also correct? If they make a mistake, it's because they haven't learned. "If a person does not study, they will not know." They aren't aware of what's right or wrong. It's a common occurrence. How can they do it right if they haven't learned? They're not Confucius reincarnated. If we can't be tolerant of others' mistakes, then we are too harsh. So, others' mistakes are also correct. Maybe someone might say, "But they've been studying for five years and are still like this?" People can come up with a hundred excuses and reasons for not following teachings. If someone has been studying for five years and is still making mistakes, they are even more pitiful! Does that make sense? Yes, because they are stuck in a rut and can't pull themselves out. Not only should you not be angry with them, but if they are learning wrongly and you get angry, doesn't that show how small your heart is? Furthermore, if they learn incorrectly, fall down, and their name tag says they’ve learned the *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child), and then they do something wrong, people might say, "Look, those who study the *Di Zi Gui* are all like that," and they will create bad karma and bear the responsibility. Therefore, the longer someone has studied and still struggles, the more compassionate you should be towards them, and you should do everything you can to help them. We should have love and respect in our hearts and put ourselves in their shoes. Why should we argue or create problems with them? Change your mindset, and you will never be in conflict with anyone. Therefore, "When doing things, think of others; when judging others, first reflect on yourself." Have our own attitudes strayed?

"My correctness is also incorrect." If I think I’m right when others are wrong, then a sense of superiority arises, and I will want to argue with others over who is right and who is wrong. The home is not a place for arguing right and wrong; arguing logic with family will only make you furious. Spouses and relatives need to focus on love and affection; when you focus on love, you care for each other. Therefore, "my correctness is also incorrect." With this sense of superiority, using logic to suppress others is not right.

Finally, the last point: do not be suspicious of others. A lack of trust between people is the greatest danger to a group; it easily collapses. You might say, "But they still have many problems." If they have many problems, then we have a responsibility to help them correct them. Don't doubt “At birth, people are naturally good.” Don't be suspicious of each other and spread rumors, as this undermines the hearts of others, and that is the most serious.

Furthermore, judging others is an unkind attitude. Why? Do we fully understand them? Do we have an objective understanding of what they are currently doing? Wouldn't that be arbitrary? One older student was taught by his father, "Don't casually criticize someone until you have known them for at least three years." Because you don't have enough time to understand them, you might be misjudging them, and if you tell others, you’ll be hindering their connections, which would create bad karma.

Alright, it's time for today's sharing. Next week, we'll finish discussing the attitudes toward matters and things. Thank you everyone!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text from Chinese to English, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and cultural sensitivity:

**Lecture 22: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Harmonize Relationships and Fulfill Duties; Repel Evil and Uphold Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

Looking at the *Essentials of Governance from Ancient Books*, we can see that emperors throughout history have all respected teachers. As the saying goes, "Only when teachers are respected will the Way be revered, and only when the Way is revered will the people know to respect learning." By respecting teachers, and consequently respecting morality and learning, each individual will have wisdom and virtue, and the world will be at peace. Therefore, our theme for these past few lectures has been “Being a Benefactor to Your Child for Life,” and last week's focus was the seventh key point, “The Importance of Self-Education,” specifically the fourth aspect: “Harmonize Relationships and Fulfill Duties; Repel Evil and Uphold Sincerity.”

Within "Harmonize Relationships and Fulfill Duties; Repel Evil and Uphold Sincerity," we further divided the discussion into three areas for in-depth exchange and exploration. To fulfill one's duty, in the role of a teacher, one must be "a ruler, a parent, and a teacher." Extending this further, in any role we play, we must play it completely, so that others accept and trust us. The spirit of being a "ruler, parent, and teacher" must be present. A “ruler” leads by example; a “parent” cherishes and never gives up; a “teacher” guides patiently and seizes opportunities for education.

And yet, a teacher is also a subject of a ruler and a disciple. Especially in our times, even those who engage in education at schools typically only receive four years of teacher training. For example, before I started teaching at a school, I attended a teacher training program for one year after graduating from university. After one year, they called us teachers. Looking at the classics of our ancestors, being called a "teacher" fills one with trepidation, as if walking on thin ice. Why? Because virtue does not match the position, the name does not match the reality. “A teacher is one who imparts the Way, transmits knowledge, and resolves doubts.” What Way to impart? What knowledge to transmit? What doubts to resolve? One might even have many unresolved doubts in one’s own life. If one cannot awaken oneself, how can one awaken others? Therefore, engaging in education requires being worthy of the name. One must delve deeply into the classics and continuously gain understanding. Furthermore, one must first possess the attitude of a student. If, today, we teach at school and believe that we are qualified to be teachers, then we lack self-awareness. If we do not understand ourselves, how can we inspire wisdom in others? Therefore, it is important for people to know themselves. We must be clear about our level of understanding.

In this era, when two or three generations have neglected the teachings of the sages, we are all in a state of remediation. Therefore, we must start from the fundamentals. Hence, within "Harmonize Relationships and Fulfill Duties," one must fulfill the duty of a disciple. As we have previously shared, we should proactively ask questions and inquire when we do not understand something. This is actually the basic attitude towards learning as described in *Standards for Students*, "When in doubt, make a quick note; Ask others, to be precise.” When we hear this, everyone nods and agrees. But let me ask, in the past seven days, facing so many people and events, have we encountered anything we didn’t understand? Regarding what we didn't understand, have we sought clarification from the classics or from others? If not, then this statement remains merely knowledge.

Why don't we proactively seek clarification? Because we think there is always tomorrow. “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, how many tomorrows are there? If I wait for tomorrow, all things will be delayed.” Thus, we lack a proactive attitude towards learning. Furthermore, our desire to benefit others is not strong enough. When studying the teachings of the sages, "Compassion is the foundation." Our desire to benefit others should be very strong. The sooner we understand, the sooner we can benefit our children and others. We must always recognize our shortcomings and mistakes in the face of events, identify why certain behaviors occurred, and determine in which aspects our hearts need to be corrected and elevated. Mencius said, "The way of learning is nothing other than seeking to recover our lost heart." A true heart should always desire to benefit others. Therefore, we must proactively improve and break through our limitations. This is a manifestation of love for others.

We are not just students and disciples (we are disciples of the sages), we are also subjects. In school, we are subordinates to the principal. In fact, we must consider what kind of learning we truly want to impart to our students. We must first understand the learning ourselves and then practice it. If we ourselves do not practice with diligence and our knowledge and actions are not aligned, it will be difficult for students to trust us.

And what should we learn? "There is no person outside of relationships, and there is no learning outside of relationships." These relationships are nothing more than the five constant relationships. There are three constant relationships at home. When we leave home, it extends to the relationship between ruler and subject (leader and led), and friend relationships. Within the family there are the relationships between husband and wife, father and son, and siblings. The learning does not go beyond these five constant relationships. If we cannot get along with our leaders at school, how can we teach our students the principles of "benevolent ruler, loyal subject?" These are all issues we must consider. If a teacher cannot maintain harmonious relationships at home, and even carries their negative emotions to school, the students may suffer the consequences. In our student days, have we experienced teachers coming in, and the students saying, “Be careful, there might be a storm coming”? If we act like this on the platform, we are unable to set a good example. “When learning is profound, one’s temperament is calm.” If we frequently let our students feel our negative emotions on the platform, or even express criticism or anger regarding the five relationships, we cannot teach children how to live harmoniously with others.

Confucius possessed a spirit that those engaged in education must constantly strive for: "When hearing of good teachings, one must personally practice them before guiding others to do so." Upon hearing good teachings, we must personally— “personally” means actually implementing it— before guiding students to do so. This is teaching through example.

This attitude is very important for the third aspect of our discussion, that is, a teacher must have correct ideas and values. How do they treat people, matters, and things? Their attitude toward others can be revealed at any time in front of the students. When is education occurring? Some might think it is only when one is on the platform; parents might think it is when they call their children in front of them to start educating them. But in fact, every action and every thought subtly influences. Even when one does not see their children, one's thought waves can influence them. As we discussed before, there was a mother who was very dedicated to studying traditional culture. But for a period of time, she started watching Korean dramas, and became obsessed. She would watch them until the early hours of the morning. Suddenly, she noticed that her daughter was not studying diligently at school and was secretly reading novels. The mother didn't let her daughter see her watching Korean dramas, but her lack of diligence influenced her daughter. Therefore, the hearts of parents and children are connected. It is definitely so.

Last time, when we discussed "how to treat people," we discussed that first, it is essential to be grateful and remember the source of our blessings. This is the foundation of being a good person.

Second is to cherish love and respect. At any time, even when there are conflicts or friction with others, "The Way cannot be abandoned for even a moment." Do we respect the other person? Do we love and consider their perspective? This heart of love and respect "cannot be abandoned for even a moment." We must always be able to bring it forth; otherwise, our study of the sage’s teachings will become superficial. If we respect some and not others, we are learning inequality, favoritism, and arrogance. Do we only respect those we look up to, while disregarding those we look down on? This is a distorted way of learning. Not only must we be equally respectful to people, we must also be equally respectful at any time. We should be respectful when teachers are watching us, and we should still be respectful when teachers are not watching us; we must be respectful in front of others, and we must also be respectful when we are alone; when we are at work, we must be respectful to our leaders, and we must also respect our leaders when we are not at work. Otherwise, we are simply putting on a show for others.

Third, we mentioned respecting each other, loving each other, caring for each other, taking care of each other, and cooperating with each other. In fact, these attitudes toward others, while not easy, are not impossible. The key lies in our ability to let go of our egos and always think of others. If we do that, it’s not difficult. But if we are self-centered, it is easy to indulge our thoughts and actions.

Fourth, we mentioned detaching ourselves from love and hate, and from likes and dislikes, so that we can be equally respectful and equally compassionate.

Fifth, we share a reminder: "Even when others are wrong, they are also right; even when I am right, I am also wrong." With such a mindset, we understand forgiveness and constantly examine whether our hearts are biased, superior, or arrogant. If our hearts are biased, then what qualifications do we have to criticize others or discuss right and wrong? Therefore, we must first do well ourselves, and then naturally influence others. This is called "rectifying oneself to transform others." This is a very important attitude.

For example, when we are talking to someone, we might say, "Oh, that person bought that expensive car, it costs hundreds of thousands!" We might respond, "So what? I don't care for those things; I am content in poverty. I don't pursue those vain things." While others may be greedy for material possessions, when we say such things, aren’t we actually being greedy too? We are also putting ourselves on a pedestal, claiming that we do not pursue those things; we might even be greedy for this self-proclaimed nobility. Therefore, when we criticize others for being greedy, we may also be greedy at that very moment. Thus, the example of Su Dongpo is very good. "If the heart is filled with Buddha, then one sees a Buddha in others; if the heart is filled with dung, then one sees dung in others." If our heart is free of greed, anger, ignorance, and arrogance, then even if we encounter others with these flaws, we will not manifest them ourselves. The encounter will not trigger them in us.

For example, if someone speaks to you with arrogance, you might say after they leave, “So what? They just graduated with a master’s degree; what's so great about it?” In the very moment of saying that, our arrogance also arises. For example, if we say, "Don't be angry, okay? Speak a little softer!" While we are telling others that, aren't we failing to set an example ourselves? We also have become upset. Therefore, the effort in learning from the sages lies in “observing one’s own heart well," and being able to see constantly whether our thoughts are awakened or confused, right or wrong, pure or tainted.

Sixth, we discussed not being suspicious in our interactions. Of course, when discussing these ways of handling situations, we must also have the right attitude. For example, when we talk about gratitude and repayment, it is about us being grateful and repaying. Otherwise, we might understand this principle and then look at others' faults, thinking that they have no gratitude, or that they have no love and respect for others. Therefore, those who learn from the teachings of sages focus on their own actions rather than criticizing others. “By rectifying ourselves and not demanding of others, we will have no resentments.”

We should not be suspicious of others, but if others are suspicious of us, we should practice “being strict with ourselves and lenient with others,” and reflect on ourselves. “A noble person is ashamed not of self-cultivation.” This statement is also in *Essentials of Governance from Ancient Books*. "A noble person is ashamed not of self-cultivation, but not ashamed of being insulted; ashamed of not being trustworthy, but not ashamed of not being trusted; ashamed of lacking ability, but not ashamed of not being given a position." A noble person is ashamed of not having genuine self-cultivation, not ashamed of being misunderstood or insulted. If we become upset when we are misunderstood or insulted, then where is our cultivation? “Accepting insult without retort and hearing slander without defending” is true mastery. We must value substance, and we must understand what is truly shameful and what is not. One might feel ashamed for being looked down upon by others. That’s not right. Not being able to follow the teachings of sages is what is truly shameful. We should be "ashamed of not being trustworthy," that is, ashamed of not acting in a way that inspires others' trust. We should not be ashamed that we have acted rightly but that others still do not trust us. We can be at peace with ourselves, without forcing it. Time will reveal the truth. We cannot become agitated just because someone does not trust us. That will lead us to force and demand trust from others. We must let things flow naturally, not by forcing them. We should be "ashamed of lacking ability," that is, ashamed of not being capable of fulfilling our duties well, but not ashamed of not being given the opportunity. Therefore, in each moment, we must demand of ourselves, not of others.

For example, during an activity, if we are not assigned an important task and feel sad, thinking "I must be given this task. If you don't give it to me, I won't do anything, I won't learn anything." This is being overly concerned with appearances. This mindset is incorrect. If others are capable of doing it, there’s no problem in letting them do it. If we say we will not do anything because we have no opportunity to perform, then we are threatening our leaders. We should ask ourselves if we are clear about our motivations and actions. This kind of mindset is driven by emotions. Therefore, it is right for the supervisor not to use us. In order to accomplish something, we must think of the big picture and not get angry easily. Therefore, when we are not understood or are not valued, we should instead reflect on where we might be lacking. This will lead to further advancement, rather than getting upset.

Sixth, we discussed not being suspicious, but not demanding that others trust us. And why should we not be suspicious? Because those who learn the teachings of the sages believe in “At birth, human nature is good.” They believe that everyone has innate goodness, so they will not have preconceived notions about others. Even when events occur, because they do not have preconceived notions, they will not make rash judgements. When we see an action or a situation, and think “They must be doing such and such,” we have already formed a judgement, it’s too hasty. We should make sure to fully understand the situation to avoid misunderstandings. And even if after fully understanding the situation, if the other person is indeed wrong, we still will not have any preconceived notions. Why? "If not educated, nature deteriorates." That is because they have acquired bad habits, not their original nature. Therefore, we believe that everyone has original goodness, and we should always maintain trust in others. If we have a connection with someone, we should go further in fulfilling our duty, because their true nature is lost and they are being controlled by greed or anger. This is where we put the principles of *Standards for Students* into practice. “Friendly advice, will build virtue; Failing to correct, will harm both paths.”

Yesterday, a friend said to me, “A true cultivator does not see the faults of the world.” I replied that “not seeing the faults of the world” means not holding those faults in our hearts, which would become a preconceived notion. But it does not mean we do not understand right and wrong. If you see your child getting angry and you say, “A true cultivator does not see the faults of the world,” what will happen to your child? They will think “My dad won’t dare to discipline me.” How can that be? Therefore, we must not interpret this statement literally, we must understand its underlying meaning. We should not hold any preconceived notions in our hearts, and we should always believe in “At birth, human nature is good.” However, we should be able to discern clearly. This is not called “discrimination;” this is called “clarity,” knowing right from wrong. We should be clear about our responsibilities, and fulfill as much as we can. Thus, the idea is harmonious. “Not seeing the faults of the world” and “giving friendly advice” can be integrated together.

Now, we will discuss the seventh point, which is that we must learn to be tolerant in dealing with things. Today is the New Year for our Hindu brothers and sisters, isn't it? Good, let's mark the occasion by using teachings from Hinduism to talk about tolerance. This is very meaningful, why? Because our era is in chaos, we are indeed living in unprecedented times. This is not an exaggeration. Look at the conflicts within families, they have never been this serious before. Open up the newspaper, and see how many places are at war. There are also more serious natural disasters. So we all have a responsibility in these times, "The rise and fall of the world is every person's responsibility." This is the mindset we should have when reading the books of our ancestors, or our learning will be for naught. *The Great Learning* tells us "Those in ancient times who wished to illuminate their bright virtue to the world," did so with this mindset, "first governed their state; those who wished to govern their state, first harmonized their families; those who wished to harmonize their families, first cultivated themselves; those who wished to cultivate themselves, first rectified their hearts; those who wished to rectify their hearts, first made their intentions sincere." If we do not make our intentions sincere and rectify our hearts, how can our hearts be tolerant of others? How can we truly achieve sincerity and rectitude of heart? Through the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge. If we do not let go of selfishness and self-interest, how can we be tolerant of others? If we do not let go of right and wrong, how can we not be in opposition to others?

Our teacher had a conversation with our former Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir. Both elders are benevolent people with the world in mind. When they met, the first thing they discussed was the issue of world peace. Everyone has heard this before, right? What does this have to do with us? "Countries should live in harmony and treat each other equally; races should live in harmony and treat each other equally." This should especially resonate with us in Malaysia, where many races and many religions live together. "Political parties should live in harmony and treat each other equally; religions should live in harmony and treat each other equally." And now, religious followers account for over half of the world's population. Therefore, our teacher said that if religious followers take the lead, the world can gradually move towards peace and stability.

This has a lot to do with our everyday conduct. We must respect each other, learn from each other, and be tolerant of each other. We should also diligently learn the good teachings from these different races and religions, and praise each other when we talk. Then everyone will be happy, because you respect their scriptures and their sages. "Respect their father, and the son will be pleased; respect their elder brother, and the younger brother will be pleased; respect their ruler, and the subjects will be pleased." Respect Jesus, and the Christians will be pleased. Respect Allah, and the Muslims will be pleased. If you respect the classics of these religions, their followers will be happy. There is a teaching here from Hinduism, which is also about tolerance. It says, “A noble soul is one that dedicates itself to promoting peace and happiness in others.” Where is the nobility of the soul? “Dedicating itself to promoting peace and happiness in others.” They realize that this is the meaning of life. Helping others is the foundation of happiness. This is the meaning of life, “even if those people have harmed him.”

Interactions between people must be sincere. This is not a transaction. It is not that we should only be kind to those who are kind to us. This is how we should be as people. We should treat others with love and respect, and not change because of circumstances. If we change, then our hearts have changed. It is no longer true sincerity. There was a TV series, *The Legend of Master Physician Hsi Lai Le*, where he said, "Today a dog is injured. As a doctor, saving lives is my duty. I will cure that dog. One day it’s not in a good mood and it bites me. But then it falls ill again. Should I treat it or not?" This is what everyone should ask themselves. Loving and respecting others is our fundamental duty. How can we change because of their attitude? If we change, it means we are acting out of self-interest, not moral principle. Then all the years of studying the teachings of sages are for naught. We cannot distinguish between moral principles and self-interest. “A noble person is guided by morality; a petty person is guided by self-interest.”

There is another statement from Islam: "Speak justly when in hate or in joy; provide for those who cut ties with me; take care of those who are unkind to me; forgive those who treat me unfairly." Look at how great their tolerance is. When I read this, I think of what was said in *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons*: in the practice of benevolence, we must “begin with what is most difficult.” We must start by working hard at the most difficult aspects. This is not easy. When a person feels hate, they hold resentment toward another, but they still have to speak fairly. And when we like someone and we are happy, we still have to speak fairly. Our hearts must maintain fairness and equality at all times. This takes effort.

We must provide for those who cut ties with us. That’s actually the right thing to do. If they have cut ties with you, it’s not good to hold grudges. When they encounter difficulty, if you go to help them, won’t the matter be resolved? “Take care of those who are unkind to me.” Truthfully, there is no ill-will without some degree of love. Right? Would you go up to a stranger and say, “I’m going to cut ties with you?” They would think you were out of your mind. But then, looking back at Confucius’s saying, “Loving people, we want them to live; hating people, we want them to die.” When you like someone, everything about them is good and you want to help them in every way. When something happens and you start to dislike them, you find everything about them unpleasant, you might even curse them. Whether they are at fault is not the point. Our hearts have also become too extreme.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural reading flow:

**Translation:**

So, looking back, this severing of ties stems from our own love and hate. We are unhappy with their actions, and this love undergoes a kind of chemical change.

We should constantly reflect on Mencius's saying, “Seek to recover your lost heart.” Our true heart becomes lost when our attitude towards handling matters changes because of circumstances. Therefore, we need to “care for those who sever ties with us.” If they sever ties with me, I will not sever ties with them; if they are not at peace with me, I will be at peace with them; if they break off relations with me, I will not break off relations with them, maintaining my own true heart. “Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone.” In truth, their anger and resentment are always changing and not real. As long as you consistently treat them well, they will gradually realize that you are addressing the issue, not the person. If they are angry and you also look at them with disapproval, this resentment will only become more deeply entrenched.

“Forgive those who treat me unjustly.” These principles all seem interconnected. "What is wrong with others is also right." Their injustice to me is because they haven’t learned. "If people do not learn, they do not know righteousness.” How can we not forgive them because they have not learned? Would we not become overly critical if we did? We might then say, "But they *have* learned! They’ve been learning for ten years!" If they have learned for ten years and are still like this, isn’t that even more pitiable than not having learned at all? You see how a shift in perspective can bring about peace. Why is it so hard to shift? Because we are attached and because we create opposition. Because of this opposition, we don't put ourselves in their shoes, we don't think about their family background, we don’t think about their entire life’s journey, we don’t think about their possibly miserable future. If you look from the past and from the future, you won’t create opposition or harbor resentment towards anyone.

Finally, let me cite Hinduism. Hinduism says, “Forgiveness conquers anger.” This is all about tolerance. Christianity says, “Do not repay evil with evil.” This is what Christianity teaches. Do you remember a phrase we used when discussing “Tolerance” in our *360 Classics*? It’s also a teaching from Lao Tzu. Don’t look at the book, although I think I might have glanced at mine. Alright, I won't look for now. Let's all think together: "Repay grievances with kindness." Only in this way can we resolve conflict. So, did you see? I just made a big mistake. I saw that others were looking at their books, but didn't see that I had looked first. It’s always easier to talk about others. This concept of tolerance is found in various religions; it's a case of great minds thinking alike.

Eighth point: Be understanding. For example, if someone comes to you and says, "So-and-so said such-and-such about you," we should respond by saying, "Ah, they must have misunderstood. We get along very well. In the past, they have treated me very well.” The other person won't know what else to say. When these words reach the ears of the person who criticized us, they might feel awkward since they can’t clap with one hand alone, and may refrain from criticizing us again. Because you remember their good deeds, their conscience will be awakened by this attitude.

For instance, if someone makes a mistake or does something inappropriate, and others tell us about it, we could say, "Oh, they're probably too busy lately. Maybe something happened at home, maybe they’re carrying a heavy burden and simply forgot or overlooked something." This is being understanding. It might indeed be the case. Even if it isn’t, the other person will be moved upon hearing this and will feel ashamed. People are being so tolerant and considerate of me, so I need to be more cautious and thoughtful in the future. We often say, “Oh, they didn't mean to, they were just momentarily upset. Don’t take it to heart, don’t misunderstand them." This is all about being understanding.

Actually, this is protecting our own kind heart and the kind hearts of those around us. Otherwise, if someone's emotions are already flaring and we add fuel to the fire, things that were nothing will turn into something, and small things will become big things. This is being understanding.

Of course, there are many other aspects, including the "filial piety and brotherly respect" discussed in our *Essentials of Governance from the Classics*. This is also about how we conduct ourselves. Furthermore, this filial piety and brotherly respect not only means being filial to our parents and loving to our siblings, but should be extended to respect the parents and siblings of everyone: "Treat other's fathers as if they were our own, and treat other's elder brothers as if they were our own" and “All people are worthy of love”. We must always keep kindness, righteousness, duty, and benevolence in mind. The concepts of benevolence and righteousness are found in our *Classics*. We must treat people with sincerity and humility. I will conclude this part here. In fact, this topic has no depth and no bounds. All learning is actually inseparable from how we conduct ourselves, treat others, and interact with the world.

Next, let's look at how we approach tasks. What are some correct mental attitudes for doing things? First, we must have a very clear purpose for doing things. We shouldn’t be doing things for the sake of doing them. Many people get bogged down in tasks. The more they do, the more assertive they become, and the worse their temper gets. Those who follow them also fail to learn true virtue in dealing with people and affairs. When a person is assertive, the people around them will be influenced. They'll all start talking loudly and lacking in empathy. They end up in a bad place and those around them do as well. Is this the real purpose of doing things? Surely, we don’t want a situation where everyone becomes worse off after a task is completed? How should it be? Even if a task isn’t successful, everyone's spirit should be elevated and their wisdom increased.

If their spirit and wisdom are elevated, how can the task not be successful? “Things cannot always go as one wishes.” Many tasks require the convergence of many conditions, correct? If these conditions are not met, even if everyone has done their best, their capacity will still continue to grow. Therefore, even if a task doesn't seem successful on the surface, we cannot judge it based solely on results. “Do not judge heroes by their success or failure.” Confucius, whom we are all very familiar with, traveled the states for fourteen years and yet, throughout all his work, he was never appointed as an official in any state who could transform it into the model state of the Spring and Autumn period. It’s not that Confucius lacked the ability; rather, it’s that the people’s blessings were insufficient and the rulers of that time were too selfish. They didn't believe in selfless people and were afraid that Confucius would take their power away or steal their authority. With these doubts, how could they possibly have valued Confucius? Therefore, the right conditions were not present. However, Confucius had done his best, which was enough to reach his own fulfillment. His spirit lives on: “Knowing it cannot be done, but still doing it.”

In fact, two thousand five hundred years later, we should all emulate the spirit of Confucius. Besides, in these past two thousand five hundred years, has there been any sage’s disciple who hasn’t emulated Confucius’s spirit? Is it not true that many scholars have encountered chaotic times rather than peaceful ones? Consider Shi Kefa of the Ming Dynasty and Wen Tianxiang of the Song Dynasty. Despite the times, their unwavering loyalty to their country will last for all time. How can we judge heroes by their successes and failures? When we talk about loyal ministers, we immediately think of Zhuge Liang. Ultimately, he also failed to restore the Han Dynasty, but his devotion, "dedicating his energy to the task until his death," was complete.

Therefore, we must be clear about the real purpose of doing things. As *The Great Learning* begins, it speaks to the value of human life, “In illuminating virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in perfect goodness.” How does a person illuminate their virtue, love the people, and abide in perfect goodness? It is by practicing what one has learned, by using each person and situation one encounters, and by refining their heart in every task. King Shun met his parents, and ultimately, it was through that relationship that he developed his virtue and his utmost filial piety. Later, his blessings manifested and he became the emperor. He restored his illuminated virtue by refining himself in his relationship with his parents and recovering his true heart. Therefore, the purpose of doing things is to benefit ourselves and others. To benefit ourselves is to restore our illuminated virtue. It's not to engage in selfishness, which is like licking honey off a blade - it's a disaster, not a true benefit. True benefit is restoring immeasurable wisdom, virtue, and blessings. As our Executive Director often says, “Selflessness, seek within,”. That is, in every matter, we should let go of all selfishness. This is the purpose of doing things. "Oh, how come I can't control my temper when I do this? My desires and attachments are so strong." We use this situation to let go of our own negative tendencies. “In loving the people”, “loving the people” encompasses ordering the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven, working for the benefit of the people. This is the meaning of “courageous righteousness.”

If we are clear about our purpose, we won’t get trapped in the details of tasks, we’ll be able to maintain our rationality, we'll be able to clearly observe our own minds, and we can see the hearts of others when doing tasks. It is said, "When doing things, think about others; when judging others, think about yourself first." You see, isn't this attitude towards doing things for the benefit of both self and others? Why should we think of ourselves first when judging others? For example, if we are discussing someone's shortcomings, if we honestly reflect, we will likely find those same shortcomings in ourselves. We'd be too busy trying to fix ourselves than to judge others.

So, what are some of the principles we should follow when doing things? First, "focus on the root." We need to start from the fundamentals in any task. "The noble person focuses on the root. When the root is established, the Way will emerge." If we are only focusing on the branches and leaves, we will not be able to resolve the problem and would have put the cart before the horse. To achieve something great, where does one start from the root? Start from the heart, start from filial piety, start from self-cultivation. These are all attitudes of focusing on the root. Start from wisdom. Without wisdom, how can one do anything? Won’t it be counterproductive? Therefore, the “Twelve Principles for Youth” mentions “Learning is the root of benefiting the world”. To benefit the world, true learning is important. This learning isn’t about knowledge, it’s about wisdom. As it says, "To love learning is to come close to wisdom." The goal of this learning is wisdom, not the accumulation of knowledge. Confucius says in *The Analects*: “He recites three hundred poems," reciting the three hundred *Odes* by heart. He had studied for a long time. "Given a political appointment," but he is still "unable to manage it". "Sent on a mission," he is still "unable to make proper replies". He bungled the mission. "Though one learns so much, what is it good for?" Although he was familiar with the three hundred *Odes*, it was knowledge, not true learning.

When we study traditional culture, we need to be more mindful. We might spend a lot of time studying, but when we actually handle matters, we are unable to apply the principles we have learned. For example, we know that when doing things, we must be calm and composed. We must use stillness to manage movement, calmness to manage impatience, tolerance to manage narrow-mindedness, and slowness to manage haste. We all know these principles, but when we face an emergency, we become flustered and even put our shoes on wrong. Therefore, "the principle is understood instantly, but practice requires gradual cultivation." We still need much more experience and practice to gradually align understanding and action. As we experience more, we will realize our shortcomings and our understanding will deepen. We must also cultivate both compassion and wisdom. We must use our wisdom to act, for having the heart to benefit others. Otherwise, we’ll end up doing harm. Therefore, wisdom is very important. There is a saying, “A loving mother often spoils her son.” She loves her son, but ultimately destroys him. “Loving someone without the proper way can only cause harm.” She did not use her wisdom to teach him.

Next, another principle when doing things is to have "legitimate reasons and proper order." Everyone in a group or in a position should be given legitimate reasons and proper order to act. This is essential to performing their duties and leading others. If not, they will feel unsure, insecure, and may even be viewed with suspicion by others. When appointing an important officer, we need to think from their perspective and respect them. This concept of “legitimate reason and proper order” is especially important.

Another principle is that roles and responsibilities must be clear. When everyone is clear about this, chaos is avoided. If responsibilities are unclear, then three departments will be discussing whose job it is. Sometimes after someone does a task, another department may feel like they took their job away, and this leads to unnecessary conflict. Therefore, we need to have clear roles and responsibilities. "The noble person considers only matters within their realm." We should be thinking and doing our best within our own responsibilities. Don’t worry about or interfere in the responsibilities of others while our own responsibilities are unfinished. Of course, when we have fulfilled our own responsibilities and another department truly needs help, we can provide support. This is the meaning of "division of labor, not separation of family." All of these are very important principles for carrying out tasks.

Next, doing things should be in accord with human feelings, reason, and the law. Balancing these three aspects is often difficult. For example, during a training course once, a participant who had not registered flew in and wanted to attend the class. What would you do if you were in charge? Plane tickets are quite expensive. If you consider their feelings, you would open the door to others flying in to attend the course without registering. Therefore, we must follow the rules of the organization, while also being considerate of human feelings. We should treat him well for a few days, provide for his basic needs and education, and treat him like a guest. We can also send him recordings of the classes. So, we have done all we could to accommodate him, but we should not break the rules. Also, we should remind him that the most important thing he should learn from this trip is to always follow the rules wherever he goes, and not to be so impulsive. If he remembers this lesson, this experience will benefit him for his entire life. And, if he doesn’t understand, we can discuss it further.

When you are in charge, you'll encounter many situations, such as people trying to circumvent rules to get you to do something. What do you do? If you agree to help him, things will become even more complicated in the future. You might say, "I didn't get any benefit. I just did it out of sympathy." But you can't break the rules. So, you must have ways of handling these situations. Actually, circumventing rules is not beneficial to the person involved. Why? Because the opportunity wasn’t earned by the person himself, but rather, by his father or mother. Is this truly good for the child? He won't cherish it. So, you need to tell his parents that they are harming him by doing this. "I know that you did this out of good intentions for your child, as parents. I understand.” By showing that you understand, they might be more open to your reasoning. You have to smooth over the feelings and then talk to them about the principles involved. Since they feel like you understand them, they’ll be more open to accepting what you say. When you explain it like this, showing you were not doing it for yourself, but for him, they will usually accept it. Even if they are still stubborn and refuse to accept it, you can just smile and tell them, "It still won’t work."

Therefore, it’s important for the person in charge to adhere to the principles. So, what if they are angry with you? If they are angry, they will get over it in a few days. Don't be bothered by it. Why? It takes two to tango. If they are always angry with you, but you don’t get angry, eventually their anger will fade away. Besides, apart from that specific situation where you adhered to the principles, you should still buy him white coffee, and you should still brew Pu’er tea for him. I don’t believe that he can be angry for three years. I think that if he were angry for three years, he would be dead. No one is so foolish. He will eventually understand your attitude. Perhaps after a month or two, your persistence will have educated him.

There’s a great story that demonstrates how to balance these aspects. During the Tang Dynasty, there was a scholar named Zhang Zhenzhou, who was from Shuzhou. He was transferred from Shouzhou to Shuzhou to serve as the governor. It wasn't easy to go back to your hometown to serve as the governor, because you would have so many elders, relatives, and friends from the area. So, when he returned to his family home, he bought a lot of good food and drink, and gathered all of his relatives and old friends for ten days of feasting. And he timed it just right, because on the eleventh day, he was to begin his term. So, they feasted until the day before his term started. He even gave gifts of gold, silver, and silk to his relatives and friends. On the last day, as he was seeing them off, he said, "Today, we can all gather here happily. Tomorrow, I will be the governor of Shuzhou and will have to govern the people. There must be a distinction in etiquette between officials and commoners. Therefore, after tomorrow, I won't be able to spend my time with all of you as often. I have to handle all matters impartially. Even the prince is subject to the law, just like a commoner. I have to govern the people fairly and justly, and can't keep gathering with you as I've been doing." And with that he wept bitterly as he bid them farewell. The next day, he began his term and no longer associated with his relatives and friends. As a result, Shuzhou was very well governed. As word spread, all the people felt that he was very just, and respected him and complied with his leadership.

For someone from Shuzhou to be the governor of Shuzhou was very difficult. But, if he only followed the law and showed no consideration for human feelings, he would have hurt people’s feelings. If he only followed human feelings, he would have violated the law. The difficulty lies in this: hurting feelings is not proper. However, Zhang Zhenzhou was able to feast with his relatives and friends for ten days at his family home, giving them gifts of gold, silver, and silk. When the time came for parting, he respectfully explained the principles involved, and wept as he bid them farewell. His care for human feelings was very profound. He upheld the law, and acted with proper etiquette. Therefore, one must do everything with accord to human feelings, reason, and the law, doing one’s best without violating fairness or justice. By having a good grasp of this balance, one will not go too far astray.

Regarding the way we do things, there's another maxim: "When observing issues, focus on understanding principles. When handling issues, focus on an impartial heart.” These are principles for addressing any issue we may encounter. When we come across a situation, or issue, we must understand what the problem is and the important principles for handling the task. For example, when learning from *Essentials of Governance from the Classics*, a very important point is "When the right person is present, governance will rise. When the right person is absent, governance will cease." Therefore, choosing and using the right people is crucial when doing things. Including the many details of doing things, such as paying attention to the ethics of the organization, and not overstepping one’s authority in managing tasks. Otherwise, the officers will feel disrespected and distrusted. This will create a sense of distance, generate negative emotions, and prevent unity. Therefore, we must respect and consider other's feelings in all the details of our actions.

For example, at our center, we have lunch meetings with colleagues. They may bring up issues regarding their studies or work, which sometimes involves the way departments are doing things. In such cases, I cannot respond right away. I need to communicate with the head of that department first to make sure I understand the situation, and then let them handle it. I cannot overstep my authority. I cannot respond off the cuff, and then cause difficulties for them. Because sometimes the issues raised by colleagues are valid, but it’s only one perspective. Those in charge have to consider three or four perspectives. If we respond immediately without considering these other perspectives, then we are handling the situation improperly. This would be disrespectful to those in charge, while creating unrealistic expectations for the colleagues who had raised the issue. We would be in a no-win situation.

"When handling issues, focus on an impartial heart" is very important. When doing things, we should be fair and just, and not be swayed by personal gain or personal feelings when handling public affairs. If this is not achieved, the unfairness of people’s hearts will create the biggest obstacle for the organization. If people’s hearts are not at peace, how can unity be achieved?

Another maxim, which corresponds to "When observing issues, focus on understanding principles" is: "Public-mindedness brings clarity, sincerity brings clarity, and composure brings clarity." When we address issues, we should have a public mind, address issues with sincerity, and deal with situations calmly. With a public mind, we won't be hindered by our own selfish desires. With sincerity, we won't be mixed with deceitfulness. And with composure, we won't be flustered, but rather see the situation clearly and understand it better.

As I mentioned to you last time, we implement family culture, and the concept of the "public mind" is essential. If three or four hundred people live together, and everyone is thinking only of themselves and their children, how many factions will be created? Therefore, our ancestors were very wise. They knew that people are easily influenced by selfish desires. Therefore, they started with filial piety, allowing the innate closeness between fathers and sons to be maintained throughout life. As such, sons will always be thinking of their parents, and their selfish desires will not arise.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**The essence of family culture is selflessness; only without selfishness can family culture be truly implemented.**

Furthermore, there should be no secrets in family management, but rather honesty and equality. This concept of "public" is essentially about equality. Take the story of Zheng Lian from the Ming Dynasty's “Number One Family Under Heaven,” who smashed two pears into two water jars and gave everyone a cup of pear juice. This represented equality, and the people’s hearts were thus leveled.

Of course, family management must adhere to the “Six Harmonies”: “Shared Understanding in Views”—meaning everyone should have the same understanding of family rules and values; everyone should recognize the importance of family education; and everyone should be filial, diligent, frugal, and prudent. These are all key aspects of family management. This also includes the concept of not airing family scandals publicly, and everyone must fully understand this.

The other day, we met a CEO, and we analyzed the various chaotic issues arising from mind and body, family, society, and the world. There is such disorder. The number of civilization-related illnesses is increasing, as are mental illnesses that we had never heard of before. Conflicts within the five human relationships are rampant, including rising crime rates and fraud. Abortion is another issue; worldwide, 50 million abortions occur each year, a tragedy more devastating than any world war, and these are inflicted upon one's own flesh and blood. Such complex problems, at their root, are actually very simple: it is a problem of the human heart. The *Book of Documents* says, "Doing good brings down a hundred blessings; doing bad brings down a hundred misfortunes." All this chaos stems from the evil in people's hearts. Once we identify the root cause, we can find the cure. If we teach children filial piety from a young age, wouldn't this problem be resolved? "The former kings possessed supreme virtue and essential principles, which, when used to harmonize the world, brought peace and contentment to the people, and removed grievances between superiors and inferiors.” This is true; it is not a myth. If you employ filial piety, the world will be peaceful, because, from a fundamental perspective, it is not complicated at all. People’s hearts are consumed with the pursuit of profit and desire. Pursuing profit harms others, and indulging in desire ruins one’s body and spirit.

That CEO shared the education he received from his mother, which I found deeply touching. I believe the two things he shared could solve many of the world’s current problems. He’s from Guangdong, and he said his mother taught them: “When eating, watch the dishes.” This meant if there was less food, they should take less, leaving more for grandparents, their father, and elders who worked hard. If a person, from childhood, first thinks of their parents and grandparents when seeing delicious food, then their selfishness and desires are diminished, and perhaps even prevented from growing. We should not underestimate the power of this kind of everyday life education; it cultivates virtue and corrects shortcomings. He also said that his mother told them: "Buy clothes when they are on sale." This is frugality. Many current problems stem from self-indulgence, wastefulness, and a lack of frugality, which create all sorts of chaos. Therefore, these subtle lessons in life are very important. This frugality we're talking about also extends to how we value and cherish things.

“Shared Understanding in Views,” and further, “Shared Equality in Benefits.” In the Six Harmonies, do not distinguish whose money it is, but rather “Share Equality in Benefits.” This pertains to family businesses. In the past, when hundreds of people lived together, the women’s textiles would all be pooled together, with no distinction of ownership. There was even a family in the Ming Dynasty, the Zhang family, whose women were so united that if any child cried, whoever heard it first would breastfeed it, so children at one or two years old were sometimes confused about who their mothers were. This approach eliminates divisions. A person had dozens of mothers; hundreds of them lived together without distinguishing whose child was whose. This was "Shared Equality in Benefits."

"Shared Practice in Discipline"—families have rules and regulations, but also warmth and compassion. These principles must be applied in moderation; do not overdo it or fall short, be flexible and strict as needed. "Shared Dwelling in Body"—live together and prioritize others’ convenience, not just your own. "Shared Harmony in Speech"—be tolerant, yield, and don't argue over words. "Shared Joy in Intent"—share blessings and good fortunes; whatever good things happen, share them and enjoy them together. This "Shared Equality in Benefits" also implies sharing both blessings and hardships.

I mentioned earlier that these principles also apply to how we conduct ourselves: don’t overdo it or fall short. Like when entering a Buddhist temple, one first sees the Four Heavenly Kings. The Eastern King, who "Upholds the Nation," has the same principles as "upholding the family." He holds a lute in his hands, and the strings should neither be too loose nor too tight. This is to say when doing things, do not overdo it or fall short, but maintain balance and impartiality.

Okay, that is all I will share with you for this session. Thank you all!


Okay, here is a translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining the tone of the original:

**Lecture 23: The Importance of Self-Education: 4. Fulfilling Social Roles and Preserving Sincerity**

Respected elders and fellow students, good afternoon!

We will continue our discussion on the principles we should grasp when dealing with situations and undertaking tasks. For example, we talked about the importance of proceeding gradually, avoiding haste. We say that things follow their natural course; "a rope saw can cut through wood, water dripping will penetrate stone, water flows to form a channel, a melon ripens and falls." If we do not understand the principles of action, we often rush and worry, which only unsettles our hearts and provides no benefit. The development of any matter has a trajectory to follow, therefore, "the trends of the world develop gradually; the affairs of the world become stable through accumulation." Many situations require clear judgment and proper control. Moreover, when conditions are favorable, it is even more important for capable individuals to emerge, those who can enlighten and benefit a region.  These people must possess right knowledge and right views. However, such talent cannot be cultivated overnight, so when we look at the larger world, we can sense that the revival of Chinese culture under the guidance of Chinese leaders is an inevitable trend. We must understand that talent is hard to come by. First, we should expect more of ourselves. We must put in the effort to truly improve ourselves, so that when the opportunity arises, we are ready to be used by the country and the people. When it comes to learning, we must build a solid foundation, and then our abilities will flourish. If we do not diligently cultivate ourselves, when the opportunity comes, if we cannot resist temptations, as Mencius said, "wealth and rank cannot corrupt, poverty and humbleness cannot change, and power and force cannot subdue," then, instead of benefiting the world and reviving the culture, we become negative examples. This would be truly regrettable. Therefore, “From the emperor down to the common people, all must take self-cultivation as their foundation.”

We’re currently discussing the pursuit of knowledge, having previously used the example of Confucius to discuss learning and what it means to be a teacher. We won't elaborate further on that, but I'd like to share a few key points. The true benefit derived in the pursuit of knowledge does not depend on how long we’ve studied, but rather, "One part sincerity and reverence yields one part benefit, ten parts sincerity and reverence yields ten parts benefit." We must put effort into cultivating a sincere and reverent heart. Furthermore, Confucian learning, and the wisdom of traditional Chinese culture, emphasizes "diligent practice." "Extensive learning, careful questioning, thoughtful consideration, and clear discernment," these belong to the intellectual domain of learning. When combined with diligent practice, they become true wisdom. We must align understanding with action, so that our level of attainment rises, and true wisdom can flourish.

There's a saying that goes, "In learning and teaching, one or two parts of effort should be put into lectures and reading, and eight or nine parts of effort should be put into practice." Whether pursuing knowledge, or engaging in teaching, only one or two parts of our effort should be used for lectures, reading, or listening to lessons, while the majority of our effort, eight or nine parts, should be focused on actual practice.  A poem says, "The ancients exerted all their strength in learning, the efforts of youth became the achievements of age." We begin to engage with the classics in our youth, but "What one gains on paper always feels shallow, the true understanding comes only through personal practice." This means that to truly implement these teachings, we must put in a great amount of effort. As I’ve shared before, during the Ming Dynasty, Lord Xue Wenqing said that he had been working on managing his temper, the word "anger," for twenty years, and he still hadn’t completely subdued it. This tells us that self-mastery is not easy. To truly master and subdue our anger, we must constantly practice diligently and not relax even for a moment, thus "eight or nine parts of effort must be put into practice."

Additionally, when pursuing knowledge, we must have perseverance and not give up, just like drilling for fire. If you’re drilling for fire and your hand gets tired after two minutes, so you rest for 30 seconds, it will cool down, and the fire will not appear. Fire is like wisdom, if you stop and rest many times, it will be difficult to produce fire. Therefore, we must apply ourselves without interruption and without any slacking off. The ancients were so diligent that they didn’t even dare to relax in their dreams. If they had any improper behavior in a dream, they would repent upon waking up. This emphasizes the importance of moving forward gradually.

Next, when facing matters we must "assess our virtue and measure our ability, judge the situation, and choose the right people." We often say, “Do what is within your ability.” We must carefully assess if we have the virtue and ability required for a task.  It is said, "If something is inappropriate, do not lightly agree. If you lightly agree, you will face errors in action." In fact, when we carefully consider and refuse, we might actually earn the other party’s trust, because they will see that we are careful and don't agree lightly. But once we agree to something, no matter how difficult it is, we must do our best to accomplish it. This shows that the ancients were people of their word, evaluating carefully before agreeing, but once they did, they would give everything they had to accomplish it.

Regarding "judging the situation," sometimes a situation has not yet formed, and we cannot force it. For example, even if it's a good thing, but the law does not permit it yet, if you do it anyway, you could end up violating national regulations, and the negative consequences of that will be significant. "Judging the situation" is crucial. This leads to another saying, “Before doing something, you must first consider its potential harm, and then its potential benefit.” We must consider all aspects of a situation, not just the benefits. We must consider the possible negative impacts.  The ancients emphasized that when thinking about things, "We must not consider the immediate impact but the long-term consequences, not the temporary impact but the distant impact, and not the individual impact but the impact on the world." For example, if we are studying traditional culture, but what we are doing goes against the law, people will then say that those who learn traditional culture do not obey the law, the negative impact is immense. Sometimes people start offering courses without proper approvals, which is also very inappropriate. It is appropriate to do things in a legitimate way. We should not be impatient when doing good, and we should remain calm.

In "Liaofan's Four Lessons," it says that when Lü Dongbin learned from Han Zhongli, Han Zhongli taught him how to "turn stone into gold.” When he tapped the stone, it immediately turned into gold which could be used to help people. Was this good? "First consider the harm." Lü Dongbin calmly asked, "Will this gold ever revert back to stone?" Han Zhongli replied, "It will turn back in 500 years."  Lü Dongbin said, "Then wouldn’t I be harming people in 500 years? This isn’t the right way to do this." Han Zhongli said, "To become a celestial being, one must accumulate 3000 good deeds. With that one thought, you have completed 3000 good deeds." This is because even considering the people 500 years in the future, his heart and mind were vast.

Similarly, our current undertaking of promoting traditional culture comes at a time when it has been neglected for the past two hundred years, a time of revival and opportunity. There's a saying, "To benefit living beings through cautious action, the Tao’s influence will grow daily." Confucius has influenced us for over 2500 years. In his time, he had seventy-two disciples and 3000 followers, and it wouldn't have been difficult for him to cause a revolution. So why didn’t he? He understood the negative consequences that would come from it. Therefore, when judging the current situation, the revival of the entire culture will not happen in two or three years. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." It takes decades to cultivate a single person, so how can the revival of the entire Chinese culture be accomplished without three or five generations of dedicated work?

Moreover, "haste makes waste." The current focus on traditional culture has been primarily on promotion. Many people have not studied the classics or heard these lectures, and they may not even be able to explain the Five Relationships or the Eight Virtues. When they first encounter the classics and the lectures, they exclaim, “Wow, this is great!” This has the effect of sowing seeds. Once the seeds are sown, what’s next? They need fertilization and watering, and they cannot be harvested tomorrow. Therefore, it's important to establish an environment where long-term learning can occur. How can people become sages overnight? Is there a local TV station playing these teachings? Are educational institutions continuously teaching them? Therefore, after the "promotion period," we need to move into a long-term “root-taking period” in which virtuous conduct can be deeply rooted and classics can be practically applied in our daily interactions and responsibilities.

How long does the "root-taking period" last? We mentioned earlier that one person spent twenty years battling the single word "anger." This shows that self-mastery is not easy, so we must not be impatient and must first put in the effort to work on ourselves. "Self-cultivation" is required before we can “manage the family,” so that our own families and workplaces can then "demonstrate the teachings for others." Only when the roots are firmly planted can the branches and leaves flourish. We need to understand this, or else we might feel that simply offering courses is promoting culture, but if no one is implementing them, then people will say, "These lecturers only talk about it, but they don’t do it themselves." If this happens, then will people still want to learn? And this would not be benefiting living beings with a cautious approach, and how would the influence of the Tao grow?

Well then, truly taking root is not easy. It requires letting go of our habits, like our love of face, which is like peeling off a layer of skin. Confucius said, "To learn and practice what you have learned from time to time, is this not a pleasure?" Why would it be painful? When we peel off that layer, we are no longer controlled by it or by our desires. That's where the happiness lies. But when you are peeling that layer, what does it feel like? Of course, it’s painful.

For example, we’ve all had the experience of saying or doing something wrong, and when others correct us, our attitude may not be very happy.  Our initial reaction is to push back, but then you suddenly recall, “We should fear praise and rejoice in criticism,” so you swallow your words. If, after reading this, you immediately bow respectfully to anyone who offers you correction, then I will truly bow to you three times to show my great respect. We are all accustomed to wanting to look good. Throughout my own learning experience, I have compared myself to others on grades, and have slowly become a person who loves face. The first reaction I have when someone criticizes me is that I am not happy. However, the "Rules for Students" teaches differently, so you have to immediately adjust your attitude. “Initially, it’s forced, but eventually it becomes natural.” How can anyone immediately accept criticism with joy? That isn’t the norm; it could be only someone like Yan Hui reborn who does not repeat mistakes, someone who accepts it and changes immediately when someone points it out.

Next, regarding the points we just discussed, "benefit others with caution, the Tao’s influence will grow daily" and "first consider the harm, then its potential benefit," there's a very important principle to remember: “Don't seek merit, but seek to avoid mistakes”.  We should be cautious and apprehensive. Why don’t we seek merit? It's because it is the duty of every Chinese descendent to strive for the best, so we don't seek to claim that effort for ourselves. At the same time, we do fear doing anything that might stain the reputation of traditional culture. We do not want to do this, and so we must be even more cautious. Therefore, caution is an important key to doing things well. If we are not cautious, problems will inevitably arise sooner or later. We must be able to maintain success. Caution is important. We must be vigilant in times of peace and prevent potential problems before they happen.

Furthermore, when facing various situations, for example, "It's appropriate to do slow tasks quickly." If a task is not urgent, perhaps something for next week or next month, we must still allocate time and actively do it. “Doing it quickly” here means we must arrange the steps well and get started right away, so we won't be caught "cramming at the last minute."  We often tend to procrastinate when things are not urgent, wasting time, and then when it is almost due, we stay up all night to get it done. In this way, first, the quality of work is poor, and secondly, it damages our health. This is not a sustainable approach. So it’s said that, “It’s appropriate to do slow tasks quickly, quickness brings success; it’s appropriate to do urgent tasks slowly, in haste we make more mistakes.” I chose these particular sayings because I often fall into these patterns, and I wanted to share them with you to remind myself.

With regards to "it is appropriate to do slow tasks quickly," we should stay busy during our free time. When things are not so urgent, we can improve our virtue and ability, and arrange tasks in an orderly manner.  Now, we tend to only want to learn when we have tasks, and then when we have nothing to do, we get caught in daydreams and are unable to put in the effort to be present. If we cannot stay rooted in our present state, it is difficult to make progress in either our work or self-cultivation. With “it is appropriate to do urgent tasks slowly,” if a task is urgent, first we must calm our mind. If we become agitated, we cannot control our hearts, words, or actions. How are we then able to handle the task properly? It’s bound to get worse. The heart needs to be calm and still. It is not easy to quiet the human heart. Desires must be reduced, attachment to gains and losses must diminish, and we must have fewer things weighing on our minds. How can we focus when so many things are weighing on us, when something happens?

Looking at these sayings, you can see that the ancients were very accomplished in their self-cultivation. These were not the results of a day or two. They were the result of continuous practice and self-improvement. When we don't have anything to do, we should be wary of being "lazy." When there are no tasks, we tend to daydream and get lost in useless thoughts, wasting time. When we have tasks, we must be wary of being "disordered".

The scholar Liu Niantai said that if a person who has studied the teachings of the sages is unable to respond properly to a situation, becomes flustered, and confused, it's always due to some deficiency within the mind. So, where is the issue with the mind? He continues to explain that in facing matters, we should always focus on "cultivating the mind," and that we cultivate the mind through all our experiences. We do not "cultivate the matter", and that the heart is fundamental. How do we cultivate the mind? "The core principle is to have nothing on your mind." When our hearts are clear and there is nothing that troubles it, then we can see things clearly. Therefore, we are working to purify our hearts, to be able to see through things and let go. When our hearts are “empty of concerns,” they are like a clear mirror which can reflect everything without distortion. And like the surface of a calm lake, “still water reflects the vast world”; we can clearly see everything around us. But what happens when the lake is full of waves? Nothing is clear, and we are all confused.

The ancients used these examples to remind us that we must calm our minds to have wisdom, and to be able to handle situations calmly and properly. Therefore, it is said, when the light moves, it cannot illuminate objects; when water moves, it cannot reflect objects; the surface of the water cannot reflect clearly. The human mind is the same way; when it is agitated and disturbed, then "all reason is obscured".  When people become agitated, which scriptural saying can they recall? We have seen that when people are emotional, if you talk with them, they can say twenty or thirty sentences, and if you ask them, "of those sentences you spoke, not one of them is what the masters taught, or what's in the classics", they become confused and unable to think clearly; they only follow their emotions.  When they can calm themselves, and when their afflictions can be subdued, then their wisdom can then illuminate their minds and see the entire situation objectively.  So, every single day, the word “calm” is essential, every moment. If it leaves, the mind starts to become disordered, the heart will become chaotic.

There are some interesting analogies here. Doors open and close every day, but the door hinges remain still. "The hinges remain still." Also, beautiful and ugly things come and go in front of a mirror, but the mirror remains still. "The mirror remains still." We too, must not allow our hearts to be disordered or affected by the things we encounter. "People respond to different circumstances every day." We encounter different connections; our encounters are not for drinking or socializing, but to interact with different connections in a peaceful way. Only when our hearts are still can we move with grace and clarity, without fluster, or doing things we will regret later. If we allow our hearts to be affected by events, if our thoughts are disturbed and confused, we will not be able to see things clearly. Even when sleeping, if our minds are not at peace, we will have confused dreams. Do you all have this experience? When you’ve got many tasks weighing on you, you even dream about those tasks. The human mind is so active, and we don’t even realize how many random thoughts rise and fall within a single minute.

Therefore, we need to always keep our minds from random thoughts and be rooted in a state of peace. This is not easy. If you don’t believe me, try it: try not doing anything for three days, with your leader's permission of course. For three days do nothing and just try to calm your mind. Can you really do it? Let's say we sent you to a temple. Starting today, you will live at the temple, where you will have the morning bell and evening drum. You wanted to calm your mind, didn't you? Okay, starting today you will no longer go home, and you will live in the temple, with the morning bell and evening drum accompanying you into sleep. Can you accept it? The thoughts will immediately rise up like a flood: where’s my wife? Where’s my son? We don’t realize how chaotic our thoughts are because we’re always busy and rushing, but if we really want to be still, it is not that easy.

Therefore, when a person tries to become still, they will feel that there are many random thoughts. At this time, what do we need? We must use reason to subdue our emotions, using the principles of the sages to tame our minds. "Do not fear thoughts arising, only fear awareness coming too late." All the thoughts we have are about the past, the present, and the future. The past is already gone, we must let it go; the future hasn’t happened, don't worry about it; and for the present, don't fret, and just do our best according to the principles and with all our hearts. You can see that, under the teachings of our mentors and the classics, we slowly tame these random thoughts, and they will slowly become less. When we apply these teachings with right mindfulness, our hearts will be filled with the joy of the Dharma and not confusion. Therefore, calming the mind is also a gradual process. One cannot simply say, “Okay, I’ll shut myself in for a month.” You have to have skill for that, or else you might develop a mild form of mental illness. If we lock you up for a week, you’ll say, “Quick, find someone to talk to, I can’t take it anymore, I’m about to explode.”  Many things that we have not experienced, we assume are easy, but “It is only after experiencing it that we realize its difficulty.” You might admire those who shut themselves off for a week or a month, but that is not easy.

We were just talking about how to cultivate the mind. We must have nothing on our minds, for it is only then when our minds are clear that we can "do everything well." This has a lot of meaning.  For example, if you haven't let go of something that is bothering you, and then someone else comes to talk to you, you can’t truly hear them. Or if you have a bias toward someone, you’ll start to listen to what they say with suspicion and criticism. How are you then able to properly deal with that matter? Therefore, you must see the depth of these teachings for yourself in how you interact with others, and in your own actions.  We must constantly let go of our worries, random thoughts, and habits. "This is where the effort of mastering the stillness of the mind becomes effective." Only when we have mastered “having nothing on our minds” will our efforts become effective.

"In handling matters, the greatest mistake is haste." So, we cannot be disorganized. As we mentioned before, "in haste, we make more mistakes." We must avoid “disorderliness when we face tasks." “In handling matters, the greatest mistake is haste; with haste, one doesn't even have time to take care of oneself."  How, then, are they able to "manage matters?" So first, “the most important aspect of learning is to calm and eliminate our agitation.” Why are there so many things in our mind, so many thoughts? It is because we cannot subdue our greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt. I talked about this in our previous lessons, in which we emphasized "being strict with ourselves," and we must tame these afflictions. For example, if we are very attached to wealth, fame, food, sleep, and beauty, then our minds will be full of random thoughts all the time, how can they then possibly be calm? So, we must let go of gains and losses, let go of our desires, and let go of these attachments. That is very important.

Furthermore, there are four important words: "slowly, things will be resolved." We want to help people and do things well, but we often end up making a mess of things. Have you had this experience? When a husband and wife fight, or when friends fight, and we try to be the peacemaker, we only make it worse, and we get pulled in and end up getting angry ourselves. This is all a test of our cultivation and ability to handle matters. The saying "slowly, things will be resolved," means that often, as we listen to others speak, our emotions get pulled along. For example, as they speak, they might bring us into the conversation, and our emotions are triggered, or we only listen to one side of the story. We have also encountered the same situation when a couple is in conflict, and when we listened to the husband, the wife was unreasonable; when we listened to the wife, the husband was unreasonable. Sometimes when we listen to the two of them, it’s strange how the exact same event can have completely different explanations. One reason is that they have different perspectives, but what is more important is that everyone’s ego is strong, and so they are very subjective in how they see the situation. Actually, if both sides give such different accounts of the situation, then it’s likely that neither side is completely objective. Unless you are familiar with one’s cultivation, and know that they do not lie, then it is easy to have your emotions take over how you see things and how you describe them.

So, what should we do at this time? “If you think things through carefully, you can get the facts; if you act slowly, you will do it properly."  This is excellent advice. "Slowly, things will be resolved." If we "think carefully," understand and contemplate all aspects, then we can discover the truth. We will then be able to correctly judge the situation. Therefore, when listening to others, we must first remain calm. If we can see where they are speaking with emotion, we can point it out. Then because of our experience, we will be able to judge their honesty, and we can gain a more objective understanding. “If you think things through carefully, you can get the facts,” the true nature of the situation will become clear.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural reading flow:

**Title: Handling Matters with Deliberation**

"Handling things slowly" means understanding the situation clearly before acting. Otherwise, your actions might lead the other party to feel misunderstood or wronged, intensifying their negative emotions. Therefore, it's best to proceed deliberately. After gaining an objective understanding, first acknowledge what they did correctly and affirm their good intentions. Perhaps their methods are simply not easily understood. Approaching the discussion in this way – "deliberate handling achieves appropriateness" – allows for a more calm and measured approach, leading to a more proper resolution. Sometimes, if we act impulsively based on only one side of the story, criticizing or scolding, we end up making things worse. However, after fully understanding all sides, you can better assess each person's attitude and intentions, gaining clearer insight. This allows you to then mediate relationships, illuminate moral principles and practical wisdom, and inspire positive thoughts in everyone.

Furthermore, when handling matters, “words should not be spoken to their fullest extent, and actions should not be done to the extreme.” Knowing the right measure in all things is crucial. Don't take all the credit for good deeds. You should know when to stop, gracefully withdrawing after achieving success, avoiding the temptation to linger for personal fame and gain, which ultimately leads to defamation. To foster a positive trend, do not seek to be the leader or the first in line. These are important attitudes when handling affairs. Let others participate in good deeds, and never do anything to the extreme.

We once encountered someone who took "doing to the extreme" to both ends. They would either prevent others from doing good deeds or push bad actions too far. As the saying goes, "Those who repeatedly commit unrighteous acts will inevitably destroy themselves." An official named Xi Xiandu, who was in charge of engineering projects, would not allow workers to rest during the sweltering summer, and he would demand work continue even in the freezing winter when it was impossible. Many could not endure such mistreatment and committed suicide. Because he lacked compassion for the people, he was eventually executed. Those who act in such a way are bound to create many problems and face severe consequences.

Similarly, there was a prison official who was very strict with his subordinates. If someone was late on an assignment by one day, they would receive five strokes of the heavy paddle. One of his subordinates was six days late. Knowing that thirty strokes could kill him, he asked the official if the punishment could be administered in installments. However, the official was unyielding and pushed the matter to the extreme. He refused and had all thirty strokes applied at once, killing the man. He had been merciless towards his subordinate. When the news of his death reached the man’s family, his son died of shock, and his wife committed suicide after losing her husband and son. All because of one harsh act, three lives were lost. You would think the official might learn from this, but he remained unchanged.

Therefore, self-reflection is extremely important. Without it, even the greatest blessings can be squandered. Consider that this official, despite his cruelty and the death of three people, still held his position – which, in itself, is a significant blessing. If a person lacks blessings, taking lives could cost them their own. But some, blessed with power, can kill with impunity and still remain emperors. Though people’s blessings may differ, doing things to the extreme will surely diminish them. Soon after returning to his hometown with his only son, this official fell ill. His son’s condition worsened, and while sick, the boy cried out, “Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!” as if someone were trying to take his life. The boy eventually died, and the father, grieving deeply, soon followed him to the grave. Hence, “actions should not be done to the extreme.”

Bad actions should not be taken to the extreme, and good deeds should be shared with others. I remember once we went out to eat, and when it came time to pay, three of us headed to the cashier. One person forcefully pushed the other two aside, insisting, “I’ll pay!” When the other two returned, their faces were obviously upset. It would have been much better if we had just said, “Let’s all split the bill,” wouldn't everyone have been happy? Why be so attached to your own way of doing things? Thus, good deeds should not be pushed to the extreme, everyone should share, and then gracefully step aside, promoting positive trends. You shouldn’t do good deeds and then constantly tell everyone, "I did this first! I was the first one!" As they say, “Originally there is nothing; where can dust alight?" It is not easy.

“Words should not be spoken to their fullest extent.” Sometimes, when advising someone, it's best to hint rather than be overly explicit. If you push too hard, their initial pleasure can quickly turn into anger, undoing your previous efforts. Of course, if your words are gentle, and you notice that your words are already causing a frown, you should immediately "sound the retreat" and stop talking. Know when to stop, which is key in the art of communication.

Furthermore, “when breaking ties, do not utter harsh words.” It’s best for relationships to end well. Meeting with joy only to end up in a fight, such that you become strangers upon the next encounter, is a great pity. It is better to ensure a good beginning and end. When it is time for relationships to end, do so with joy, because twenty years later you might meet again and have a positive new beginning. If the end of the relationship was unpleasant, a weight will likely linger in your heart. Perhaps even the other person is cursing you, which will affect your well-being. Therefore, approach all matters and relationships with the attitude of forming good connections, never creating animosity or resentment. This is crucial for a successful life.

Next, let’s discuss the appropriate attitude and mindset towards handling matters. The principles we covered previously guide our actions. What is the correct attitude? “Fear not problems, but do not provoke them.” A person’s fear of assuming responsibility means they fear problems. Therefore, one must maintain a sense of public duty and a desire to benefit all. Then, they can bravely take on responsibility. Furthermore, even when facing criticism or misunderstanding, they should stand firm and argue their case, because they must be responsible to the public and the people. They accept the criticism of a few. “Though others do not recognize my efforts, I will not resent it,” they say. “How can one ever please everyone? I seek only a clear conscience.” They would even risk their life for the sake of the world. You have to understand that during the Ming Dynasty, when Hai Rui went to meet the Emperor, he had already purchased his coffin. When he offered his advice, the Emperor flew into a rage. “Does he not wish to live?” he asked. His officials replied: “He has already bought his coffin.” This made the Emperor less angry. We see such examples of loyal ministers giving outspoken criticism throughout history. Fan Zhongyan gave outspoken criticisms several times, risking his life each time, and was demoted to remote locations. He had already accepted his death as a possibility, and had instructed his descendants to establish a school next to his tomb, continuing to benefit the world, regardless of the consequences he might face.

Of course, although we should not fear problems, we should not act based on personal animosity. Once, during the Song Dynasty, an official became a Prime Minister. Fan Zhongyan produced a chart showing officials that many had been appointed based on their connections to the Prime Minister. Upon seeing the report, the Prime Minister rallied his forces to defame Fan Zhongyan, who was then demoted to a distant post. However, the Prime Minister was soon dismissed due to other issues. Later, Emperor Renzong reinstated Fan Zhongyan and also reappointed the Prime Minister. Emperor Renzong urged Fan Zhongyan to let go of past grievances. Fan Zhongyan emphasized that when he had submitted the chart of officials, he had acted on matters of principle, without holding personal animosity or creating conflict. Those who study the teachings of the sages “are invincible through their benevolence.”

Furthermore, do not provoke issues. “To create problems where there are none is a sign of diminished blessings,” because such actions inevitably deplete one's good fortune. Therefore, when handling matters, we should strive to resolve big issues into small ones, and small issues into nothing. Furthermore, if we have a magnanimous heart, we should be open, honest, and willing to let go of past grievances. Let bygones be bygones; do not hold onto them, so that we can all work together with a fresh perspective. If we are without fault, we should still foster such an approach. If we are in the wrong, we should apologize first and admit our mistakes. This will help establish an atmosphere of honesty. If we fail to resolve the situation, we will lose mutual trust, creating a divide, making it impossible to achieve anything.

The second point regarding our attitude is “wholehearted reverence and caution.” When handling all affairs, be reverent towards everyone and everything. What else is embodied in this reverence? When spending money, especially if you are a public servant, be responsible to the state and the people. This is also an expression of reverence. To be able to save even a small amount means you are working for the public good. Public servants should feel that they are earning the salary paid to them. If Mr. Fan Zhongyan felt that he had not performed his duties fully, he could not sleep at night, and he would go to work early the next day in order to compensate for his omissions, feeling at peace only after correcting the mistake.

This reverence and caution are also expressed in the concept of finishing as well as you start. Beginning well is crucial, because people are strongly affected by first impressions. For instance, a good start is half the battle. You have to raise morale, and “be cautious in beginning.” Good impressions directly affect how others trust us. This is only human nature. Therefore, a unit’s reception department is very important. When anyone arrives, they will first encounter the reception staff. If these staff are smiling, warm, and reverent, they will establish good connections from the start with everyone. However, if you put someone who cannot even smile and appears as though people owe him money in a position to receive the public, it will be problematic... You should use such a person for handling finances instead. That person’s face will make others want to take a shortcut. Upon seeing him, they'll think "Never mind." You must place people where their strengths can be utilized.

Including every connection, if they can receive sound advice and correct guidance at the beginning, and can establish the proper attitude, their path will be more complete, and they will likely thrive. For example, a person going to college should first establish the proper mindset for the four years ahead. They should not waste their time. Some college students are led astray by older students, who tell them: "University means you have four years to play." They are misled from the start and therefore ruined. I was told this myself by my upperclassmen, but I do not blame them because my resolve was not strong enough, and I had the seed of wanting to play, and so when I encountered the conditions, it was easy for me to stray. Thus, "If you find you are not acting correctly, then reflect on yourself." I must repent that I made a mistake. How do I repent? By advising all college students not to repeat my mistakes. Thus, those who are older, when their younger siblings or later generations are about to go to college, should tell them, “During these valuable four years, you must improve your moral character and abilities. When you graduate, you will be able to repay the kindness of your parents and the nation.” When you impress that sense of gratitude upon their hearts, they will feel that they must improve themselves, and they will not waste those four years.

Our ancestors also clearly understood the importance of “being cautious in the beginning.” Therefore, in the coming-of-age ceremony, the young person was made aware of their responsibilities and proper attitudes as an adult. Through this ceremony, their body and mind were composed. The wedding ceremony is also very important and solemn, and the entire process awakens one to a sense of responsibility. It is not a game. It is “to honor the ancestors in the ancestral temple and to continue the family line.” Marriage is the most important event for a society and a nation. Whether or not a nation will have talented people, whether society and families will have talented people, depends on the relationship of the couple. A harmonious couple can naturally produce sage-like offspring.

Okay, regarding this attitude of reverence and caution, do not be too eager for success. This, too, is an expression of caution. “Do not seek haste, do not seek small gains. Seeking haste leads to failure; seeking small gains prevents the achievement of great goals.”

Third, in how we approach our affairs, we should firmly believe in cause and effect. Deep faith in cause and effect will make a person incorruptible and honest, as they know that greed leads to misfortune. This concept of cause and effect means that good actions lead to good results and bad actions lead to bad results. There are numerous examples throughout history. During the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, there was a kind-hearted man named Yin Keng. One day, while dining with friends, he saw that the service staff was very tired, serving food and drinks. He suddenly took a cup of wine and some good food and offered it to one of the servers. His friends laughed at him, asking, "What are you doing?" He replied, "He may have served countless people, without ever tasting the wine himself. Since he is poor, we should offer him a cup." The server was very touched and drank the wine. Later, during the Hou Jing Rebellion in the Liang Dynasty, Yin Keng was surrounded by bandits. His life was in danger when suddenly, a man appeared and fought off the bandits, saving Yin Keng’s life. Disoriented from the experience, Yin Keng quickly asked him, "Brother, we are not related, why did you risk your life to save me?” The man replied, "I am the one to whom you offered a cup of wine. I remembered your kindness, and since I was here, I returned the favor.”

Thus, we should offer food to others generously. Throughout history, countless examples exist, where simply by offering a meal, people have had their lives saved, as Zhao Dun did in the Spring and Autumn period. He invited someone to eat, and eventually that person helped him escape from danger. Therefore, we must foster good relationships. If there is no repayment, it is simply because the time is not yet right. When you are in danger, or in need of assistance, the positive karmic results will appear. If you are going through a crisis, and no one is willing to help, do not get angry. Look within yourself, as it is likely you have not fostered positive relationships with others.

This firm belief in cause and effect should extend even to our thoughts. Even a bad thought can produce severe negative consequences. There was once a scholar, who was about to pass the imperial examination, but because he thought that his wife was not pretty enough and that he would replace her once he returned home, he failed the exam, losing his good fortune because of a single thought. Moreover, the most serious harm to one's virtue is a lack of filial piety. There was a scholar, who was extremely knowledgeable but could not pass the examination. A wise man told him that he had once glared at his father, and therefore had diminished his blessings. Of course, if he were to sincerely repent from the depths of his heart, I believe that he could change his fate. But these examples show us that one must not have even a single bad thought. You should cultivate good thoughts, and these good thoughts should be for the benefit of the people. Just like in the example of Wei Zhongda, because his one thought was for the benefit of the people, the power of that single good thought overcame his forty years of bad karma. Its power was enormous.

This cause and effect also includes the idea that those who fail to fulfill their responsibilities must face the consequences. “If a father does not educate his son, it is his fault; if a teacher is not strict, it is his laziness.” Do not think that since you have not done anything bad, you will not have any negative consequences. Failing to fulfill your duties is doing wrong and therefore, you will be held accountable. In ancient times, people understood that if you recommended someone who then caused harm to the nation, you, as the recommender, should resign, because you were not worthy of your duty to the nation. If the emperor ordered that you must remain and serve the state, then of course, you would have to obey, and you still would be punished by the state, or demoted. Therefore, fulfilling our ethical duties is the path to accumulating merit, while failing to fulfill our duties diminishes our blessings. Failing to fulfill our responsibilities is in fact being unfilial to our parents and not respecting the teachings of the sages and our teachers. In reality, people who do not truly put their efforts into things are diminishing their blessings. Why? Because they are squandering the teachings of the sages and their teachers. How could they not diminish their blessings? The greatest fields of merit that we possess are our filial devotion to our parents and our respect for our teachers. And respect for our teachers is embodied in our practice and adherence to their teachings.

Another important attitude when handling matters is to not be emotional, which means "do not criticize, but bravely take responsibility." Once something has occurred, criticizing and losing your temper will not help. Let bygones be bygones. We have previously reviewed a saying, which, very insightfully stated, that: "Apart from self-reflection and doing your best, there is no other principle in this world." Self-reflection means examining yourself. Was there anything wrong with my attitude? Was there anything I should have reminded others to do? Did I fail to exert my full effort? Reflect on yourself. And then, now that things are as they are, what can I do to fix this situation? Is there something I can do to improve things? A person who constantly reflects on themselves, and does their best, will not waste time on criticism or anger.

Furthermore, one must strive for expertise when doing something. “If you wish to be highly skilled, you must be able to grind an iron bar into a needle,” that is, you must focus and strive. You should not try to learn a bit of everything, doing everything in a sloppy manner. It is like digging wells. If you dig ten wells without reaching water in any of them, it is better to focus on digging a single well deep enough to reach water. Therefore, focus and concentration are extremely important. “Regardless of the size of a task, without dedication, there will be no precision; regardless of the type of work, without familiarity, there will be no skill.” Practice makes perfect. The Germans excel at this, with many companies focusing on a single product for hundreds of years, achieving such a deep understanding that no one can match their skill.

Furthermore, one must have perseverance. "Every day you walk, you need not fear ten thousand miles; if you do things constantly, you need not fear ten thousand tasks." Perseverance is the foundation of success. “Nothing is impossible under the sun, it only depends upon the will of the person.” When undertaking a task, do not cling or force matters. If the right conditions arise, give your best. If the right conditions are not present, improve yourself, and then put in effort when the time is right. If the conditions are at seven out of ten, give seven parts of your effort; if the conditions are at three out of ten, give three parts of your effort. To give seven parts of your effort when the conditions are only at three out of ten is to cling or force matters; to give three parts of your effort when the conditions are at seven out of ten is to be irresponsible and careless. You must assess the situation and grasp the correct measure. However, if you put in three parts of your effort with conditions at three, gradually, the conditions will develop, and people will trust you, thinking you understand how to apply the correct measure. Conditions will continually develop in a more auspicious manner. Here is a very good motto: “If you do not reflect upon yourself, you will not see all your own ailments”; that is, you cannot see your flaws if you do not reflect upon yourself. And “If you are impatient, you will not accomplish anything”; patience is also a very important quality for success.

Also, a very important attitude is to always have the bigger picture in mind when handling things. A motto states, “When taking on challenging tasks,” you must “be willing to exert effort without generating anger.” If something is already difficult, you should be the one to take the lead, to encourage everyone to participate, invest their effort, and sacrifice for the cause. You must be willing to exert the effort without generating anger. If the matter is already difficult, and we get angry or have conflict with others, will that not further complicate matters? Those who truly see the bigger picture will not add any additional difficulty. “When interacting with difficult people,” who have a fiery personality, you should be “understanding without being judgmental,” meaning that, through wisdom, you should understand their situation and be tolerant, but you should not criticize them behind their backs. If you do so, and the words get back to them, it would never end. Thus, being able to see the bigger picture is an important attitude.

Lastly, let’s discuss our attitude toward material objects. First and foremost, cherish all lives, because “Heaven is benevolent and cherishes life.” We must not harm any life unnecessarily. We should teach our children from a young age to cherish life, and to subdue their desire to kill, and in so doing, they will become compassionate. If we teach them to respect material things, they will not waste things, and will become frugal. They will learn frugality, which helps to cultivate integrity and subdue greed. Therefore, our ancestors wisely taught their children not to harm any life, for example: "Love for mice means to leave food out for them, compassion for moths means to not light lamps." You might ask: "What if there are too many insects in the house?" Remove whatever attracts them and leave food out for them and communicate with them with sincerity. It will be fine. I have shared before that during our visit to Yunnan, we saw one thousand acres of pears, where one section was left for the insects and birds to eat, and they only ate from that section. Furthermore, they ate with great manners. When I went to look at the trees where the fruit had been eaten, I saw that the insects ate only a single part of the fruit very thoroughly and didn't touch the rest of the fruit or the fruit on the other trees. Those insects and birds were well-mannered; when they saw that a piece of fruit was already half-eaten, they would eat what was left and not touch any other. And seeing other insects touching new fruit, they must have felt: "You are so ill-mannered! People are so kind to us, you should have better ethical behavior." Why? Because it ate the same fruit. The other good fruit can still be sold. Therefore, all living beings are interconnected, and will respond to you with sincerity. If you are sincere to them, they will be kind to you.

Regarding material objects, like food, “For every bowl of porridge, every meal, consider how difficult it was to obtain; for every thread of silk, reflect upon the effort involved in its making." Behind every object there might be a great deal of people’s blood and sweat. And when we eat vegetables, people may have even harmed other living beings, such as earthworms, while cultivating the crops. Therefore, wasting things is just as sinful as killing a living being, so we should value all objects. Furthermore, those who cherish objects will practice frugality, cultivating integrity. When they value things, they will put them to good use and use their resources to help others, enhancing their benevolence. People who cherish objects will focus on leaving blessings and resources to the future, instead of squandering everything in the present, which demonstrates prudence.


Okay, here's my professional translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a tone that reflects the original's emphasis on traditional values and gratitude:

**Title: Appreciating All Things and Living with Gratitude**

And we feel that when a person holds a heart of gratitude, they will cherish every object. For example, when we think about how this piece of clothing was a gift from my aunt, this hat was given by my older sister, and these glasses are from my older brother, we are reminded of their affection. How could we bear to ruin these items? The more you cherish something, the longer it will last. And the more you use it, the more you will feel a connection to it. Your clothes won't get dirty or damaged.

Dr. Masaru Emoto's water experiments in Japan showed that when you treat water with kind thoughts, its crystals form beautifully. If you approach all objects with good intentions, including cherishing everyone’s love for you, their efforts, and the fruits of their labor, you will also respect every profession and everything they produce. These things won’t break easily, and they become more valuable. If you can wear a piece of clothing for twenty years, people will see you and say, "Ah, someone who studies traditional culture really cherishes their possessions." In doing so, you honor the wisdom of the sages.

Secondly, we shouldn’t waste resources. Our ancestors revered Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers. They understood that no resources were to be taken for granted; they should be received with gratitude. Even during a bountiful harvest, they would thank Heaven, Earth, and all things. Therefore, many rituals honored the benevolence of all creation, which is very valuable. People today lack this mindset. They take from nature without restraint, indiscriminately felling forests. The consequences—like landslides and mudflows—are all self-inflicted results of our disrespect for Heaven, Earth, and all things. These are not natural disasters; they are the results of a corrupted human heart.

Further, we should be content with our possessions. Even if someone possesses a vast fortune, they can still only eat three meals a day, or they will become ill. “A mansion of a thousand rooms, yet at night one sleeps in only six feet of space.” No matter how many houses you have, you will only sleep in one bed each night. Has anyone ever said, "I own six houses, and I will sleep in each one for an hour, just to let everyone know how many houses I have!" Guaranteed, they would suffer from a nervous breakdown. Contentment brings happiness; having enough is enough. Why? The meaning of life is to develop our wisdom and elevate our spiritual nature, not to pursue external desires and become slaves to them. To not strive to be a sage, but instead a slave, is truly pitiful.

Therefore, "while living amongst all things, our hearts should be above all things." Xunzi said, "The superior man uses things; the inferior man is used by things." The superior man enjoys material things; the inferior man is vain, his desires never satisfied. Ultimately, his days are spent desperately earning money to pay back debts and loans. What's the point? People in cities today seem to spend their entire lives working without rest, burdened by responsibilities. A truly calm person would not chase after these things, and would not end up killing themselves with work. Instead, what should we do? We should not be stingy, but instead be generous. We should not be greedy for external material pleasures, or for the relationships we encounter with relatives and friends. We should cherish them and be grateful. We should not demand them, thinking they are our due and what we deserve, for that would be a fall from grace. We should cherish the relationships we are fortunate to have; and when the relationship is over, we should not force it, or even harm others. That would be foolish.

One more important concept is that, regarding all objects, we should only have the right to use them, not to own them. Otherwise, our hearts will constantly carry a heavy burden of worry and attachment. It’s also foolish to think of leaving many possessions to the next generation. "A man leaves his son coffers of gold; I teach my son a single classic." Leave wisdom and classics to your children. Today people don't understand, and they leave behind great sums of money instead. Many entrepreneurs leave behind vast fortunes, only to find that their own funerals are delayed, and their children fight over the estate for years. This is the conflict left behind by leaving money to your descendants. Our ancestors created the Chinese character for "money" (錢) as gold (金) next to two blades (刀). Therefore, we should give our wealth away to accumulate virtue for our descendants, not leave it for them to fight over.

Finally, let us all encourage each other with a passage from Mr. Shao Yong. I believe that his state of mind, toward people, events, and objects, always held a heart of gratitude and blessing. He said, "Every morning, a stick of incense," he would rise early, perhaps between three and five o'clock, "Every morning, a stick of incense, to thank Heaven, Earth, and the monarch.” He thanked Heaven and Earth, and he thanked the country, because there was no war. If war broke out, one might be separated from family. People often don't know to be grateful when there is no war. It is only when war comes that we realize how precious the protection of our country is. People tend to cherish something only after losing it. These words remind us that we should always be grateful to our nation. “Every morning, a stick of incense, to thank Heaven, Earth, and the monarch. May the fields in every place be fruitful, may everyone live a long life; may our country have virtuous ministers to secure the nation, may there be no unfilial children to trouble their parents; may there be peace in all directions, and an end to conflict. If I am poor, I still shall be content.” If I am poor, I will still be joyful, because the world is at peace. With this state of mind, we should bless the world, bless the nation, and bless everyone. You can also begin tomorrow, each morning with a stick of incense, our hearts will be large, and with a large heart, comes great blessing.

Alright, that concludes our discussion of the theme "Be a Noble Guide for a Child’s Whole Life.” Thank you all.
