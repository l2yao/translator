Okay, here's my translation of the provided Chinese book excerpt, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow, as a professional translator would aim for:

**Cultivating Good Habits in Children**

**(Using the Content of the *Di Zi Gui* to Foster Positive Daily Routines)**

**Part One: Filial Piety at Home**

**1.  Developing Respectful Attitudes towards Parents from a Young Age**

> *Parents call, respond promptly; parental instructions, act without laziness.*

“*Parents call, respond promptly*” is about cultivating a child’s respectful attitude towards their parents when they are spoken to. A person's behavior reveals their morals and knowledge. Therefore, a child's attitude towards their parents’ speech has a profound influence. When children develop a sense of filial piety and respect, the foundation for their learning is laid. Conversely, if they develop arrogance, their lifelong endeavors will be ruined. The *Great Learning* states, "The ancients who wished to illuminate virtue throughout the world first governed their states. Those who wished to govern their states first regulated their families. Those who wished to regulate their families first cultivated their personal lives. Those who wished to cultivate their personal lives first rectified their hearts. Those who wished to rectify their hearts first made their will sincere. Those who wished to make their will sincere first extended their knowledge. The extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things.” For children to have sincerity of will and a rectified heart, they must cultivate themselves and govern their families. How do they achieve sincerity of will and a rectified heart? They must investigate things and extend their knowledge. Investigating things means removing material desires and bad habits. Impatience and arrogance are bad habits. If children can change their bad habits from a young age, that means they are investigating things and extending their knowledge. Cultivating filial piety and respect in children is how to rectify their hearts. Thus, all great learning begins with small things.

When our parents call us, we, as parents or elders ourselves, should also go over respectfully, setting an example for our children. We should guide children to quickly walk over and respond with, "Mom, Dad, what is it?" We must do it even if we don't feel like it. Once filial piety and respect become ingrained, they will influence the child, naturally creating this atmosphere in the home.

“*Parents call, respond promptly*” cultivates a respectful attitude that should extend beyond parents to teachers, elders, and superiors. The heart is the root, and all actions stem from it. The *Book of Rites* says, “In the code of conduct, there is nothing that is not worthy of respect.” A person with a genuine respectful heart will treat all people and things with respect. Someone who is respectful to their parents, elders, and siblings will do their best in fulfilling their parents' instructions. They will also treat things with respect. Therefore, they won’t waste the food their parents have worked hard to buy!

Should we also practice “*Children call, respond promptly*”? If you immediately run over, you’ve misunderstood. To our children, we are the elders, they are the younger generation. We need to nurture their sense of respect. We should guide them patiently and gently rather than scolding them, and we should learn together. Children will naturally model themselves after the stories of sages. Therefore, we need to understand how to apply our knowledge in different roles.

When a person deeply understands their parents' kindness, their heart naturally becomes gentle and respectful. I remember when my sister got married, there were many wedding rituals, each with its own meaning. I was observing the ceremony, and the final ritual, where my brother-in-law and sister bowed to our parents, left a deep impression on me. When my sister and her husband knelt, my father’s tears instantly welled up. Seeing this, I couldn’t help but cry as well, deeply feeling the heart of a father. A father takes care of his daughter for more than twenty years, constantly worrying and hoping for the best for her, hoping she does well in her studies and finds a good match. Now, seeing her find a good partner, the small consolation brought my father to tears. It was a tear of joy and emotion.

Parents' love for their children is lifelong. The saying goes, “A mother lives to a hundred, and still worries about her eighty-year-old son.”  Even when mothers live to be one hundred years old, an eighty-year-old son is still a child in their eyes. When I truly understood the hardships of being a father, I told myself that I would never be able to repay my parents’ kindness in this lifetime. I could never say a disrespectful or rebellious word to them. Because I had this understanding, seeing my parents naturally made me feel respectful and joyful. By always keeping my parents’ kindness in my heart, and what's "in the middle will show on the outside," respectful words and actions will naturally follow.

“*Parental instructions, act without laziness.*” When we promise to help our parents with something, we shouldn’t be lazy. If we agree, we should do it immediately. Then, when we ask our children to do something, they will listen. If we all adhere to Confucius' teachings and have a shared language with our children, we can have good communication with them. Therefore, we must reflect: now that we’re grown, do we act without laziness when it comes to our parents’ instructions and requests? We are often very unreliable to the people who are most important and kind to us, and even to our closest spouse, why is that? Because if we are unreliable to clients, we don't get paid, whereas we can make excuses to our loved ones by saying that we are busy. Thus, we must realize that we should be even more reliable to our parents, and to all people, this is the correct attitude.

In ancient times, many filial children would anticipate their parents' needs without being asked, and take the initiative to act. You might have heard the story of "Meng Zong Crying over Bamboo." In the Three Kingdoms period, the filial Meng Zong’s mother had been suffering from a poor appetite and a weak spleen for a long time, not able to eat anything. Suddenly, she had a strong desire to eat bamboo shoot soup. Meng Zong knew that if his mother couldn’t eat this, she would be in great pain. But it was winter, and bamboo shoots were nowhere to be found. He was so desperate that he went into the bamboo forest and cried. His tears fell and bamboo shoots sprouted. Why? Sincere determination can penetrate even metal and stone. His filial piety and sincerity moved the bamboo! Let's try dropping our tears, will it move bamboo?

Dr. Masaru Emoto from Japan has researched and found that human intentions can affect minerals and water. When people have good thoughts, water crystals appear beautiful. Even dirty lake water becomes clean. Therefore, there is an interactive state between nature and the human heart. Why were ancient filial children able to move bamboo, many animals, and even the fiercest tigers? It was all because of their filial piety! Our ancestors have performed these great acts for thousands of years. Shouldn't we continue to carry them on? Yes, we should! As long as we can learn their filial piety, we can certainly stage scene after scene of heart-touching stories in our own lives.

Meng Zong's mother was cured after eating the bamboo shoot soup. A truly filial child can bring peace and health to their parents. Thus, “*parental instructions, act without laziness*.”

> *Parents teach, listen respectfully; parents discipline, accept willingly.*

" *Parents teach, listen respectfully*” means that when our parents teach us, we should listen with respect and never talk back. If our father is scolding us and speaks about ten things, and only two of them are true, and we think he has misunderstood the other eight, we should not immediately interrupt him. Because our father is angry, we should simply say "Yes." His anger will gradually subside. Once he's done yelling and has calmed down, he will realize, "Maybe I overdid it with my scolding." He might then offer you some fruit, "Come, let's have some fruit," making a gesture to reconcile. At this point, you should also go over naturally, as if nothing happened. You can't immediately say, "Dad, are you trying to make up with me?" We shouldn't be so rigid, but rather adapt to the situation.

When you don't argue back when your parents are scolding you, when you calmly accept their misunderstandings, your parents will have more respect and admiration for you. This will lead to better communication with your parents. They will slowly feel that their child is the most trustworthy. However, if your father has a heart condition, then you have to adjust accordingly. For example, if he is scolding you fiercely and is about to have a heart attack, are you still going to stand there practicing “*Parents teach, listen respectfully*”? We must be flexible in our learning and constantly think of our parents. Then we will know what to do in any given situation.

“*Parents discipline, accept willingly*.” We should also accept our parents’ punishment, even when they hit us, with gratitude. We should think about why our parents are so angry and what our mistakes really are. Once, Zengzi made a mistake and his father was very angry. He picked up a large wooden stick and hit Zengzi. Zengzi, following “*Parents discipline, accept willingly*,” didn’t move, and allowed his father to hit him. In the end, his father used so much force that he knocked Zengzi unconscious. When Confucius heard of this incident, he told his students that Zengzi was not being filial. Why? When parents are angry, they can't control their emotions. If they lose control and accidentally hit their child's head and kill them, who will be the most heartbroken? The parents. Therefore, Confucius said: “When the stick is small, you should accept it; when the stick is large, you should run away.” If you see that the stick your father is holding could kill you, you must run away! We cannot put our parents in a position of injustice. We should learn to apply the wisdom of sages flexibly.

I once asked my students, "After your parents scold you, what's your reaction?" One student replied, "I feel unlucky. Next time I need to be more careful not to get caught." I told the students that when their parents scold them, their bodies are harmed. It takes three days for the body to recover after a temper tantrum. Yelling at others is so bad for the body, yet parents are willing to hurt themselves in order to teach you a lesson and prevent you from doing things that are not good for you in the future. Therefore, you should appreciate this intention of your parents. They teach you to improve your morals and learning; you must be worthy of your parents' care and love.

The way parents love us might be gentle sometimes, and harsh at other times, but the love behind it is always the same, and we must understand that. We must be worthy of our parents’ teachings and should not let them harm their bodies for no reason. Therefore, we must remember to not make the same mistakes. We must understand that being scolded can lead to progress, and we should learn from Yan Hui's virtue of "not repeating the same mistake." We must never do anything that makes our parents angry or sad again. When a child develops this mindset, they will not repeat their mistakes.

Besides listening respectfully to our parents’ teachings, we must also listen respectfully to our teachers’ teachings. In order to have good morals and learning, besides having good teachers, the most important factor is our own learning attitude. We must have a devout and respectful heart towards our teachers, and not be outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant. A person’s depth of knowledge can be judged from their respectful heart. One part of sincerity brings one part of benefit; ten parts sincerity brings ten parts benefit. Because we may not fully understand every single thing our teacher tells us. Learning can be compared to a twenty-story building, and our teacher might be on the fifteenth floor while we are only on the second or third floor. Our teacher is able to see things from the fifteenth floor that we on the second or third floor are not able to see. Teachers' directions are always aimed at long-term goals. If we don’t follow their teachings, we will not benefit from them.

Why is it so hard for modern people to achieve great learning? It is because we often make a serious mistake: to look at others with our small-mindedness. Even the ideas in the *Analects* are interpreted according to one's own understanding, bringing Confucius down to our level. Sometimes we even feel that we are smarter than Confucius. How can we achieve anything this way? Therefore, at the beginning of learning with a teacher, you must never criticize; instead, you must follow the teacher’s directions honestly. Only then will you experience the truth of the saying: one part sincerity brings one part benefit. When your realm has improved, you will then gradually understand that your teacher’s words were indeed true. Thus, "teacher's teachings" must also be “*listen respectfully.*”

We must also listen respectfully to our superiors’ teachings. A person’s learning or career can only achieve success with a heart of respect and humility. Thus, people must know how to yield in order to succeed. We must teach children to be respectful and humble, and to learn from all situations. In a new environment, don't complain; instead, observe, listen, and learn more. Do as your superiors teach you. Only after your knowledge has grown and you have a deeper understanding of the company, should you offer your superiors some advice.

**2. Caring for Parents' Daily Life and Greeting Elders Morning and Evening**

> *Warm in winter, cool in summer; check in the morning, settle in the evening.*

During the Eastern Han Dynasty, there was a child named Huang Xiang. His father was in poor health, and his mother had passed away. So, he tried his best to take care of his father. At the age of nine, he already knew to warm his father's bed before he went to sleep in the winter, so it would be warm when his father went to bed. In the summer, he would use a fan to cool the bed before inviting his father to sleep. A nine-year-old already knew to practice filial piety. When the emperor heard of this, he wrote eight words: "Huang Xiang of Jiangxia, unequaled in the world" to acknowledge him with high praise. The emperor was wise in doing this. He knew that by praising good deeds, he could encourage his people to follow Huang Xiang's example. Later, Huang Xiang became a high official, making significant contributions to the people.

Checking in the morning and settling in the evening is about making our parents happy and worry-free. Many people say that they are simply not good at sweet-talking. In reality, the obstacle lies within our own hearts, not on the outside. If our words can make our parents happy, and you have this benefit in your heart, this is the way of filial piety. Why would you say that you simply can’t speak sweetly because of your habit? People can do anything if they try. Don’t push it aside by saying that you are just this way, and that your personality is naturally this way. Your personality can change anytime, as long as you truly have filial piety and the will to help others. Then your whole way of speaking and behavior will change.

After listening to a class, a teacher called our center and said, "There are flaws in the *Di Zi Gui*." If you tell him that he is wrong, he will immediately start arguing with you. I asked him politely, "Which words do you think are flawed?" The teacher said, "Checking in the morning and settling in the evening is flawed." I asked him why. He said that it was too bothersome to greet his parents twice a day! Then, I told the teacher, "How many times a day do parents think about their children? Constantly." The teacher was speechless. Another female teacher told me that during the changes of season, the temperature would fluctuate greatly. Children would often kick off their blankets in the middle of the night. Therefore, during these transitional seasons, they would use thinner blankets. Why? To make sure they could wake up in the middle of the night to cover their children with blankets. Parents constantly think about their children, even when they are sleeping, let alone during the day. If every morning, children greet their parents with, "Good morning, Mom and Dad. Did you sleep well last night?" When we bow, as the saying goes, "A person is full of energy when there is a joyful event." What can bring more joy than filial piety from your children? So, their parents will have a good mood throughout the entire day. And when parents see you full of energy, it means that you slept well, and they feel at peace. When children come back from school in the afternoon, they should greet their parents. When parents see that their children are in good spirits, it means that they didn’t have any conflicts at school with teachers or classmates, so parents can also feel at peace. These two daily greetings can ease a lot of parents’ worries. After I explained this, the teacher became more receptive, and he said, "Teacher Cai, your understanding of Chinese culture is very good. Who did you learn from?" We practice not accepting praise readily, so I told him humbly that I learned from Teacher Yang Shufen. Suddenly, this teacher came back with a question. "Teacher Cai, you are not doing this yourself." Because I travel all over the world to promote traditional Chinese culture, I cannot “check in the morning and settle in the evening” with my parents. The one thing teachers fear most is when students say, “Teacher, you're not doing it.” I broke out into a cold sweat. At this point I told the teacher, "If I called home in the morning and again in the evening, my mother would scold me. She would say, 'Don't you know that long-distance calls are very expensive? Don't call so often. Just call once every Saturday night.'" So, we must follow our parents' wishes, and have a tacit agreement with them. Then, when the phone rings every Saturday, parents know it is their child calling. At this point, we report to our parents on the things we did during the week, and we also care about what is going on at home.

The essence of “*check in the morning, settle in the evening*” is to not let our parents worry, and that is the most important thing. If our morals are not good, then even if we call them ten times a day, our parents will still worry. Therefore, we must improve our morals and put our parents at ease. Only then can we truly fulfill the essence of this phrase.

One child, after learning about "checking in the morning and settling in the evening," went home the next day and very seriously waited in front of his parents’ door. As soon as he saw them, he bowed and said, “Good morning, Mom and Dad, did you sleep well last night?” His parents were surprised by his actions, and immediately called the kindergarten, “What happened yesterday? Why is our child suddenly greeting us?” The teachers said they had learned about “checking in the morning and settling in the evening” yesterday. Are children hard to teach? They are not hard to teach. It’s just that we haven't taught them.

King Wen of Zhou would greet his father three times a day: in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. He would check his father’s complexion, and see how he ate. If his father ate well, he would be very happy; if his father ate very little, he would worry. Because of his example, his son, King Wu, and Duke Zhou were also very filial.

Parents are happy when their children come home to visit them. But some young people who go home on the weekend to see their parents, how do they visit? They bring one or two kids, and as soon as they enter the door, the couple sits on the couch to read the newspaper and watch TV. The children run around. Grandparents are busy buying and cooking food, and when they are done, they bring out the food and call, “Dinner is ready!” Then they eat together, and after dinner, they don't help their parents clear the table or wash the dishes. They just say, “Mom, we're leaving,” and leave with their children. Grandparents breathe a sigh of relief, thinking that they were more tired than if they had not come back at all, that it would have been more peaceful. So, we must understand that, first, going home to see our parents is an act of filial piety. Second, we must be considerate of our parents. We should call our parents in advance and say that we have already bought groceries. When we go home, we should be the ones who cook, to ease the burden on our parents. Only then do we truly fulfill our filial duty.

**3. When Leaving Home, Notify Family, When Returning Home, Greet Family**

> *When leaving, inform; when returning, greet; living has a routine; work has constancy.*

When we leave home, we should tell our parents where we are going, so that they can be at peace. If you are leaving home for school, it is best that your parents personally visit the school and where you will be staying. When parents see that the school and living environment are good, they will feel at ease. As their children, we should be considerate of their hearts. After leaving home, we should also let our parents know our contact numbers and address, so that they can contact us in case of an emergency. When we return home, we must greet our parents first so that they know we have returned safely and can be at ease.

These habits are very important for children. Don't underestimate the details. When children understand "checking in the morning and settling in the evening," every greeting to their parents is deepening the bond between them. Every "when leaving, inform, when returning, greet" is to help them understand that their actions should never cause their parents to worry.

There was a student who, after school, went straight to the study room to play video games without saying hello to his family. After more than an hour, his mother thought he had not returned home yet, so she called the school to ask if he had stayed late with the teacher. When I answered, it had already been more than an hour since school had ended. How could he not be home yet? His mother was very worried and said she would call the police. I said, "Don't do that, check your home carefully." She later found him hiding in his study room playing video games. This caused his parents a great deal of worry. Therefore, we must cultivate good habits.

Besides telling our parents when we leave and greeting them when we return, we must also do the same with our family, such as our spouse. We should tell the people who care about us when we leave and greet them when we return, so they don’t worry! That is how we should be treating each other in life. Are there this kind of honesty and sincerity between spouses nowadays? If spouses are not honest with each other, and have to hide things from one another, then their marriage will become very difficult over the decades. The most important principle of keeping a good household is to have no secrets, to interact with sincerity, and to be tolerant with each other. That is how to live a relaxed and free life.

This translation aims to be both accurate and engaging for an English-speaking audience, maintaining the core message and intentions of the original text.


Okay, here is my translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for a professional and accurate rendering that maintains the tone and nuance of the original:

**Book Title: Cultivating Harmony and Success Through Respect and Responsibility**

**Chapter 1**

When you are certain you won't be home for dinner, it is essential to call your wife in advance. Don't wait until dinnertime to call, as she will have already prepared a meal for you. We should not take for granted the care and effort others extend to us; we should cherish and be considerate of them. When family members can be understanding of each other, the family will prosper.

Similarly, at work, we should always inform others of our comings and goings. For example, if you need to leave to take care of something, and you don't tell anyone, and then someone urgently needs to reach you, they won’t know where to find you. This will cause extreme anxiety. Your superiors will also feel resentful and develop a lack of trust in your reliability. Therefore, whenever we need to leave our posts, we must inform our colleagues or superiors before we go. Otherwise, if people need you and can't find you, the atmosphere will become very unpleasant.

"Inform others of your comings and goings" is crucial, first and foremost, to alleviate our parents' worries. By extension, it reduces the anxiety of our family and those around us; they shouldn't have to worry because they don’t know where we are.  We must be mindful and diligently consider whether our words and actions are causing burdens to others.

"Maintain a routine at home and constancy in your pursuits." "Routine at home" can be viewed from several perspectives. For students, it's their studies; for those who've entered society, it's their career; and for those who are married, it's their family life. There can be no perfection without rules. Thus, life should be well-regulated so that our studies, career, and family life can be managed effectively. Do today’s students and children have this "routine at home"? Often, when Friday comes, they become indulgent. Some watch TV until midnight, while others go out dancing all night. What do they do on Saturday and Sunday? They sleep. If they can recover from it, that’s okay; but if they don't, their bodies will be gradually worn down. When parents witness such behavior, they should correct it promptly. From a young age, they should not allow children to watch television indiscriminately. Because once a precedent is set, one follows two, and three makes it a custom.

Once a person develops a bad habit, it’s very difficult to break. This is the meaning of “being preoccupied with pleasure distracts from one's aspirations.” Moreover, today's children often lack ambition. If they are preoccupied with pleasure, they will truly become "bewildered by indulgence" and completely absorbed in entertainment, unable to extract themselves. This is why we see in the newspapers many stories about students who stay online until the middle of the night and the problems that ensue. In this era, we as elders must be particularly cautious because we are often harmed by the benefits of technology before we have time to benefit from them. Students are exposed to the internet so early, and their spirit, morality, and knowledge are not being developed. Because children lack stability and their internet use is not monitored, they are likely to meet bad influences online. Lacking judgment or reason because they have not studied the classics, they might be led astray by sweet words from online acquaintances. Life can then be irrevocably ruined. When children truly make mistakes that are difficult to rectify, it can be a lifetime of regret for their parents. Therefore, we must be vigilant.

Our studies and careers should reassure our parents, and our family life should be harmonious between spouses. If parents are at ease and the next generation is well-educated, they’ll also be reassured. Mencius said, "There are three forms of unfilial conduct, and the greatest is to have no descendants." What does it mean to "have no descendants"? Does simply having a son mean one has descendants? This is a shallow interpretation. If you raise a spendthrift son, grandparents might think it would have been better not to have him at all; they might even be infuriated to death by him. The deeper meaning of "to have no descendants" is the failure to educate one's offspring, causing them to disgrace their parents and ancestors. That is true “having no descendants”.

There was a college student from Shandong who often played video games, usually violent ones, until late at night. Eventually, his nerves became abnormal, and he constantly felt that people were trying to kill him. He told his teacher, who realized that something was wrong and immediately notified his parents. His parents came to take him home, but before they could, this student had already gone out on the street wielding a knife, injuring many people, some fatally.  This is how indulging in play can lead to losing one’s purpose in life. One mistake can ruin a life.

Therefore, we must nurture our wisdom and diligently manage our studies, career, and family life so that we can reassure our parents. Choose an industry that suits you, and then develop it to the best of your ability. You must never be unrealistic or wish for the impossible. In this age, many people often seek to get rich quickly, but there is no such thing as a free lunch. When such thoughts of getting rich quickly arise, we often fall into the trap of “Haste makes waste”, and we become very restless when changing jobs. When a person's mind is restless, will they make the right decisions? It is difficult. When someone changes jobs, they are likely to make their parents worry again.

Every time one changes jobs, it actually impacts one's social credit. Moreover, wealth in life cannot be obtained through competition. As the saying goes, "If it's meant to be, it will be; if not, don't force it." If you want to harvest, the most important thing is to first sow good deeds. The true cause of wealth is generosity and giving back to society. Those who give of their wealth naturally receive wealth. Take Li Ka-Shing, Hong Kong’s richest man, for example. He is from Shantou, and he donates a large sum of money every year and builds many public facilities to give back to his hometown. Therefore, we must manage our work steadily and diligently; we must not be unrealistic or too restless. When one acts rashly, it affects our family and friends. The more stable our actions, the more reassured they will be.

**Chapter 2**

**Even Small Matters Should Be Handled with Discernment**

**Arbitrary Actions, No Matter How Minor, Detract from One's Sense of Duty and are an Act of Unfilial Behavior.**

*"Even in small matters, avoid acting arbitrarily. If one acts arbitrarily, one fails to fulfil the duty of a son (or child)."*

In fact, great good is built upon small acts of good, and great evil arises from accumulating small acts of evil.  Therefore, Liu Bei gave his children a significant piece of advice: “Do not refrain from doing good just because it is small, and do not commit evil just because it is small.” You cannot be complacent about a child's words and actions. If you're too casual, there is a chance they will make serious mistakes later. Of course, to teach children not to “act arbitrarily," parents must first refrain from doing so themselves, setting a good example for their children. For instance, if you put your feet on the table while watching television, it sends a message to your children that you are very casual.

In Shenzhen, we had a teacher who was driving with a five-year-old child when they had to stop at a red light. The child, seeing the teacher stop, said, "Teacher, you don't need to stop; just drive straight through and turn later." Where did he learn this? His mother was a police officer. This illustrates, "Even in small matters, avoid acting arbitrarily." The teacher was very perceptive and immediately realized that he needed to communicate with the parents. When children have not yet developed their sense of right and wrong, if we set a bad example, the consequences could be very dire. The teacher was very tactful when he called the child's parent, saying, “Your son taught me how to drive today.” His mother immediately chuckled; she knew what he meant. So, as elders, we cannot knowingly commit mistakes. We must be perceptive to many minute details and set a good example for our children. When you have such an attitude, you will find that your virtue and learning are growing daily.

In regard to rules, we must also tell children, “Even in small matters, avoid acting arbitrarily.” They cannot litter casually. Littering might seem like a small matter, but when it becomes a habit, it will not only disgrace the family, it could disgrace the country. I have heard that when people get lost while hiking, they follow trails with litter. This might seem convenient, but on a deeper level, it is a tragedy of human behavior. It reflects not only a lack of a sense of shame but also a failure to care for nature. The Chinese have been taught by sages for thousands of years that "Heaven is the father, and Earth is the mother." We should cherish this land that has nourished us. Therefore, even in matters as small as littering, we must not act arbitrarily.

The internet reported on three news stories. The first occurred at Pearl Harbor in the United States. Even though it is an English-speaking place, a sign in Chinese on their trash cans read: "Please throw trash here." Who was it meant for? The second was in the Royal Palace in Thailand, another international tourist destination. In their toilets, they posted signs in Chinese that read: "Please flush after use." Who were they meant for? They were meant for the Chinese. In Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, there was also a sign in Chinese: "Please do not speak loudly." These three instances are all small matters, but they form a major issue: Chinese people have lost their reputation on the world stage because of these actions. When we talk about this with children, they might say, "Teacher, let’s erase them.” I ask, "How do we erase them? When you do something wrong, and people want to talk about it, do you shut them up? You can shut one person up, but can you shut everybody up?" Impossible! We must feel ashamed, and we must not disgrace our country. We must start with ourselves, not litter casually, and maintain public hygiene and peace.

Let's think again: I believe most Chinese people haven’t been to the Royal Palace of Thailand or Paris. Those who have are most likely students studying abroad, wealthy, or hold good social standing. Yet, their behavior shows that they have not even learned basic social etiquette. This reveals that education does not equal good manners, nor does it guarantee that one knows how to conduct oneself. Education is truly about developing the correct attitude for living and interacting with others. If schools cannot teach this, then the foundation of family education must be solidified first. Teachers in schools are very dedicated, but it is not easy for one teacher to face dozens of children. Only if parents actively cooperate with teachers can children develop good behavior.

Therefore, we must remember, regarding safety and rules, “Even in small matters, avoid acting arbitrarily.” If you act arbitrarily, “you fail to fulfill the duty of a son (or child)". As the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we would be failing our responsibilities.

**Chapter 3**

**Even the Smallest Things Should Not Be Secretly Kept**

*"Even the smallest things should not be secretly kept. If you secretly keep something, you break the heart of your loved ones."*

When children have not yet developed the ability to distinguish right from wrong, they might take something simply because they find it interesting. So, it’s crucial for parents to be attentive to raising their children, because when children do something wrong, it is immediately shown in their faces – they appear uneasy. A mother once noticed that her child's complexion looked different when he came home that day, so she checked his schoolbag and found several apples inside. She immediately asked her child, "Where did these apples come from?" The child, knowing that he had done wrong, was very nervous and confessed that he had taken them from a fruit store with some classmates. He didn't necessarily want to eat them; he just got caught up in the excitement with his friends.

Without saying a word, the mother immediately took her child to the fruit store, bowed deeply to the owner, and said, "My child took a few apples." The owner didn't think it was a big deal. But, the mother paid him for the apples and asked her child to apologize to the owner. When a child makes a mistake for the first time, if you immediately correct him, he will remember it for life and won’t do it again. When he sees his mother bow in apology, he will feel very ashamed. Therefore, the mother's example can awaken a child's feelings of shame and remorse. Children will inevitably make mistakes, but as long as we guide them promptly, those are valuable opportunities for education.

Mothers of old always remembered to teach their children that “not even a single melon or fruit should be grabbed, and not even a thread of silk should be taken without permission”. They never allowed their children to develop the habit of taking small advantages. The saying goes, “Steal a needle when young, steal gold when old.” Teaching children that “even the smallest things should not be secretly kept” and that they should not take other people's things has a profound and lasting effect. Because if a child is greedy, they will eventually steal and snatch whatever they want by any means necessary. So, teaching a child not to be greedy is cultivating in them a heart of integrity. The ancients spoke of “recommending the filial and honest”, and why were “filial piety” and “honesty” used to evaluate whether a person could serve the nation? Let’s look at this. "Filial piety is the root of virtue,” and the root of being a human lies in filial piety. “Honesty” is the root of one's actions. Only with a heart of integrity will one not pursue personal gain and will one be impartial and do things well. Therefore, the foundation of being a person and doing things lies in filial piety and integrity. How do we see if a country is governed well? We look to the integrity of its officials. Therefore, integrity is the foundation of politics. If those in power lack integrity, the lives of the people will be very difficult.

Many of the problems in modern society stem from education. The teachings of Chinese sages have been neglected for some time. Therefore, we must start with ourselves, with every parent and every teacher, to teach children not to be greedy and to cultivate a heart of integrity. Only in this way will society become better in decades to come.  So, “do not secretly keep” means first that we should not be greedy, and second that we should not be selfish. We should learn to give and nurture a generous attitude in children. If a child keeps everything he gets for himself, his heart will become increasingly narrow. I remember a group of students who lived together and attended classes together. One of their mothers brought several bottles of milk to her son and told him, “This is all for you.” She was afraid the other students would see. Consequently, her son had to drink the milk secretly. Although he was getting the nutrition, it wasn’t a pleasant experience, and it was bound to have a negative impact on his personality.

Their teacher observed this and spoke to this child that night: "You have so many bottles of milk.  Instead of enjoying it by yourself, why not share with everyone? It is good to share good things with good friends. Would you be willing to share them with everyone?" The child replied simply, "Okay!" All of the students were very happy, because he was going to share his milk with them. And so, a subtle thing happened; when you are willing to give, it brings joy to others and allows you to consider their needs. Thus, when the milk was about to be poured out too much, the children would say, "That's enough; let's save some for the others."

Giving is more rewarding than receiving, because when the other students were drinking the milk, they all said thank you to the child, which made him very happy. He wrote in his diary that evening that he was especially happy to share his milk with everyone. It tasted especially good. When his mother read his diary and saw how generous he was, she suddenly felt she might have made a mistake. "When wealth is shared, people come together." A person must be generous to win people over, and then life and career will flourish. Our generosity and non-greed will serve as good examples for our children.

Yang Zhen of the Han Dynasty was a very honest official, and he often recommended talented people to serve the nation. While serving as the Governor of Donglai, he recommended a scholar named Wang Mi to be the magistrate of Changyi. This man was very grateful to Yang Zhen, and one night, he brought him some gold. When Yang Zhen saw it, he said to Wang Mi, “I understand you so well, and I recommended you for this position. Why do you misunderstand me so much? Why would you bring me gold?” Wang Mi replied, “It’s okay, this is just a small token of my appreciation. Nobody will ever find out about this.” Yang Zhen said, "How can no one know? Heaven knows, Earth knows, you know, and I know." Wang Mi left feeling ashamed. So, where does a person’s character show? It is where others cannot see that a person’s true character is revealed.

Yang Zhen’s integrity set a good example for his descendants, so his son Bing, his grandson Ci, and his great-grandson Biao all became high-ranking officials in the government. Yang Zhen’s refusal to be greedy earned him great merit and blessings. As the saying goes, “A family that accumulates goodness will surely have lasting blessings."  In addition to the reward of good fortune, more importantly, his character became an example for future generations. Therefore, we, too, must be good examples for our children.

At the same time, we should teach our children to cherish public property and not to use it for personal gain. This is very important. I have met many successful people, and they all mention that their parents, who worked in public office, would never use company cars for personal matters. They even wouldn't make personal calls on company phones. They were very honest and that left a profound impression on their children.

I once asked a group of children, "Who bought your school chairs? Who bought the school supplies?" They simply answered, "The principal bought them." I then asked, "Where did the principal get the money?" They said, "The government gave it to them."  "Where did the government get the money?" "From taxpayers," they replied. "How many taxpayers are there?" Children from mainland China said, "1.3 billion." "Have you paid taxes?" I asked. "No," they said. "Well, there are at least hundreds of millions of people who are taxpayers. Therefore, the school property—the chairs, or any other object— how many owners does it have? Hundreds of millions of owners. Stealing something is incurring debts to hundreds of millions of people, and you will never be able to repay that debt, even if you work like a slave." So, we need to guide our children and let them know that everything has an owner. You cannot just take it for your personal enjoyment.

**Chapter 4**

**Strive To Make Your Parents Happy**

*“What your parents like, try your best to provide. What your parents dislike, be careful to avoid.”*

"What your parents like, try your best to provide" means to always think of ways to do things that please your parents; this is respect for your parents. “What your parents dislike, be careful to avoid” means to quickly correct our bad habits that displease our parents. Although we say this is to respect our parents, it is in fact respect for ourselves. "Injuring your body brings sorrow to your parents," so we should respect our bodies. “Disgracing your moral character brings shame to your parents,” so our moral conduct should not bring shame to our parents.  Respect for parents must translate into practical actions; you must absolutely not do things that would disgrace them.

“What your parents like, try your best to provide” means we should do our best to fulfill their expectations for us. To do what they expect of us, we must have a basic element: self-improvement and development of wisdom. Only with wisdom can we fulfill our parents' expectations. Without wisdom and proper understanding, how can we take good care of our bodies? It’s very difficult. Without wisdom, it is difficult to educate our children well, and it is also difficult for our careers to develop sustainably.

“What your parents like, try your best to provide." When our parents ask us to study hard, we must do it. “What your parents like," we must also clearly know what kind of care our parents need in their hearts. I once asked my students, "Do you know what your parents like to eat?" The children all took a long time to think about it. I then asked them, “Does your mother know what you like to eat?" They all replied without hesitation that their mother knew what they liked to eat. I then went on to say to them, "You see, your mother knows what you like to eat, but you don't know what your mother likes to eat. We are really unfair and uncaring towards our parents." The children all said that they would take more care of their parents in the future.

During the Han Dynasty, there was a scholar named Cai Shun. His mother loved to eat mulberries. One day, he went out to pick mulberries with two baskets. He put the black and purple ones on one side and the red ones on the other. On his way home carrying the baskets, he encountered bandits. The bandits grabbed him and were puzzled when they saw his two baskets of mulberries. They asked, "Why do you pick mulberries separately?” He replied, “The black and purple mulberries are sweeter; they are for my mother to eat. The red ones are not ripe, so I'm going to eat them myself.” Because Cai Shun had done “what your parents like, try your best to provide," the bandit was moved by this.  He let him go and even wanted to give him rice and other things to take back to his mother. However, Cai Shun understood the principle that a gentleman should only take what is rightfully his, so he declined the bandit’s offer.  The bandit let him go because Cai Shun’s filial piety awakened his own sense of filial piety. Therefore, we must believe that “at the beginning of human life, people are inherently good.” As long as one has good character, even the most wicked people can be influenced. When we face evil people, should we attack or scold them? No.  The most important thing is to do our best so that we can affect them and affect society.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow in English while retaining the original message and tone.

**Title: The Importance of Labor and Filial Piety in Raising Children**

How many lessons are interwoven into the stories we tell our children? The first is “*qīn suǒ hǎo, lì wéi jù*” (親所好，力為具), meaning, “do your best to provide what your loved ones cherish.” The second is “*rén zhī chū, xìng běn shàn*” (人之初，性本善), “at birth, people are inherently good,” and we should use virtue to influence and reform them. The third is “*jiàn dé sī yì*” (見得思義), which means, “a gentleman loves wealth, but acquires it through proper means.” When we tell stories to students, if we don’t explain these underlying principles, the impression left will simply be, “I’ve heard that story before.” But if we only lecture on principles without telling stories, most people will quickly become bored and unable to absorb the lessons. Therefore, we must integrate principles and stories together. In that way, the listener will have a much better grasp of the meaning.

Many ancient family instructions placed great emphasis on cultivating a diligent attitude in children. The first line of *Zhu Zi's Family Precepts* states: “Rise at dawn to sweep the courtyard clean, ensuring both inside and outside are tidy; retire at dusk to lock the doors, and personally check them.” Therefore, in the past, children did many of the household chores. This prevented them from becoming lazy and averse to labor. When they understood how to share the burden of housework, they were able to appreciate the hardship of work and become grateful. It’s difficult for modern children to develop a sense of gratitude because everything is done for them; they are clothed, fed, and completely unaware of the hardships of life.

There was a fourth-grade girl who, after school one day, said she wanted to personally fry a plate of cucumbers for her mother. Her mother agreed. She went to the kitchen, and because she wasn't tall enough, she moved a chair over and stood on it. She poured oil into the pan, and it immediately splattered. Afraid of getting burned, she quickly put on a large glove. Then, when she added the cucumbers, the oil splattered even more. In a panic, she ran and grabbed her father's safety helmet, fully arming herself before finally managing to fry the dish, covered in sweat. Did she grow from that experience? Will she be critical of her mother’s cooking from then on? I believe not! Having made the effort, she will understand how hard it is for her mother to work and cook so many dishes. Therefore, learning through labor leads to gratitude.

Learning through labor leads to gratitude, and this helps children develop a habit of diligence. Diligence is beneficial for their health, because while children work, their brains are always active. That is why students who frequently help with housework are particularly sharp-minded. Some students may have excellent grades, but they do nothing at home. If you ask them to do things, you might get so angry because they have no experience! I once had a student who, whenever he needed something, would have his mother call me. I told him, “You can just talk to me directly, why do you have your mother call?” He would always lower his head and not say anything, and the next time his mother would call again. Because children don't often take responsibility, they become timid when faced with challenges. This is actually harming them.

Labor increases one's willpower. Uncle Lu once said that when he was young, his mother saw that their neighbor's water tank was empty. His mother asked him to fill the neighbor’s tank. That generation was very respectful to their parents, so when “parents commanded, they didn’t slack off.” He went to the stream to carry water back. At the time it was a bit past 4pm, and it took two hours to carry water from the stream and back, and two trips were needed to fill the tank. So, he wouldn’t return until 8 or 9pm, with the meal already cold. Would parents today have the heart to do that? If you can’t bear to do that, you won't be able to cultivate someone as talented as Uncle Lu. His mother understood the importance of helping others, and also used that to temper his willpower.

Whenever Uncle Lu faces great work pressure, an image always comes to mind: the time he spent carrying water. He would think, “I can’t hold on much longer. But if I give up here, it’s no use either. I still have to keep moving forward step by step.” So, when facing challenges, his first thought is, “Move forward, don’t retreat!” Therefore, labor constantly improves a person’s willpower. Modern children lack these experiences, so we need to quickly get them doing chores and contributing, in order to cultivate good character and attitude.

To avoid developing bad habits, the most important thing is to cultivate a habit of doing household chores from a young age. Learning through labor leads to gratitude, and being grateful helps develop diligence. Abilities are also built up bit by bit. Therefore, the ability to do things isn’t something learned in adulthood; it should be developed from a young age. This also strengthens children’s will and cultivates their communication skills.

When I used to teach science, after every class there were a lot of materials to clean up. There were always a few students who would stay behind to help, without being asked. These students were very pleasing and those are the kind of students we would especially care for. So, diligent children easily gain the support, concern, and love of elders. With peers, diligence also directly affects popularity. For example, at university, if a student lives in a dorm with several others, and he immediately sees others cleaning the living room and joins in, showing that he knows how to help and understand the hardship of others, his actions will win the other students’ good impression, and he will easily integrate into the group.

Many college students are expelled from school. Why? Because they have a poor ability to take care of themselves. Teachers and classmates don't want to live with them. In Shenzhen, a college student was expelled from school, and the newspaper reported on it, even including a cartoon: a person wearing a graduation cap with his mother feeding him, and the caption, “A highly skilled scholar, but inept in daily life.” Friends, don’t think it’s an exaggeration. This student really was being fed by his mother in university, because he and his mother were in a deadlock, and if his mother didn’t feed him, he wouldn’t eat. He was so old and still causing his parents such worry!

Why do children have this kind of attitude? It's because they've been spoiled by their parents from a young age. Without rules, there is no standard. Educating children requires cultivating good habits. You absolutely cannot indulge children. If you allow them to develop bad habits, it will be very hard to change them when they grow up. For instance, if a child goes to see a teacher at school, he doesn't look at the time, and goes to ring the doorbell while the teacher is napping. When he goes inside to borrow the teacher's computer, he drops food all over the floor without cleaning it up. Teachers and classmates are very afraid of him. If you want your children to have a smooth life, you have to help them develop good habits. Otherwise, their bad habits will become a big obstacle to their careers. We should strive to cultivate what is good and strive to correct what is bad, starting with ourselves, setting a good example for our children.

“*Qīn suǒ hǎo*” (親所好) doesn't just refer to parents; it refers to all the wishes of our loved ones. We should do our best to achieve and fulfill those wishes. For example, our wives and children must want us to spend more time with them. There’s a great saying, "All success cannot compensate for failure at home." Many people say, "I'm so busy with work, where do I find time to spend with my children?" or "In the workplace, it’s not up to me.” Is there truth in that? That’s an excuse. As long as you have the will, you will find ways to do things well. Of course, many situations occur in life, so you must learn to refuse. Otherwise, your time will be spent on social engagements and things that are not important to your family or your life.

Is it easy to learn how to refuse? No, it’s not. But we can use two secret weapons to refuse others. These two secret weapons will usually deter our friends from making things difficult for us. The first weapon is our parents. For example, if your friends want you to go out to the bars, which would likely involve staying up until 1 or 2 am, just to engage in meaningless talk, and you don’t want to go, you can call on your parents. You can say, “I promised my mother I would go back to visit her tonight. I promised her a week or two ago, so I have to go back.” When your friends hear you are going back to visit your parents, they won’t pressure you. Maybe when they hear that, they'll even suddenly think, “I haven’t visited my parents in a while.” Your refusal might even awaken their filial piety. This is the first secret weapon.

The second secret weapon is your wife and children. When you don’t want to attend a pointless social engagement, you can tell your friends, “Tonight, I have to tell my son two moral stories. I already promised him, and we’re studying the *Di Zi Gui* together. We’re also using the *Di Zi Gui* as our family rules. The *Di Zi Gui* says, 'When you speak, your words must be truthful,' and my son is still young, so I cannot break my promise. I have to go back.” When you bring out these two trump cards, your friends won't force you. If they still try to drag you along after you’ve used these two trump cards, what should you do? If that’s the kind of friend they are, we need to make some choices and keep them at a distance.

“*Qīn suǒ hǎo, lì wéi jù*” (親所好，力為具) also requires us to visit our parents often, which is what they desire the most. We have to understand that going home to visit parents is both fulfilling our filial duties and also caring for our parents. Before going home, we should call them and say, “We have already bought groceries, please don't worry.” When we get home, the husband and wife should actively take over the cooking to reduce our parents' burden. This is when our filial piety is truly fulfilled.

**6. Protect Your Personal Safety and Refrain from Illegal Activities**

*Shēn yǒu shāng, yí qīn yōu; dé yǒu shāng, yí qīn xiū.* (身有傷，貽親憂；德有傷，貽親羞) “Harm to the body causes parents worry, harm to virtue causes parents shame."

What do our parents hope and expect most from us? That we are healthy. *The Analects* states, "*Fùmǔ wéi qí jí zhī yōu.*" (父母唯其疾之憂) which means “Parents only worry about their children’s illness.” This “illness” refers not only to physical health but, by extension, to bad habits. What kind of bad habits can bring disaster? These are things we should “*qīn suǒ è, jǐn wéi qù.*” (親所惡，謹為去) “Carefully avoid what our loved ones dislike."

We should remind our children often about many things, especially regarding safety. They should always be reminded about actions that could put their lives in danger. For example, crossing the road not only ensures safety but also teaches a disciplined attitude. We should always follow safety rules. During summer and winter vacations, accidents often happen. Children playing with fireworks can start fires, and children going swimming without telling anyone. As our ancestors said, “Extreme joy leads to sorrow.” We should teach children about safety from a young age. If we constantly remind them, they will be more sensitive to safety. For example, when they are holding a hot beverage, we should tell them to be careful, and this will help reduce accidents.

Besides reminding children to be careful about their own safety, we also have to remind them that they should never do anything that could put others in danger. When they have this attitude, they will always watch their words and actions to see if they could cause harm to others. I remember once reading a news report about a child who, for fun, suddenly pulled away a chair just before his classmate was about to sit down. As a result, his classmate fell and injured his spine severely, becoming paralyzed for life. We must use these examples to teach students that even a small action can cause great suffering to others. This boy will have to endure decades in bed. Just try lying in bed for three days and you’ll be uncomfortable all over. Not only is he suffering, but his parents are suffering more than him. Seeing their child become that way after raising him for over a decade is a constant torment. This is a lifelong hurt to their parents. When something bad happens to someone, not just their parents will worry about them, but all their family and friends will also be very sad. One small action can cause so much suffering to so many people, and that is something we must absolutely never do.

Poor health and injuries will cause parents great worry. Sickness can come from the mouth, so we need to be mindful of what we eat. We need to eat healthily and not worry our parents. Besides what we eat, we should also care for our health in other aspects of life. When the weather changes drastically in the spring and autumn, we need to remember to add layers of clothing. When I was teaching, there were many students who were wearing short sleeves even when a cold front had arrived, thinking they weren’t afraid of the cold. I would tell them, “Put on some more clothes. If you get sick, who will take care of you?” They would think, “My parents.” I’d say, “That’s right! If you were taking care of yourself when you’re sick, I wouldn’t have said anything, but your sickness is also burdening your family. Your mother has to take time off work to take you to the doctor and send you home. She is not only busy, but also feels uneasy at work.” So, we should always be mindful of the weather and take care not to get sick. For example, when we exercise, we sweat a lot, so we need to remember to bring a towel and a change of dry clothes. When we care for our bodies in these ways, our parents will increasingly trust us.

Many teenagers say, “Why do my parents control me so much?” I would ask them, “Why do you think your parents control you so much?” It’s because your behavior does not put their minds at ease. If you take good care of yourself, your parents will feel at ease, and you will gain true freedom. If you don’t know how to take care of yourself, and your parents don’t remind you, then wouldn’t they be failing in their responsibility? So, we need to understand our parents' intentions and make ourselves more sensible, so that we can have true freedom while putting our parents’ minds at ease. Therefore, our lives should have routines. We shouldn't stay up late often. It takes many days to make up for just one night of staying up late. We should pay attention to our diet and our lifestyles, so that we can maintain good health.

A child who caught a cold wrote in his diary, "I caught a cold, and I am very sad. It's not because I’m feeling uncomfortable, but because it’s unfilial to get sick." You see, children who have embraced the teachings of *Di Zi Gui* have a different way of thinking and self-reflection than other children. The *Classic of Filial Piety* states, "*Shēn tǐ fà fū, shòu zhī fùmǔ, bù gǎn huǐ shāng, xiào zhī shǐ yě.*" (身體髮膚，受之父母，不敢毀傷，孝之始也) "Our bodies, down to our hair and skin, are received from our parents. We dare not harm them. This is the start of filial piety.” A person's filial piety begins with taking care of their own body.

“*Dé yǒu shāng, yí qīn xiū.*” (德有傷，貽親羞) "Harm to virtue causes parents shame." If our moral character is damaged, our parents will be very distressed and ashamed. When we have this in our minds, we won’t stray off the righteous path. We must always think about how our parents had so much hardship raising us, and we should strive to establish ourselves, follow the path of virtue, and bring honor to our parents, so that future generations can remember them. This great act of filial piety is not for when they are gone, but while they are still here. As long as you do your best, friends and family will be grateful to you. And when those words of gratitude reach your parents' ears, they will be greatly comforted. Besides not bringing shame to our parents, we also shouldn't bring shame to our country. So, by “*yí qīn xiū*” (貽親羞) we can extend that to mean that we shouldn’t bring shame to our nation.

When our morals are damaged, it brings shame to our parents and families, even potentially to our nation and ethnic group. At the end of the Han Dynasty, a minister named Dong Zhuo, when gaining power, used his position to cause chaos. Later, many people rose up against him. Dong Zhuo met a miserable end, and his family was executed. His mother, who was over ninety years old, was taken to the execution grounds and killed as well. If our behavior causes such great pain to our parents, we have not fulfilled our duties as their children. There is no such thing as “the annihilation of nine clans” penalty anymore, but if we make a mistake in our career, like our business failing, it could involve our parents. After working hard for most of their lives, they might end up losing their retirement savings and end up in court when they are old, which is truly tragic. As their children, we must be honest, stable, and not aim too high, causing mistakes that involve our parents. Therefore, “*dé yǒu shāng, yí qīn xiū*” (德有傷，貽親羞) “Harm to virtue causes parents shame."

If our moral character is constantly improving, using our virtues to benefit society and the country, then we will be doing as *The Classic of Filial Piety* says, "*lì shēn xíng dào, yáng míng yú hòu shì, yǐ xiǎn fùmǔ*” (立身行道，揚名於後世，以顯父母) “Establish yourself in virtue, follow the path of righteousness, make your name known in future generations, in order to bring honor to your parents.” This is the ultimate act of filial piety. Does “bringing honor to our parents” mean only after they’re gone? No! If you can make contributions to society while you’re young, your parents will be proud of you, and they will have peace of mind for the rest of their lives. Mencius said, “What is the greatest duty? To serve our parents is the greatest duty." "What is the greatest thing to protect? To protect oneself is the greatest." In other words, to protect our body and our reputation, to never do anything that is immoral or illegal, bringing shame to our parents. When our actions do not conform to morality, they will bring shame to our parents and family, and potentially even our next generation. Now, because the internet is so developed, communication is very frequent, and if we lack judgment and rationality, we are very likely to make mistakes that we regret our entire lives. Therefore, it is important to protect ourselves.

Many people in modern society talk about “one-night stands.” This not only brings shame to ourselves, but also makes it hard for our children to hold their heads up high. So, we need to be cautious in our words and actions and not humiliate ourselves. Why do people make these mistakes? For men, it may be because they are too indulgent. This stems from having no ambition from a young age, only wanting to indulge in pleasure. For women who make these mistakes, many are vain and like to hear sweet words. Many men with ill intentions use honeyed words to trick them into making a mistake. So, we need to examine ourselves and not make these mistakes. We need to teach our children not to be vain, and to have ambition in life. If they lead fulfilling and moral lives, they won't be swayed by the pollution of society and will not make these mistakes that cause regret for a lifetime.

**7. True Filial Piety Lies in Being Dutiful Even When Parents Don't Love Us or Are Too Strict**

*Qīn ài wǒ, xiào hé nán; qīn zēng wǒ, xiào fāng xián.* (親愛我，孝何難；親憎我，孝方賢) “When parents love us, filial piety is easy; when parents dislike us, that is when filial piety is truly virtuous.”

We do not want morals to decline, so we need to start with ourselves. Many people think, "Society has already become like this, it doesn't matter how hard I try, it will likely have no effect.” Is that thought helpful to the family or society? No, it is not! We should not underestimate our power. One person’s sincerity and virtue can awaken the kind nature of the people around them. For example, Emperor Shun (Da Shun) was very filial and had cultivated his character well. Even though his parents were mean to him, he still fulfilled his filial duties, because he knew “*qīn zēng wǒ, xiào fāng xián*” (親憎我，孝方賢), which means “when parents dislike us, that is when filial piety is truly virtuous.” It's not a transaction with your parents; you can't say that you won't be good to them if they are mean to you. We must always remember the kindness of our parents for raising us and we should repay it, instead of expecting our parents to be good to us, as filial piety is our duty. Because he had this attitude, his filial piety changed his family. Because he cultivated himself, he was able to govern his family. His virtues touched the hearts of everyone in his community, who followed his example and hoped to become his citizens. So, he was able to govern his family, and rule his country. The king at that time, Emperor Yao, was very touched and felt that if he entrusted the world to a person like that, the people would be happy, so he was able to govern the country and bring peace to the world. Therefore, when we truly cultivate ourselves, we can have a great impact on our families and society.

“*Qīn ài wǒ, xiào hé nán; qīn zēng wǒ, xiào fāng xián.*” (親愛我，孝何難；親憎我，孝方賢) “When parents love us, filial piety is easy; when parents dislike us, that is when filial piety is truly virtuous.” When our relationship with our parents is good, we should do our best to care for them. When parents are in a bad mood, we should be more tolerant and forgiving, because everyone's emotions fluctuate. When interacting with others, we should remember one principle, "Regardless of whether others are right or wrong, we have to do what is right." If our parents are in a bad mood, and we treat them badly, then our parents are wrong, and we are wrong as well! If we are in the wrong, how can we criticize others? So, whether it's our parents or our friends and family, even if they treat us with the wrong attitude, we should still treat them in the right way. Regardless of whether others are right or wrong, we have to do what is right. There were many sages in China, and it is because of this attitude that they were able to maintain their sincere filial piety in situations where their parents were not being kind to them. And because of this sincere filial piety, they were able to change the atmosphere of the family and bring harmony to the family.

In the Zhou Dynasty, there was a filial son named Min Ziqian. His mother had died early, and his father had remarried and had two more sons.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I have aimed for accuracy, natural English flow, and maintaining the nuances of the original text:

**A Stepmother's Cruelty and the Power of Filial Piety**

His stepmother was unkind to him. In the winter, she made cotton-padded coats for his two younger brothers but used reed catkins to make his clothing. The reed catkin clothes were large and bulky but not warm. It so happened that his father asked him to drive the carriage. The cold wind whistled past, and Min Ziqian shivered as he drove. His father, seeing him bundled in such thick clothes yet still trembling, thought people would assume the stepmother was mistreating the child, which would damage her reputation. Angered, he lashed out at Min Ziqian with a whip. But when the whip struck, the clothes tore open, and reed catkins flew out. The father was furious. "How could she mistreat my son like this?" he raged, rushing home intending to divorce his wife.

In this dire situation, Min Ziqian immediately knelt and begged his father not to send his stepmother away, saying, "With mother, only one son is cold; without mother, three sons will be alone and cold."  While his mother was present, only he suffered from the cold; if she left, both he and his two brothers would go hungry and freeze. These words deeply moved his father, and his anger subsided. His stepmother was ashamed. A child so young could be so mindful of his brothers and her, while she, an adult, was so petty and calculating towards a child. Min Ziqian's filial piety and virtue touched his stepmother, and from then on, the family lived in harmony.

If Min Ziqian had not shown such forgiveness, tolerance, and sincere filial piety towards his stepmother, what would have become of the family?  It could have been destroyed. Therefore, when facing reality, one must not act impulsively. If we repay malice with malice, the outcome will never be satisfactory. We must believe that "sincerity can penetrate metal and stone" and use our true filial devotion to create good drama in life.

There is a famous story in history called "Wang Xiang Breaking the Ice." A filial son named Wang Xiang was asked by his stepmother to catch fish for her to eat in the dead of winter. Was there any fish to be found on such icy and snowy days?  No! If Wang Xiang did not catch fish, he might be beaten, and his stepmother might not even let him inside the house. Despite his stepmother's treatment, he did not complain. He went to the icy expanse alone, shedding tears and hoping for a miracle. His sincerity moved the heavens and the earth; the ice broke open, and two fish jumped out. He took the two fish back to care for his stepmother. Even though she continued to be difficult in many ways, Wang Xiang did not waver. One time, when it was about to rain, his stepmother told him, "If any fruit falls from the trees because of the wind and rain, I will punish you." Wang Xiang ran out and embraced the trees, crying and pleading with them not to drop their fruit. His sincerity moved the trees, and indeed, only a few fruits fell. Even plants and minerals can be affected by human hearts.  Many situations were resolved because of Wang Xiang’s filial piety.

It’s not easy to touch and transform someone.  It takes a great deal of patience. Wang Xiang's filial piety moved his stepmother, not just when he was a child, but also when he was grown and married. His stepmother abused not only him but also his wife.  However, Wang Xiang's virtue moved his younger brother, Wang Lan, who was born to his stepmother.  Because of his virtue, his younger brother greatly respected him.  Whenever their stepmother abused Wang Xiang and his wife, Wang Lan would go with his wife to help his older brother. As Wang Xiang's virtue grew, his reputation spread far and wide. His stepmother, jealous and upset, even tried to give him poisoned wine. His younger brother discovered this, and in a moment of desperation, rushed over, snatched the poisoned wine, and tried to drink it himself. He used his own life to try and dissuade his mother. His mother immediately knocked the wine from his hand, and felt great shame.  Her son was willing to give his own life to protect his older brother.  This act awakened his mother’s conscience. The sincere devotion of the two brothers transformed their family.

At that time, there was a minister named Lu Qian who had a precious sword. He gifted it to Wang Xiang, saying that having this sword would bless his descendants to be successful. Wang Xiang’s first thought was not to keep it but to give it to his younger brother, wishing him a prosperous future for his children.  Indeed, with such brothers and such virtue, their descendants would be well-educated. As the *Book of Changes* says, "A family that accumulates good deeds is sure to have abundant blessings." Therefore, the descendants of Wang Xiang and Wang Lan held high government positions for nine generations, serving their society and nation. We must use a sincere heart to transform the imperfections of family life.

**8. When Parents Have Faults, We Should Counsel Them Properly**

*When parents err, we must counsel them to change, with a pleasant countenance and gentle words.*

Counseling our parents is a duty for every child.

Today, many criticize Chinese culture, saying, "Chinese culture emphasizes filial piety, so we must obey everything our parents say. Is this blind obedience?" In fact, if they have read the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, they would find the answer to this question.  When parents err, we must counsel them to change. This "obedience" refers to when our parents' suggestions and expectations are correct. We must do our best to fulfill them. But when our parents’ suggestions or actions are incorrect, we should tactfully advise them rather than confront them directly.

Advising should be based on trust. The appropriateness of our advice can be assessed from four perspectives: First, our motive; second, our attitude; third, using the right method and timing; and fourth, with great patience. In fact, these four attitudes are all covered in the teachings of the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*. Thus, “when parents err, we must counsel them to change” is an act of filial devotion. The right attitude is to have “a pleasant countenance and gentle words.” When advising our parents, can we speak to them as if they were children? No, our parents would definitely not accept that. So, we must have “a pleasant countenance and gentle words.”

We can broaden the meaning of “parents” to include all relatives and friends.  If they have made mistakes, we also have a responsibility to advise them.

There was a scholar named Sun Yuanjue. In his area, there was a terrible custom where elderly or sick parents were carried to the mountains and abandoned. Sun Yuanjue advised his father not to carry his grandfather up the mountain, but his father didn't listen.  Sun Yuanjue then carried his grandfather up the mountain with his father using a bamboo basket. After setting his grandfather down, his father was about to leave, but Sun Yuanjue picked up the bamboo basket. His father said, “Don’t take that basket, just leave it here.”  Sun Yuanjue replied, "No, I have to take it back. When you are old, I will use it to carry you up here.”  Upon hearing this, his father quickly took his grandfather back home. This was a very skillful and convenient way to advise his father.  We must always observe the situation and use gentle words to advise our parents.

*If advice is not heeded, we should advise again with joy, and if this is still rejected we may weep to show our heart, or even be beaten without resentment.*

Adults don’t form their thoughts and views overnight, so when our advice is not heeded, we must have unwearying patience, and “advise again with joy.” “Joy” here means we must choose the right time to advise them. We should wait until our parents are in a better mood before offering advice or observe when a leader is in a good mood before advising them. Do not advise them when they are in a bad mood because this may result in a scolding. We must consider the time and circumstance.

“Weep to show our heart, or even be beaten without resentment.” Even if our parents do not accept our advice, we should not harbor resentment because we are simply doing what we should be doing and therefore have a clear conscience. Advising our parents does not mean we should give up after one refusal. Such an attitude would mean that we had forgotten our duty as children. It is not important whether others are right or wrong; we must always remind ourselves if we have done the right thing and fulfilled our duty.

If, despite all that, they still don’t listen, we must use every means at our disposal. This is what “weep to show our heart” means. The story of “weeping to show our heart” comes from Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty. When Emperor Taizong was assisting his father in pacifying the realm, his father was about to take a route that he had predicted would lead them into an ambush.  He tried many times to advise his father to take another route. His father refused. On the day they were due to depart, his father suddenly heard someone crying loudly outside of his tent. Surprised, he came out and saw that Emperor Taizong was sitting on the ground, weeping uncontrollably.  Moved, his father changed the route. He had done his utmost to advise his father.  This one cry from Li Shimin changed the fate of the entire Tang Dynasty. Therefore, we must use the right methods for advising others.

**9. When Parents Are Ill, Children Should Care For Them With All Their Might**

*When parents are ill, we should taste the medicine first, attend to them day and night, and not leave their bedside.*

“When parents are ill, we should taste the medicine first.” When parents are sick, children should first taste the medicine to ensure it is not too hot before giving it to their parents.  This demonstrates how filial children take care of their parents when they are ill, always at their side. This story comes from Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty. We know about the "Reigns of Wen and Jing" during the Han Dynasty.  The reason these two emperors could govern so well was that they ruled with filial piety. In reality, managing a group, family, or even a nation is not as complicated as people think.  Emperor Wen’s mother was ill for three years. He personally attended to her, serving her medicine for those three years until her health improved.

In modern times, have you ever heard of children constantly at the bedside of their sick parents? Of course, there are. As people become increasingly unfilial, we can see who is truly filial, remaining steadfast despite the tides of time.  Like “Meng Zong’s Cry for Bamboo”, due to his sincere heart, the bamboo shoots grew in the winter.

In this regard, we can ask our children if their mother is ill, should they taste the medicine first? If the medicine is Chinese medicine, they can lick it to see if it’s too hot; if it’s western medicine, can they “taste the medicine first”? Therefore, when you grasp the meaning of each phrase of *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, you must apply them to the situations of our lives.  We need to guide our children further that, when serving a cup of water, they need to consider not to make it too cold or too hot.  We should also guide our children to think about how they should respond when their parents are sick or in an emergency situation.  By teaching our children how to respond to emergencies from a young age, they will understand how to handle situations calmly.

What aspects should we pay attention to?  Where is the medicine kept?  How to find the medicine in an emergency? If there are many medicines all over the place, will you be able to find it when you are in a panic? You might be in a fluster.  Next, what are the emergency numbers to call: 119 or 110? And what are the numbers of the closest relatives?  Children need to know these numbers so they know what to do in an emergency.  Furthermore, when parents are bedridden, children need to know how to care for them, giving them a chance to put it into practice.  I believe that, in the process of doing this, they will become more and more meticulous, and more able to understand the pain and needs of the patient. If we apply this to other situations and teach our children these methods and attitudes, we’ve understood the true meaning of “When parents are ill, we should taste the medicine first.”

Besides treating the illness, what else can we do to help patients recover more quickly?  This is a question that is worth pondering.  There is a saying that “Doctors can cure diseases, but not fate.” Many rich people do not live long lives.  Therefore, if we want longevity, we must seek it properly. Between heaven and earth, if you seek properly, you can receive it.

It is said, "All things arise from causes and conditions; by giving fearlessness, we attain health and longevity." “Fearlessness” means helping others avoid fear. For example, there was Ms. Xu Zhe of Singapore, who was 106 years old. She constantly helped others avoid illness and the pain of life, and she always took the initiative to help. She only learned nursing when she was in her fifties. Her spirit is truly admirable.  She always helps others to solve their problems. That is why she is so healthy and long-lived. At 106 years old, she walks briskly and speaks with great vigor. One could never tell she is over a hundred. Thus, we must verify truth for ourselves, and then we will have complete faith in it.

Before I went to Australia, my grandfather had a stroke. We rushed to the hospital, and the doctors said, “He is over eighty years old, and we don’t dare operate on him because all the blood vessels are blocked, not just one. You should prepare for his funeral." My father, my uncle, and my aunt are all very filial, but they panicked when they heard this news.  Because my grandfather did not have a history of heart disease, was tall and thin, and looked healthy, we did not realize there were already symptoms.  He had been feeling dizzy, but since he did not have high blood pressure, he had thought it was just a cold, and the symptoms were not discovered in time.

Seeing that the elders were in a state of panic, I said to my father, "Dad, by giving fearlessness, we attain health and longevity. Give me 50,000 yuan of Grandpa’s money and we will use it to give fearlessness, which will help him most directly." My father trusted me, and he gave me the money. I then went to the intensive care unit and communicated with my grandfather. “There are many poor people in the world, and many who are facing hunger. We still have the power to help them.” My grandfather nodded, but he couldn’t speak. I quickly donated the money for international disaster relief, helping those in need.  As a result, my grandfather moved from the intensive care unit to a regular ward after five days. Indeed, it is true that by giving fearlessness we can attain health and longevity.

After moving out of the regular ward, the doctor said, “An eighty-year-old who has had a stroke will most likely never walk again. You should prepare for that.” By that point, I had already resigned from my job to go to Australia for further study, and I made an agreement with my grandfather, "The next time I come back, you have to walk for me to see."  After I went to Australia, because the Pure Land Learning College was cultivating many teachers to promote the teachings of the sages, I donated some money there as well, in the name of my grandfather. On the day I completed the donation, I called my mother, and she said, "Your grandfather was able to walk today!"  Therefore, there are many truths we must seek to verify with a sincere heart. The sages never lie. “When parents are ill, we should taste the medicine first.” Besides treating his illness, we must also treat his fate. The more a person practices the act of giving fearlessness, the healthier they will become.

“Attend to them day and night, and not leave their bedside” is a behavior that shows the true heart of a filial child. If your health is not good, don’t force yourself to do so, you can also rest beside them, tying a string to yourself. If your parents need you, they can pull the string, and you can get up to care for them. We must know how to be flexible; it is not necessary to imitate Emperor Wen of the Han and never sleep.

**10. During Mourning, Express Our Grief; During Memorials, Show Our Respect**

*During mourning, we should grieve; for three years, we should feel sorrow, our home life should be altered, and we should refrain from meat and alcohol.*

"During mourning, we should grieve." This refers to those whose parents have passed away. The *Classic of Filial Piety* says, “In life, give our utmost respect; in caring for them, give them utmost joy; in sickness, give our utmost worry; in mourning, give our utmost grief, and during the memorial, give our utmost respect.” When a funeral takes place, we should feel gratitude for the kindness of our parents, and during memorial ceremonies, we should be solemn, not forgetting their teachings. This is the duty of a filial child.  Therefore, funerals should be solemn, not noisy and chaotic. Some people hire a lot of people to cry at a funeral. This is meaningless! Our hearts should always remember the kindness of our parents. Ouyang Xiu said it very well: “A lavish memorial is not as good as frugal care when they are alive.” No matter how good a memorial you have, it is more meaningful to care for your parents well when they are alive. To not care for them when they are alive, then spend a lot of money after they die, is truly backward!

Therefore, when parents are alive, we must cherish them and treat them well. When parents pass away, we will feel at peace and comforted because we tried our best. As an old saying goes, "The trees long to be still, but the wind will not stop; the child longs to care for parents, but parents are gone." We must never let such regret happen to us. If your parents have passed away, can you still express your filial devotion? Of course, you can. As long as you "establish yourself, practice the Way, and become famous in posterity," you can "honor your parents." Furthermore, we must do our best to teach our children well and make sure that our family line becomes better and better. This will bring comfort to our parents in heaven. Therefore, funerals should be solemn, and can be arranged according to the wishes of our parents. We can use funerals to remember the contributions that our parents made to our family and convey their expectations to our family.

"For three years" refers to the traditional mourning period. “We should feel sorrow”. Many people say, “To cry for three years, isn’t that exhausting?” This is misinterpreting the meaning, and the sages would cry injustice!  To “feel sorrow” is a natural emotion for a filial child. Because a filial child has had the kindness of his parents in his heart for decades, they will find it difficult to accept when their parents pass away. Whenever they think of their parents, their tears will naturally fall. This is what “feel sorrow” means.  Because of this sense of grief, their "home life should be altered, and they should refrain from meat and alcohol." Thus, "rites" are actually the natural expressions that arise from one’s heart. When parents pass away, will the child still be partying and living lavishly?  It is impossible. Since the parents have passed away, their "home life should be altered," and they will naturally refrain from lavish spending, meat, and alcohol, which is why “they should refrain from meat and alcohol.”

*During mourning, follow the proper rites; during memorials, be sincere; treat the departed as if they were still living.*

“During mourning, follow the proper rites; during memorials, be sincere.” “Memorial” refers to the fixed times every year to memorialize parents. This is a fine tradition of the Chinese people, which is why we have ancestral halls. *Zhu Zi’s Family Maxims* states, "Though ancestors are distant, our memorial ceremonies must not be insincere," and the *Analects* states, “Be conscientious at the end and give chase to those of the past, and the people’s virtue will return to its simplicity.” When we always remember that we are here today because of our parents and ancestors, and we always have this heart of gratitude, our hearts will naturally become more generous.

Memorial ceremonies must be conducted with the utmost sincerity, which does not need to be complicated but must be consistent, and serve as a good example for our children to learn from. There was a father who was very filial towards his parents. After his parents passed away, he would regularly go to their graves to sweep them, and his two children would witness it. One day, the kindergarten gave each of the children a piece of candy. They were delicious candy, but the children didn’t eat them. Instead, they brought them home to give to their father. Their father was very touched. His son said, “Dad, whenever Grandma and Grandpa were alive, you always gave them something to eat first. Even though they are gone, you often bring things to give to them. Today, our school gave us two candies, which we should also give to Dad.” This is the power of example and influence.

“Treat the departed as if they were still living.”  Our attitude toward our deceased parents should be no different than when they were living.  Our parents' expectations and teachings should not change because our parents have passed away. In fact, we should strive even harder to live up to their expectations and repay their nurturing kindness. A child's grandmother had passed away. As they sat in the hearse, the child's uncle was carrying his grandmother's ashes. The road was a bit bumpy, so his uncle immediately said to the driver, “Please drive slower, because my mother was not used to riding in cars that go so fast.” The child was very moved. When he returned to school, he asked his teacher, "Teacher, is my uncle's behavior “treating the departed as if they were still living”?”  Thus, children are very perceptive.

**II. Leaving Home: The Way of the Younger Brother**

1. *Treating Siblings with Affection, Not Fighting Over Food, Clothing, Books, or Toys.*

*Elders should be loving; younger siblings should be respectful. When siblings are harmonious, filial piety is manifested.*

When a person achieves “filial piety” and “fraternal love,” they can manage their family, govern a state, and bring peace to the world. Is this conclusion too exaggerated? Not at all, because “the great Way is simple.” While it may seem like a deep and complex theory, it is actually the most basic and simple principle. Throughout thousands of years of Chinese history, we know of the “800 years of the Zhou Dynasty," but we only know the outcome, and not the reason. We must investigate the reason, from which we can get good lessons and inspiration. The Zhou Dynasty had the longest history and flourished for 800 years. Why did the Zhou Dynasty last for 800 years? What was the reason? It was based on filial piety and fraternal love. The founding rulers of the Zhou Dynasty were King Wen of Zhou and King Wu of Zhou. King Wen’s father was the Grand King. The Grand King had three sons: the eldest, Taibo, the second, Zhongyong, and the third, Wang Ji. Wang Ji fathered King Wen of Zhou, who fathered King Wu of Zhou. When the Grand King saw the newborn King Wen, he felt King Wen was destined to be a sage ruler, but his father, Wang Ji, was the third son. According to the rules of succession, the heir to the throne should be the eldest son, Taibo.

This is the translation of the first portion of the provided text. It is lengthy, so let me know if you would like the rest of the book translated as well.


Okay, here is my translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for a professional and natural tone suitable for a book translation:

**Title: The Enduring Power of Filial Piety and Brotherly Love**

However, when Taibo saw the delight on his father's face at the sight of his grandson, he understood that his father intended to pass the throne to Wang Ji, hoping it would eventually be passed down to this grandson. Taibo, keenly perceptive of his father’s feelings, quietly took the excuse of gathering herbs for his father and arranged with his second brother, Zhongyong, to go up into the mountains. They never returned. He wished for his father not to be hindered by his status as the eldest son, and to directly pass the throne to his third brother, Wang Ji, and subsequently to King Wen of Zhou.

Their brothers’ actions of yielding the throne, understanding parental feelings, and fulfilling their father's wishes not only exemplified filial piety but also embodied brotherly affection and loyalty. This act of relinquishment allowed a sage to lead the nation, truly a display of virtue, and a testament to the family’s legacy. Confucius praised Taibo and Zhongyong, calling their actions "the pinnacle of virtue.” Only with such supreme virtue could such a selfless deed be accomplished.

Their filial piety was passed down; one family practicing filial piety inspires the nation to do so. When people see that the leaders they admire are so filial, they are moved to learn and emulate. *The Great Learning* states, “When one family embodies benevolence, the whole nation becomes benevolent; when one family practices yielding, the whole nation practices yielding.” Their act of deference inspired the entire nation, and as a result, many disputes naturally lessened. Thus, leaders' actions influence their subordinates, an effect beyond comprehension. Filial piety and brotherly love can bring harmony to a family, govern a state, and bring peace to the world.

Who do we spend the most time with in our lives? It is our siblings. Because our parents are decades older than us, while our siblings are closer in age, we spend the most time with our siblings. Sibling bonds are precious. Zen Master Fazhao once wrote a poem describing the bond between brothers: “Branches from the same breath flourish; words of little consequence must not wound affections. Every time we meet, we grow older. How many more times can we be brothers? Brothers living together, forbearance brings peace; do not let trivial matters start quarrels. The children before us become brothers, leaving an example for our children and grandchildren.” Parents are like the trunk of a tree, while siblings, nieces and nephews are like the branches and leaves extending from the same root. When there is conflict between brothers, parents suffer the most; therefore, “words of little consequence must not wound affections.” In our middle age, brothers may only see each other every few weeks or even months. When they do meet, “every time we meet, we grow older” – more wrinkles appear, more gray hairs emerge. Truly, “how many more times can we be brothers?” When brothers are together, “brothers living together,” as long as they take a step back and practice tolerance, “forbearance brings peace.” Do not let minor conflicts escalate. We have our own children, and they have their own siblings. The previous generation must set a good example for the next generation, "leaving an example for our children and grandchildren." Remember the ancient teaching: "In the home, avoid litigation, for litigation brings ruin," because a harmonious family leads to prosperity in all things.

The ancients deeply cherished and valued the bond between brothers. During the Jin Dynasty, there was a boy named Yu Gun. One year, a plague struck their region. One of his older brothers had already died from the plague, and another was sick. Everyone in the village was evacuating, including his parents and his uncles, who also wanted to take him with them. Yu Gun said to the elders, "I am not easily sick, so I am not afraid. I will stay behind to care for my sick brother." Sincere devotion can move even the heavens. He stayed behind to care for his brother and, at night, he also prayed for his deceased brother. Later, his sick brother recovered. Why did he recover? When brothers share such profound affection, every bowl of medicine is imbued with virtue, righteousness, and compassion, thus making it more effective. Later, his parents returned home and were overjoyed to find that both their sons were still alive. This is the story of the brotherly affection demonstrated by Yu Gun of the Jin Dynasty.

We see that the sages and wise men of ancient times were prepared to sacrifice their lives for righteousness, aligning themselves with the profound truths of the universe. When they faced life with righteousness, even if it meant death, they would surely find a favorable place. Conversely, those who violate righteousness, even if they cling to life, will descend to the three lower realms in the next life. More importantly, they will not live well in this life, burdened by their conscience. Throughout history, the sages who were willing to sacrifice their lives for righteousness often performed remarkable deeds, turning conflict into harmony and disaster into good fortune.

During the Tang Dynasty, there was a minister named Li Ji who made great contributions to the establishment of the Tang Dynasty under Emperor Taizong. Once, Li Ji fell ill, and the imperial physician prescribed medicine that required beard hair as an ingredient. Upon hearing this, Emperor Taizong did not hesitate, but immediately took a knife and cut off his own beard, giving it to the physician. Li Ji was deeply moved and kowtowed before the Emperor to express his gratitude. Indeed, when a leader always considers the well-being of his subordinates, he will surely earn their respect and devotion. Li Ji was also very filial toward his older sister. Even as a minister, when visiting his sister, he would personally cook porridge for her. Once, while cooking porridge, the fire was too intense, and he burned his beard. Upon seeing this, his sister said, “Why did you burn your beard? We have plenty of servants at home, why didn't you let them do it?” Li Ji replied, "Sister, you have taken such good care of me since I was young. I always want to repay you. We are both getting old, how many more chances will I have to cook porridge for you myself?" Li Ji never forgot the love and bonds between siblings. These are the great dramas played out in ancient times.

King Wu of Zhou and the Duke of Zhou also carried on the brotherly love of their uncles, Taibo and Zhongyong. Once, King Wu fell ill, so the Duke of Zhou wrote a prayer before their ancestors (in the ancestral temple), asking that his own lifespan be shortened so that his elder brother, King Wu, could live longer. This demonstrates not only his brotherly affection but also his hope that his brother would be healthy and able to govern the nation well. As soon as the Duke of Zhou finished his prayer, it was so sincere that it reached the heavens, and King Wu’s health improved. This prayer was then kept in the ancestral temple.

While King Wu was alive, he chose the Grand Preceptor Jiang Taigong and the Grand Protector Duke of Zhou to be the teachers of his son, King Cheng. Whether a person becomes successful in life often depends on whether their parents choose good teachers for them. Today, our children, and we ourselves, already have a great teacher: the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, which can significantly improve our family values and pass them down through generations.

With such excellent teachers guiding him, King Cheng was able to govern the country well when he grew up. However, many rumors spread, claiming that the Duke of Zhou wanted to usurp the throne. To dispel these rumors, the Duke of Zhou, without waiting for King Cheng to say anything, voluntarily went to Shandong. One day, as King Cheng was walking, he saw unusual phenomena in the sky and immediately reflected: was it wrong for him to agree with his uncle’s departure from the capital to Shandong? People of the past were simple and sincere. They remembered the teachings of their ancestors, emphasizing “careful attention to the end and remembrance of origins, thus bringing back the people to their natural honesty.” Consequently, King Cheng went to the ancestral temple to confess. During the confession, King Cheng noticed the prayer that the Duke of Zhou had written for his brother, King Wu. He picked it up and read it, discovering that his uncle had been willing to shorten his own lifespan in the hopes of extending the life of his brother. King Cheng was deeply moved and immediately, as the Emperor, personally led his officials to escort the Duke of Zhou back to the capital. Thus, the brotherly respect and love of King Wu and the Duke of Zhou was passed down to their descendants. The Zhou Dynasty was able to last for 800 years because of its tradition of filial piety and brotherly love.

People of ancient times knew that when unusual phenomena appeared in the sky, it was proof that the Emperor had done something wrong. This was not superstition. The human heart is connected to heaven and earth, and when people are good, there will be favorable weather. When people are bad, there will be endless disasters. Today, the world is plagued by both natural and man-made disasters. When we see unusual phenomena in the sky, we should also reflect inwardly, protect our hearts, and strive to do good.

Once, while lecturing in Xiamen, I arranged for teachers to share their insights after the lesson. One teacher began by saying, "After listening to this lecture, I now understand that the foundation of virtue is filial piety." He continued by sharing his personal experience with the power of filial piety. In his village, there were several dozen families, totaling 109 descendants. Out of those 109 descendants, 108 had graduated from university; the one exception had attended university for two years but had dropped out due to certain circumstances. So the subsequent generations of this village were educated to a university level or higher. Why? He explained that every Chinese New Year, all the children in this generation did not go out to play; they took their parents to the temple to pray and seek blessings. This practice embodied filial piety. After the parents finished praying, they would visit all the neighbors and elders to offer their New Year greetings, which is a sign of respect for elders and valuing the virtuous. Afterward, they would gather at the local school to discuss their progress in their studies and careers for the past year. They would learn from each other and improve together. This is brotherly love. This atmosphere of filial piety and brotherly affection had led to such wonderful results. Thus, nothing happens by chance. A healthy family tradition relies on leaders setting an example for subordinates, and we must not leave the education of our children to chance.

As the saying goes, "All within the four seas are brothers." When giving lectures in mainland China, many children, being only children, would wonder, "But I don’t have any siblings." We would further explain that our cousins are also our siblings. We would draw a diagram showing how the extended family is like a large tree with many branches. You might be here, and another classmate might be over there, but if you trace it up the tree, you will see that you have the same ancestors; you all come from the same root. As descendants of the Yellow Emperor, all classmates and fellow citizens should love and respect each other, ensuring that our children do not develop discriminatory attitudes. Only then will our ancestors be pleased.

We all share the same mother. Heaven is like a father, and Earth is like a mother. All living beings grow because of the nurturing of the Earth. We all live together on the same Earth, so we all share the same mother. We must love all people and even all living things. This embodies the path of filial piety and brotherly love, embodying love and respect for our fellow beings.

The family must be established on a foundation of equality to achieve harmony. If there is inequality in treatment, people’s hearts will not be at peace, leading to conflict. Today, even small families of two or three people experience conflict, while in ancient times, families of hundreds of people could live together for over ten generations in peace. Therefore, we should learn from the ancients, who understood the mindset necessary for hundreds of people to live harmoniously together.

During the Ming Dynasty, the minister Zheng Lian’s family spanned seven generations, with 1,000 people living together. The emperor was delighted and amazed that a family could live in such harmony. He bestowed upon them the title of "The Best Family Under Heaven." He also sent him two large pears, with guards following to see how he would distribute them amongst 1,000 people. Zheng Lian calmly instructed his servants to bring in two large water basins, placing one on either side, and to mash the pears, allowing the juice to flow into the basins. Then he announced, "Everyone, come and have a bowl." Everyone felt this was fair. Closer relatives, seeing Zheng Lian's impartiality, held him in awe. More distant family members were equally impressed and respectful, seeing the elder’s fair treatment. Therefore, equality is the most important condition for governing a family well.

How can people live together harmoniously? Let us consider the example of a scholar named Chen Fang in the Song Dynasty. Thirteen generations of his family lived together, with over 700 people. They followed the teachings of their ancestors, not dividing their assets, and they did not hire any servants; they did all the work themselves. Every meal, all 700 people would eat together, creating a lively scene. Today, even families of three struggle to get along! We have indeed regressed. Some couples even fight before having children. The Chen family's ability to accommodate 700 people is truly impressive. The key to harmonious coexistence lies in “equal treatment.” When there is equal treatment, hearts are at peace, and conflicts are minimized. When raising children, we must hold to one principle: provide equal care. We must never favor one son over another. Throughout China's history, many parents have caused discord among their sons by favoring one child over another. Unequal treatment will inevitably lead to disputes.

Let's explore this deeper: if we favor one child over another, is that helpful to them? Do not think that because you are good to them, they will be good to you in return. You are wrong! If you spoil them too much, they will become more and more selfish, harming them in the long run. The child we neglect will feel unbalanced and may become resentful. As a result, you are doing harm to both sides. This is not rational; therefore, “equality” is crucial. Although I am an only son, my father treated all three of us children equally. When there were bonuses to give out, they were always the same amount; I never got more. Otherwise, I might have become spoiled.

When a family is filled with an atmosphere of brotherly love and respect, the family will surely prosper. Furthermore, this filial piety and brotherly love are not only moving for people, but even the animals in the family will be moved. In the Chen family, there were 100 dogs, who would wait just like their owners, until all the dogs had arrived before eating. This exemplifies the saying, "If one dog is not present, none will eat." This type of filial and fraternal devotion moved the dogs in their family. If you were a neighbor and witnessed this, what would you think? You would be touched. Moreover, you might reflect on how your family was still embroiled in squabbles and disputes, realizing that you were worse than even the dogs! News of this impressive scene eventually reached the Emperor, who was so touched that he exempted their entire family from all forced labor. A person's virtue can even move dogs. Some people say, "I don't believe it." Many people today find it difficult to believe in such profound interactions, because they hold cynical and petty views. They might say, "I don't experience these things, so why would they?" They do not consider the intentions of the sages.

I am fortunate that I have two older sisters who have taken special care of me. My eldest sister happened to attend the same university as I did. I remember when I was not well, I needed to take traditional Chinese medicine. One large package of herbs needed to be simmered for over an hour, reducing a large pot of water into a small bowl of medicine. At that time, I was a freshman living in a dormitory, where cooking was prohibited. So, my sister would cook the medicine twice a day, morning and evening, in her place off-campus. When it was ready, she would carry the bowl of hot medicine from the gates of the school and walk a long way to my dorm. She couldn’t enter the male dorm, so she would knock at my window and gesture for me to come and get my medicine. When I saw this, I felt almost completely better, and I would quickly go out and drink the bowl of medicine filled with my sister's love and care. This profound brotherly and sisterly love put my parents’ minds at ease. Therefore, "When brothers are harmonious, filial piety is at the core." The principles of brotherly love and respect should be practiced not only in the family but also in school, at work, and in the community.

**“When material things are valued lightly, where does resentment arise? When words are restrained, anger dissipates.”**

There was an ancient boy named Kong Rong who, at the age of four, would give the bigger pear to his older brother when eating fruit. This act is a celebrated anecdote in Chinese history. Kong Rong gave the bigger pear to his older brother, and the older brother, receiving such generosity, loved his younger brother even more. Kong Rong was willing to give the bigger pear because he profoundly understood the principles of “filial piety,” “brotherly love,” and “giving.”

During the Five Dynasties period, there was a scholar named Zhang Shixuan. His father had passed away, and he had been raised by his uncle since childhood. When he turned seventeen, his uncle said to him, "You are grown now. I will divide our property in two, one for you and one for me." But Zhang Shixuan immediately said to his uncle, "Uncle, you have seven children. You should divide the property into eight shares." His uncle replied, "No, you represent your father, so it should be divided into two shares." Zhang Shixuan insisted that it be divided into eight shares. By yielding in this way, what did he achieve? He manifested his virtue, created harmony in the family, and demonstrated his magnanimity; the greater the capacity, the greater the blessing. Consequently, when he went to the capital to take the imperial examinations, he encountered a fortune teller. The fortune teller, noticing the many “hidden virtues” on Zhang Shixuan’s face, said to him, "You will certainly pass with honors this time." As it turned out, he indeed succeeded in the examination.

Zhang Shixuan’s conduct was in harmony with his true nature. Understand that “if you are destined to have something, it will come to you. If it is not, don’t try to force it.” To understand the truth of fate, one must study the *Liaofan’s Four Lessons*, understand its principles, and cultivate a peaceful heart so as to avoid contention. When Mr. Yuan Liaofan was young, he met a very accurate fortune teller named Master Kong. Master Kong was a descendent of Shao Zi, who was famed for his accurate predictions. If your fate has been accurately predicted, you have lived your life in vain! This demonstrates that you have not lived your life to its fullest potential, nor have you made any worthy contributions. Why can fate be so accurately predicted? Because the good and bad deeds of a person manifest in their lives.

However, there are two types of people whose fate cannot be accurately predicted: those with immense goodness and those with immense wickedness. The actions of most people, however, are limited to small acts of kindness and small acts of wrongdoing. Because they do not expand their hearts and remain preoccupied with concerns for their sons, grandchildren, wives, homes, and money, they do not engage in significant acts of good or evil. Therefore, their fate can be predicted accurately. Fate includes operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, if your fate dictates that you will have ten million, but then you do one small act of kindness, ten million will increase by, say, five hundred thousand, making the prediction very accurate. If you perform a small act of evil, the sum will decrease to nine million five hundred thousand. The prediction will still be relatively accurate. However, if all you do is good deeds, then the ten million will multiply many times over, perhaps to fifty million, making the prediction very inaccurate. If you commit acts that are harmful to heaven and earth, then the ten million might be divided by five, reducing it to two million, which would also invalidate the accuracy of the prediction.

Therefore, it is important to understand that even if one steals property through illegal means, that wealth is likely something they were already destined to have. They might rejoice in having gained two million, but they have actually lost eight million. Hence, “a virtuous person is happy to be virtuous” because their conscience is clear; conversely, "a petty person suffers for being petty." They may have obtained two million, but because they broke the law, they may soon be imprisoned. Modern society is driven by utilitarianism, and many people are willing to take risks. When we see such people, we should feel pity for them; they are probably destined for great blessings but, lacking good education, ruin their lives. We should have pity on them because their elders did not teach them, "If one's ancestors were not virtuous, and were not aware of morality, and did not pass these teachings on, then this is not surprising." Therefore, understanding fate brings inner peace, and you can “value material things lightly, where does resentment arise?" This creates a harmonious family atmosphere.

**2. When Eating, Sitting, or Walking, Elders Should Precede**

**Whether eating, sitting, or walking, elders come first, the young follow behind.**

Today, people talk about equality; we should be equal with our children. Is that correct? That depends on your understanding. With respect to their personhood, we should treat them equally; we should respect their individuality, and they should not be regarded as merely an extension of ourselves. However, children are still young, and their life experiences and wisdom are not equal to ours. We need to guide and teach them. Therefore, there should be a hierarchy of age and seniority, so that children can develop a respectful attitude toward elders. If everyone is on the same level, how can they develop respect for us? Thus, we need a correct understanding of equality.

“Eating, sitting, and walking” are all essential parts of life. When children have a sense of age hierarchy, they will understand that “whether eating, sitting, or walking, elders come first, the young follow behind.” When there is good food, the elders should always eat first. Decades ago, families always waited for their grandparents and fathers to come home before starting to eat. Why? Because the livelihood of the family was the result of the father’s hard work. As children, they must respect and appreciate their father's efforts, and of course, invite the father to eat first. If the father had not yet returned from work, the son would not rudely begin eating. If a parent fails to take this opportunity to educate a child, over time, the child will simply do as they please. "If a child is not taught, his innate nature will change." This is why it is so difficult to educate modern children.

**Title: The Importance of Respect and Virtue in Daily Life: Insights from Traditional Chinese Teaching**

We need to carefully study why hundreds of people in the past could be so disciplined and follow the rules. Where does their method lie? In the *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child)! Only by truly practicing it can you receive its benefits. Therefore, all the rituals mentioned here aim to constantly elevate people's filial piety and respect.

Children who have received a classical education understand that food should first be offered to elders. We also teach children how to sit at the table when eating. The main seat must always face the entrance because the person sitting there can oversee the entire dining area or space. Therefore, the main seat should be given to the elder. The younger generation should sit as close to the door as possible, so they can assist whenever there is something to handle, such as serving dishes. Teachers also instruct them that if there are patterns on the table, the lines should not point toward the person in the main seat, as this is impolite. Children will immediately put into practice what they learn. Once, I was having a meal with these children, and as I sat down, they immediately started adjusting the table. They said that the lines should not point towards Teacher Cai. Such attention to fine details shows the children's respect.  When facing significant matters, they will be calm and composed. Cultivating children's good nature through these small details is exceptionally important.

Regarding “or eating and drinking” (or *yin shi*), we must also learn to be adaptable. When eating together, people often offer food to each other, sometimes even across the table. But when you reach over, everyone becomes anxious, concerned about getting their clothes dirty.  If it's too far and inconvenient, it’s enough to show good intentions. Being adaptable means having that intent: offer a bit of food, and then let everyone help themselves to what they want. This way, you avoid the awkward situation of force-feeding someone something they don’t like.  If you are seated with a teacher or elder, and they are busy communicating with many friends while eating, we can actively serve them and help them pick food, as they may have less time to do so. Therefore, we must always be alert and observe the situation.

A child, after learning the *Di Zi Gui*, went to a friend's house with his mother. His mother was standing while taking a call. The child told her, "Mom, please sit down while you talk on the phone." His mother said, "You go ahead and sit." He then said, "Mom, please sit." His mother responded, "I told you to sit, why aren't you listening?" He said, "Mom, if you don’t sit, I can’t sit."  Learning from the sages first requires honesty.  Such honesty will help a child achieve great things.  As elders, we need to nurture this virtue. So, when a child offers you a seat or picks food for you, accept it joyfully.

In Haikou and Shenzhen, the children we teach press the elevator buttons and let the teacher go first. But we tell them, “You should get on the elevator first.” Why? Because the children are small, and we are worried they might not control the doors properly and cause danger. While there is a principle, one must also be flexible. Once, a child joined our group of teachers in Shenzhen for a lecture. This child was remarkable, having studied the classics for several years.  He had a round face and large ears. You could tell at a glance that he was very blessed. What is the greatest blessing? To hear the teachings of the sages – that’s the most significant fortune in life. During our lectures, someone gave us a box of pastries, ten in total. They were delicious, and we each ate one. This child ran out of his room and said, "These pastries are delicious! Are there any more?” After eating nine, there was one left. He picked up the last pastry and came to me saying, "This one should go to Teacher Cai." He not only let the elders eat first, he could also discern who should be given priority next.

“When eating and drinking or sitting and walking, elders first, juniors after.” This habit cultivates children’s respect, and it will also help them in their future careers. We once spoke to a kindergarten director who told us that she had hired several teachers in their early twenties to teach.  On one occasion, when she hosted clients from Guangdong, she also brought some of these teachers to dinner. Several of these teachers were from Hunan, where spicy food is preferred, whereas people in Guangdong do not eat spicy food.  When ordering, she selected Guangdong dishes. As they started to eat, these teachers began complaining that the food was unpalatable. They were there to take care of the guests, but they were creating trouble.  Finally, when a spicy dish was served, the director turned it towards the clients.  As the client took a bite, the teachers immediately turned it towards themselves to eat. The director turned it back to the clients again, and the teachers turned it back to themselves. Would you dare employ such people? They are more likely to cause problems than solve them! When a child displays proper etiquette in every situation, you can confidently entrust them with tasks.  When managers take subordinates to a banquet, they always bring those who serve food well and pour drinks correctly. These good habits are formed from childhood and become invaluable later in life. As parents, we should also adopt this mindset and pave the way for our children's future. Though this etiquette may seem like a small detail in life, its most important purpose is to cultivate children’s respect. True learning lies in intention and always considering others, this is the highest level of learning.

Fan Zhongyan named his eldest son Fan Chunren. As parents, their care for their children was meticulous. Even choosing a name was part of the education. In Chinese culture, names represent parents’ hopes for their children, a constant reminder for them. Fan Zhongyan named his son Chunren, hoping his child would always possess a compassionate heart. The character "仁" (ren, benevolence) is a compound character with “人” (person) on the left and “二” (two) on the right. Which two people? You need to think of others as you think of yourself. Thus, “do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.” “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” “Seek your own benefit by benefiting others, seek your own success by helping others succeed.” When children understand from a young age that this is what their father expects of them, they will naturally encourage and urge themselves in this direction.

Fan Chunren truly did not disappoint his father's expectations. Once, Fan Zhongyan told him, “I have 500 *dou* (bushels) of wheat. Please transport them back to my ancestral home in Jiangsu.” Along the way, Fan Chunren encountered the parents of his father's old friend who had passed away. They were penniless and in desperate need of burial money. Fan Chunren immediately sold all 500 *dou* of wheat. Still, the money wasn’t enough, so he sold the boat used for transporting the wheat to gather sufficient funds for these elders.

After taking care of things, Fan Chunren returned to the capital to report what had happened. When he mentioned selling the 500 *dou* of wheat and that the money was not sufficient, Fan Zhongyan raised his head and said to his son, "Then you should have sold the boat too!" Fan Chunren replied, "Father, I already did." This shows the harmony between father and son and is why the family was able to prosper for generations. The Fan family possessed a compassionate heart, and thus, they had great blessings.

What cultivates learning is this intentionality, this heart of benevolence, this respect. Why is it said that studying can change one’s temperament? Where does this change come from? From the heart! For example, when children recite the *Di Zi Gui* and learn "when eating and drinking or sitting and walking, elders first, juniors after. When an elder is standing, a junior should not sit; when an elder is seated, then one may sit," they gradually put these teachings into practice. As children practice these teachings, they gradually internalize them, and their respect becomes more ingrained. As their respect solidifies, their temperament naturally changes. Therefore, if a child reads the classics but doesn't practice them, will their temperament change? The effect will be limited; therefore, practice is essential to learning.

If you were given a very delicious chocolate right now, who would you think of giving it to first? During one of my classes, I received three different answers. A young man in his thirties sitting in the front row said, "I'd eat it quickly." He was very honest. A lady in her forties in the next two rows said, "I would save it for my child." Further back, an elder in his sixties or seventies said, "I would give it to my parents first." Among these three, which one is truly cultured? The sixty-year-old is cultured.

I often ask children, "Does a university graduate have culture?" They immediately answer yes. I then ask, "Does someone who is not filial to their parents have culture?" They say no. I then say, "Does a university graduate who is not filial to their parents have culture?" They cannot answer this question because their understanding is flawed. True culture and moral cultivation are revealed in the initial thought of a moment. The thirty-year-old, whose first thought was of himself, was self-centered. The forty-year-old thought of the child. People today would enthusiastically say, "That's right!" If you were in the same position 200 years ago, you would not say the same thing, and people would think that you lacked wisdom. By giving the delicious treat to the child first, you have given the child a wrong example, reinforcing that they are the most important and cultivating selfishness.  However, if you give the chocolate to the grandparents, and the child witnesses how happy it makes them, the child will be moved.  This will instill in the child the virtue of filial piety.

Where should teaching children begin? From picking food. Great wisdom lies in small matters, and every action serves as a model for a child to learn. When you pick up a dish and say to your father, "Dad, eat more of this," your child sees their father practicing filial piety and is deeply moved because everyone has a good nature. The *Great Learning* states, “Knowing what comes first and what comes after is approaching the Tao.” When the order of things is correct, the way can be established. Therefore, if you serve the food correctly, you teach children the correct way to be a filial son or daughter.

When we open the refrigerator and take out fruit, who should eat first? Because my father served fruit correctly, I am now able to stand here and give this lecture. If my father had made the mistake of serving me first as a child, I would not be able to stand here and speak today. A small difference can lead to a vast divergence. Does serving a piece of fruit have such a severe impact? When we were young, we saw that our parents always gave the fruit to our grandparents first, and we naturally learned by example. I was an only child, the eldest grandson, and the eldest great-grandson.  I remember going to my great-grandmother's grave when I was three or four. After kneeling down, I looked up and noticed my name was engraved first on the tombstone. My eyes lit up, and suddenly I straightened my back and felt a sense of mission: I would do my best for the family’s success. There is a reason why Chinese culture values the eldest son and eldest grandson! It is because, in every generation, someone needs to set a good example and guide the family, so that it can prosper. If my parents had spoiled me and my grandparents had also spoiled me, I would not have been able to study the teachings of the sages, and I would have squandered everything by now. Therefore, the education of children is critical.

When a child knows to respect their elders, their respect will manifest in every aspect of their daily life. For example, when a child sees food and gives it to their elders first, their virtue is elevated in this act of sharing. We had a seven-year-old student who used to always have his grandparents pick food for him. Although he had only been reading the classics for a week, he returned home and proactively picked food for his grandparents and family.  His family members were so delighted and impressed by this change that they began to admire Chinese culture.  Therefore, if we educate children well, they can also positively influence their parents.

**3.  Guests Should Be Received Warmly and with Courtesy**

*“When an elder calls for someone, you should go and call them; if they are not there, you should go yourself.”*

In ancient times, when families were large, when a guest arrived at the house, they might be looking for a grandparent or uncle. As a younger person, we must proactively ask, "Who are you looking for?" If the guest is looking for an uncle, the child must "go and call them," running to find the uncle rather than letting the guest wait. If the uncle is not present, "you should go yourself," returning to the guest and saying, “My uncle is not here. Is there anything I can help you with, or anything you would like me to pass along?”  It’s likely that people travel a long distance, and it is said: "No one visits the temple without a reason." There must be a matter to be addressed.

How do children in modern families treat guests? For instance, if a guest arrives and a child is playing on the computer, they might yell out in a loud voice, "Mom, Auntie is here!" Is this proper behavior? Once it becomes a habit, they become careless and casual. They have prioritized playing over respecting elders, and over time, they lose their sense of respect. Therefore, we must teach our children the proper etiquette.  If they fail to learn it, they may face awkward situations at school or at work later in life.

The classics should not only be explained but should be practiced with the children. We have them practice receiving guests one by one, repeatedly, until they become proficient.  One day, at lunchtime, an auntie came to visit. As she walked towards the classroom, all the children, who were eating, put down their bowls and chopsticks and rushed forward to receive her. When children can apply what they've learned, they become delighted in it.  As the auntie reached the door, six children lined up and bowed together, saying, "Hello, Auntie!" The auntie was hesitant to come in, saying, "I am overwhelmed." She had never been greeted with such a grand display of courtesy.  She continued, saying, "If the next generation of children behaves like this, we would be so gratified."

Next, we teach the children how to place slippers. How should they be placed? In a place where guests can easily put them on as they walk in. Teaching children such acts of courtesy involves considering the needs of others. Children’s kindness is cultivated in the small details of everyday life. As the auntie enters, they will say, "Auntie, please sit down, and I will get you some water.” After inviting her to sit, they will say, "Auntie, please have some tea, and I will go and get my mom.” This is the etiquette for receiving guests and should be practiced at home.

At school, if children see a teacher from another class walk by, they may just stand there and yell, "Teacher, the teacher from the other class is looking for you!" This is not proper etiquette. Therefore, we must teach them that they must say, "Teacher, please wait a moment, and I will get our teacher for you." After telling their teacher, they should then bring the teacher over, completing the task from beginning to end.

When children conduct themselves this way from a young age, you can be confident in the tasks you entrust to them. Therefore, we should not underestimate etiquette. It shows that when children face a situation, they will handle it from beginning to end, completing the task thoroughly. When children put etiquette into practice, their minds will become less agitated and impatient, and their patience and composure will be cultivated.  Thus, practicing these manners in everyday life nurtures children's character.

The etiquette of receiving guests is not only relevant at home and school, but also at work, in companies, and even in government offices. Civil servants in government offices might be receiving important people from various countries.  If these civil servants do not follow proper etiquette, the country may lose face internationally. Therefore, etiquette is indeed very important. Confucius said, “Without learning etiquette, it is difficult to be successful.” Without proper etiquette, it is difficult to find a place in society.  Therefore, this passage can also be interpreted as the etiquette of receiving guests.

**4.  Interacting with Elders Should Be Humble and Respectful**

*“When referring to an elder, do not call them by their given name. When facing an elder, do not show off your abilities.”*

"When referring to an elder, do not call them by their given name." This shows respect. I recall that at home I would always call my two older sisters "Big Sister" and "Second Sister". Once, a friend asked, “What are your sisters’ names?”  When I told him, I felt uncomfortable, as if I had been disrespectful. Therefore, we must not underestimate such titles. When you use them habitually, people become more affectionate. Calling someone "sister" or "brother" will create more warmth. But if you call them by their given name, such as how spouses sometimes call each other by their full names, the atmosphere will gradually become cold and sometimes even explosive.  Therefore, we should refer to our elders as "Uncle," "Auntie," or "Grandpa," "Grandma." In the workplace, we should address people as "Manager So-and-so" or "Chairman So-and-so." This makes them feel comfortable and avoids offending them.

Children today should apply such etiquette at home and school. For example, as teachers, we should not refer to each other by our given name in front of children; saying "Teacher Lixu" or "Teacher So-and-so" directly is not appropriate. How should we address each other? As "Teacher Chen" or "Teacher Cai." This is also a demonstration to the children. Although we, as adults, may use more casual forms of address amongst ourselves, we must be mindful that children must learn humble attitudes from a young age. As teachers, we must also pay attention to these details. This is what “When referring to an elder, do not call them by their given name” means. In Western countries, people refer to their parents by their first names, and many people think that the Western way is better. A friend of ours, after reading books that suggested direct address, instructed his daughter to call him and his wife by their first names. After a few years of this, when I went to Haikou to teach *Di Zi Gui*, he realized he had made a mistake! His daughter was already communicating with him as an equal, making it difficult to teach her. Therefore, the way we address each other is intended to establish the hierarchy between elder and junior, and this etiquette should not be discarded.

“When facing an elder, do not show off your abilities.” When we see a child improve their talent, we must guide them and ask what the purpose of their talent is. The goal is what will ultimately guide the child.

I had a sixth-grade student who was taking four different tutoring classes. I thought, if she concentrated in class, there would be no need for so much tutoring, so I spoke with her. I said, "Four tutoring classes are too many, how about just two for now?" The young girl responded, "Teacher, I can't do that, everyone in my neighborhood takes four tutoring classes." You see, what was her purpose for the extra classes? It was to keep up with the Joneses. Likewise, why do people learn so many talents today? “Everyone can play the piano, so I have to as well. Everyone can dance, so I have to as well.” If learning is just for competition and to save face, then the talents learned won't be of much benefit, because learning so many things will result in a shallow knowledge. Not only will it not help, it might also lead to the practice of vanity. After learning a talent, you will always feel the urge to show it off. Therefore, parents’ attitudes are crucial. If children learn art, we should guide them to have a higher purpose. Talents should benefit others, and a society and nation is a cooperative body in which everyone contributes their skills and talents to benefit the whole. We need to guide children.  For example, the music of Li Shutong still continuously cultivates people’s temperament. If you learn music, you should have a high aim like Li Shutong who strived to, "Improve customs and change people's ways of life with music." When we guide children in this way, they will have a sense of purpose, and their learning will certainly be different from others. If they learn only for the purpose of showing off, they will inevitably hit a bottleneck and be unable to progress. When children focus on competing with others, they become prone to worry and their emotions become unstable. But, when children have a sense of purpose, they will encourage themselves and continually strive forward. Therefore, a clear sense of purpose is the key to success.

In the *Zhu Zi Family Precepts,* it’s mentioned that the goal of reading should be to become a sage or virtuous person.  However, nowadays, people read with the goal of making money. Because of this incorrect goal, people suffer when they study and feel frustrated, which causes them to do poorly in exams. Likewise, many people learn art to make money; therefore, their skills will never improve. We must grasp the fundamentals. What was Fan Zhongyan's purpose in studying? To gain the chance to serve the people. Therefore, his mindset was entirely different from those who studied only for personal gain, and the outcome would certainly be very different.

Okay, here is the English translation of the provided text, aiming for accuracy and natural flow, while maintaining a professional tone:

**The Importance of a "Careful Beginning" in Education: Guiding Children with the Right Mindset**

Education begins with a "careful beginning." When we guide children in developing their talents and skills, we must instill the right values. Therefore, perceiving one's abilities should cultivate humility. The *I Ching’s* sixty-four hexagrams mention “The Hexagram of Humility,” which is deemed auspicious in all six lines. Similarly, the *Book of Documents* states, "Fullness invites loss; humility receives benefit."  Thus, a child who understands humility can be successful in all endeavors.  In the four important philosophical essays of *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*, the fourth lesson describes the benefits of humility.  Mr. Yuan Liao Fan, when preparing for his imperial examinations, observed other students. He noticed that some were particularly humble, radiating an aura of respect, and treating others with utmost courtesy and modesty. Even if these students were young, he felt certain they would pass. The examination results confirmed this; the humble candidates all passed. Therefore, we must constantly remind children to cherish humility from a young age.  Even if our talents are exceptional, they are not self-made.  They result from the care and guidance of many people throughout our growth.  The more talented we are, the more grateful we should be for the sacrifices others have made for us. With such a mindset, arrogance will naturally diminish.

**5.  Proactively Greeting Elders and Teachers**

>  "When meeting an elder, approach quickly and bow. If they do not respond, step back and stand respectfully."

When we encounter elders on the street, we should proactively approach them and greet them. I remember my mother telling me, "Some of my former students would hide from me when they saw me in the street, rather than come and greet me." What causes such behavior? There are many possibilities. For example, the teacher may not have a close enough relationship with the children, causing them to run away. Alternatively, a child might not have learned to greet adults since childhood, thus lacking social graces. Therefore, we must teach children that when encountering elders, they should approach them, greet them, and bow—this is proper etiquette.

Is bowing easy? Today, asking someone to bow at ninety degrees might be difficult for many.

There was a kindergarten in Shenzhen that trained its students to bow. After about one or two months, there was one boy whose mother had three sisters, while his father’s four siblings had no children. He was the only grandchild, spoiled by many, including his paternal and maternal grandparents. Was this child easy to raise? No! He was overly indulged. His grandfather once told the family, “Seeing this grandson is like seeing me. What he says is what I would say. Hitting him is like hitting me.” In such a situation, how would the child turn out? He would become arrogant. If elders do not know how to teach children properly, their love can be detrimental. The difficulty in teaching children today stems from excessive indulgence.

Fortunately, the boy's parents had the opportunity to learn *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*. Realizing the situation, they decided to bring their child back. Once, during mealtime, the boy, finding the selection of dishes insufficient, propped himself against the table with his feet, and declared, “There are too few dishes; I won’t eat!” This is incorrect, but it’s understandable considering how spoiled he was. An emperor would demand a hundred dishes for a meal! So when the dishes were not enough, he refused to eat. After his mother brought him back, one morning she prepared a nutritious porridge for him. He told his mother, "I only want noodles, not porridge." His mother didn't get angry because “deep-rooted habits are not formed in a day.” She knew she needed patience to correct his behavior. So, she responded, “If you don’t want it, fine.” At nine o'clock, when he was hungry again, his mother brought out the porridge again, which he still refused. Many children today are stubborn; what do we do? We must not confront them head-on; we need to be patient and persistent. She put away the porridge again. By nine-thirty, he was so hungry he devoured the porridge, proclaiming, “It’s actually quite good!” He was oblivious to the hardships of the common people.

Subsequently, they sent him to kindergarten. His parents cooperated with the teachers to teach him to bow.  His mother brought him to the school. Upon meeting the teacher, she asked him to bow. The child stood motionless. His mother began bowing to the teacher, saying, "Just like Mommy does." She bowed about ten times, but the child still didn't move. As she had to go to work, she left. Near the community entrance, she realized her mistake. Education requires a careful start; if a child is not taught properly initially, it becomes increasingly difficult later. She immediately called her husband, who rushed over. Together, they approached the child and said, "Now, Daddy will teach you to bow to the teacher." Then the father began bowing continuously. The child, standing there, started to cry.  The father's sincerity melted his hardened heart. The child finally bowed to the teacher. Once he could manage that one bow, subsequent ones became easier. Teaching a child well requires strong cooperation between parents and teachers.

This mother had a keen sense of education. Because the child was over-indulged, he lacked respect for others. So, she worked to curb his arrogance and cultivate respect. Every time they left the community, she would tell the child, "Come, say hello to the uncle, good morning," referring to the security guard. The child always resisted.  One day, his mother, next to the security guard, told her child, “If you don’t bow today, we won’t go further.” The child still wouldn't bow. She said, “Everyone from our national leaders to all those who work contribute to society and deserve our respect. You are so young and dependent on your parents’ care and the service of others. You should thank this uncle and say hello.” She taught her child in front of the security guard. When the child could understand these principles and bow to his elders, it would build an attitude of respect that would benefit him for life.

We can use bowing to greet people. Adults typically use handshakes, a Western custom. Chinese tradition favors bowing, especially when meeting elders.  We should approach and bow promptly, not walk leisurely as if we had all the time in the world, which would be disrespectful. When greeting elders, we bow. When greeting peers, we can bow more casually. In the Korean drama *Sangdo*, we can see people bowing when they meet each other, which feels very comfortable.  Even when meeting someone they dislike, they restrain themselves and bow.

Today, handshakes are common. What etiquette should be observed when shaking hands? For example, who should extend their hand first? We must consider the "order" of things. When an elder and younger person are meeting, the elder should extend their hand first. If they don't, we can simply bow. In a meeting of superiors and subordinates, the superior should extend their hand first. When meeting someone's superior, we should also wait for them to extend their hand. This order should not be reversed, or it can lead to awkward situations. Between men and women, who should extend their hand first? Women should extend their hand first. Otherwise, if a man extends his hand and the woman does not reciprocate, it will be embarrassing.

When shaking hands, we should consider our "attitude". We should make eye contact. For example, at a banquet, if we meet many friends, it's insincere to look at someone else while shaking someone’s hand, saying "Hello, hello" absentmindedly. We should look at them directly.

Besides eye contact, we must also pay attention to the pressure of the handshake. It should not be too strong, which can cause pain. Also, the grip should be firm.  Many people have a weak handshake, like a bad habit, just touching someone’s hand with no sincerity. The "duration" of the handshake should also be appropriate. This is especially true for men meeting attractive women; they must not overstay the handshake. When we pay attention to all these aspects, others will be happy to shake hands with us.  We should aim to make others feel comfortable when shaking hands.

After the handshake, we should introduce each other. Interestingly, the introduction order is the reverse of the handshake order. When introducing, we introduce the junior to the senior, the subordinate to the superior, and the man to the woman. These are the considerations to keep in mind.  Etiquette is really a natural order, as the *Book of Rites - The Record of Music* says: “Rituals are the order of heaven and earth.”  There are natural rules governing all that happens.

During introductions, a person might offer you their business card. Giving and receiving business cards should also be done with care. How should you offer a business card? Use both hands to present the card. And which side should be facing the receiver? The side they can read immediately.  If you give it upside down, they have to turn it to read.  These details show how thoughtful you are.

After receiving a business card, you should look at it. "When addressing elders, do not call them by their given names." This applies not only to elders but also to most people. If a person is a general manager or a department head, address them using their title and family name to show respect, which will make them pleased. Be sure to check their family name and read it properly. It can be awkward if you forget it, then have to look at the card again during the conversation.

Where should you keep the card? You might put it in your bag. However, many people put it directly on the table, where it might get stained with spilled food or drink. This would give the other person a bad impression. When we are mindful of our etiquette, we create a good impression and build bridges of friendship. Therefore, we must not neglect greeting etiquette.

"When meeting an elder, approach quickly and bow. If they do not respond, step back and stand respectfully." After greeting an elder, if they have no further business, we can leave after they depart; this is described by "If they do not respond, step back and stand respectfully". When I was in college, I didn’t have many chances to go home. I would only go home a few times each semester. When we enter the house, seeing our parents, this is called “meeting an elder.” We call out, “Mom, Dad.” Many college students, after seeing their parents, become busier than when they were at school, rushing out to meet their friends.  In reality, parents waited a long time for us to come home and have much to say to us. We often neglect their feelings. This is something we should repent of.

We should greet our parents, put down our luggage, and then stay with them. Because parents have not talked with you for a while, they will be worried about your circumstances.  You should sit with them, read a book, or have a cup of tea. This time cannot be missed. Many people say, “My mother never has anything to say to me.” That’s because you say hi and then leave immediately, before they have time to collect their thoughts.  When you take the time to sit with your parents or elders quietly, their inspiration will come, and they will naturally have many things to talk about with you. Therefore, we must be patient when talking with elders. After spending time together, if your parents have nothing more to say, then you can “step back and stand respectfully”.

In Haikou, a student, having been diligently taught *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* by his teacher, wanted to bow to his parents to thank them for their care that past year when he returned home for the New Year holiday. He prepared two cups of tea and felt his heart beat fast as he prepared to go out. When he was about to step out, some guests arrived, and he retreated, becoming even more embarrassed. But remembering his teacher’s words, he bravely opened the door and went to his parents, suddenly kneeling before them. Everyone, who had been chatting, fell silent at this sudden act, and with implicit consent, they closed their mouths.  The boy said, “I thank my parents for raising me this past year. In the new year, I wish you health and longevity,” and then he respectfully bowed to them three times.  The adults were very moved.  Children can have an influence on adults.  The boy, upon returning to school, wrote an essay about how nervous he was to thank his parents, but when he kneeled down, his mind became clear.  The first step is the hardest, but once we make the first move, we will keep doing better and better.

> “Dismount when riding, get out of the carriage when traveling, and wait even after they pass beyond 100 steps.”

“Dismount when riding, get out of the carriage when traveling, and wait even after they pass beyond 100 steps” describes ancient modes of transportation, riding a horse and traveling by carriage.  When we encounter elders while riding a horse, we should dismount; if we are in a carriage, we should get out to show respect. This principle can be extended: if you are busy working on a computer and an elder comes, you should stop your work and greet the elder. This is showing consistent respect.

However, what if you're driving at high speed, and suddenly see your uncle in another car? Should you roll down the window and shout, “Uncle!”? This would be a safety risk. Therefore, we must learn etiquette with flexibility.

“Wait even after they pass beyond 100 steps" can be extended to the etiquette of seeing guests off.  We must wait until the elder or guest leaves before we do.  Once, I had students practice seeing guests off. One was the host, and one was the guest. They walked to the door, said “Goodbye,” and the host would slam the door closed immediately. I then asked the guest, “How do you feel when someone sees you off like that?” The guest said, "It feels like they can’t wait for me to leave!” So, when we see guests off, we should make them feel respected.

Besides this practical exercise, we should also have a discussion with the students so they understand the proper way to see a guest off. Many students suggested seeing the guest to the elevator, waiting until the guest goes down, and then returning.  This would be warmer.  If there isn't an elevator, we see them to the stairway and then return.

In the past, when seeing off an elder or a teacher, people truly waited “even after they pass beyond 100 steps." They wouldn’t leave until the teacher was out of sight. When I studied in Australia, I put what I learned to use. In the evenings after classes, we would see our teacher back to his residence. I always stood there until he went into his room. Other students wondered why I waited. I explained, "It's because of ‘wait even after they pass beyond 100 steps." As I practiced this, my heart was full of joy. During that time, I reflected on my life and knew that without my teacher, my wisdom would not have awakened, and my afflictions would never end. It was due to my teacher's teachings that I had grown so much. So the act of seeing off my teacher was filled with gratitude, cherishing this teacher-student relationship. The way people interacted in the past was filled with loyalty and affection, which led them to write many poignant poems.

Li Bai's poem "Farewell to Meng Haoran at Yellow Crane Tower, Going to Guangling" mentions, “My old friend departs from the Yellow Crane Tower to the west; amidst the spring of March, he sails down the river to Yang Zhou. His lonely sail disappears into the distant blue sky. Only the Yangtze River flows to the horizon.” "His lonely sail disappears into the distant blue sky" shows that Li Bai waited until his friend was completely out of sight before leaving. This reveals his deep friendship and appreciation. Can today’s children write a poem like that? It’s hard! They lack respect, and tend to be agitated and impatient. By teaching these rituals, we can cultivate respect in children.

My sworn brother came from Taichung to hear my lecture. After listening to two classes, he had to leave. He said he would feel uneasy not attending, which showed his great support for me. Later, I walked him a distance to the train station and stayed until he left, practicing "wait even after they pass beyond 100 steps." I suddenly thought about how he had supported me for the past ten years and how, even though I had failed many times, he still trusted me. He told me, "As long as you hold onto your original intentions, helping people and society, you will accomplish great things for the benefit of others." He constantly cares for me, and was happy and gratified to see my involvement in education these past years.

**6. When With Elders: When They are Standing, Juniors Should Not Sit Unbidden**

>  "When elders stand, juniors do not sit. When elders sit, only then when invited, should you sit."

"When elders stand, juniors do not sit. When elders sit, only then when invited, should you sit" is about the etiquette of when to sit. Learning etiquette requires flexibility, not rigidity. For example, when you should bow to greet someone, if you happen to be in a crowded elevator and suddenly see an elder, should you try to bow? You might bump into other people. Also, should we bow in the restroom? Of course not; we can greet the person later. So, learning etiquette requires flexibility, to adjust to the situation and to be appropriate for the circumstance.

One of our teachers learned “When elders sit, only then when invited, should you sit” and went to a business and met with the person in charge, who was a woman. She ended up standing for a long time. This woman eventually sat down because she was an elder, and the teacher should have sat only after being asked. However, the elder did not say anything, so the teacher continued to stand. She had to tilt her head to speak to him because he was so tall. She said, “Please sit down! My neck is getting sore.” We should recognize when others have to tilt their heads to look at us. Then, without having to be told to, we should naturally sit down. We must not be rigid in our understanding of etiquette.

One day, a two or three-year-old girl was out playing with her parents and grandmother.  In a park, her father was sitting and reading the newspaper, and the little girl was sitting on a bench. When her grandmother came over, the little girl jumped up. The bench was high, and she lost her balance and fell. Her father and grandmother were surprised and rushed to help her. They asked, "Why did you jump up?"  The little girl said, "When elders stand, juniors do not sit.” Because her grandmother approached, she immediately stood up. The father was ashamed that he hadn’t reacted, sitting there reading the newspaper, while his two-year-old daughter had already jumped up.

**7.  When Speaking to Elders and Teachers, the Tone of Voice Should Be Soft and Moderate**

> "When before an elder, your voice should be lowered. But if you cannot be heard, that is also not correct."

“When before an elder, your voice should be lowered. But if you cannot be heard, that is also not correct” concerns the politeness of our speech. We should lower our voice in front of elders, so as not to disturb their conversation. Children today often fail to grasp the proper way to speak.  Often, when a group of children get together, they lose control, shouting loudly, creating chaos.  Elders should stop them when this happens, otherwise, it will be harder to correct this bad habit later.  When we find that children are talking too loudly and disturbing elders, we should quickly tell them, "You need to be quieter." Some elders say, "Be quieter!" and the children will lower their voices, but how long? Maybe three minutes, then they lose control again. They say "Be quieter!" again, but there is no effect.  Elders say, “Forget it, just ignore them.” This is incorrect! Education requires patience.

Chinese culture emphasizes the Middle Way, which is expressed in daily life. For example, if we wear too many clothes, we feel hot, while if we wear too few, we will catch a cold; if we eat too much, we get a stomachache, and if we eat too little, we are hungry. Should we apply the Middle Way to speaking? Yes! Therefore, "When before an elder, your voice should be lowered."


Okay, here's a professional-level translation of the provided text, with attention to accuracy, fluency, and cultural nuance:

**Book Translation: Regarding Proper Conduct and Respect**

**7. Speaking Clearly to Elders**

Speaking to elders in too low a voice is impolite and makes it difficult for them to hear. Therefore, "low and inaudible" is not suitable. When speaking with elders, we should ensure they clearly understand what we are saying. Additionally, we should make eye contact while speaking, looking at the elders directly. This is the meaning of “when asked, respond directly; when speaking, look steadily.” When we talk to children nowadays, they may not even be able to maintain eye contact for more than ten seconds. When children do not focus their eyes while speaking to others, it shows a lack of respect and a restless heart. Why are children so restless now? It’s because they lack education in proper etiquette, and over time, they become self-centered. Therefore, we, as elders, must patiently teach them these small details, gradually guiding them to follow rules and be considerate of others in all situations.

**8. When Called by Elders, Respond Promptly; Slowness is Impolite**

*Approach with haste, withdraw with delay; When asked, respond directly; when speaking, look steadily.*

"Approach with haste, withdraw with delay." When encountering elders, we should approach them quickly, not making them wait too long. When we finish speaking with elders and are about to leave, we should take a few steps back slowly before walking away. When an elder finishes speaking to you, don't immediately say "Okay, goodbye" and rush off. This conveys to the elder that you can’t wait to leave and don't want to stay another second. Therefore, in all situations, we must be mindful of others’ feelings, hence, “withdraw with delay.”

"When asked, respond directly; when speaking, look steadily." When elders are conversing with us, our gaze should be focused on them. We should listen attentively to what they are saying. This attitude must be trained. We see many children today who cannot settle their minds. When you speak to them, their attention wanders after just a few sentences. You need to be firm and insist that they look at you and listen until you finish speaking. After you’ve finished, you should ask them, "What did Dad just say?" or "What did the teacher just say?" and have them repeat it back to you. This will train them both to listen attentively and to be respectful.

**9. Respect Teachers, Cherish Classmates, and Live Harmoniously with All in Society**

*Serve uncles as you would your own father, serve older brothers as you would your own.*

"Serve uncles as you would your own father, serve older brothers as you would your own." "Uncles" refers to the generation of uncles, such as paternal and maternal uncles. "Older brothers" refers to older male and female cousins. Let us reflect: these uncles have accompanied and cared for us as we grew up. They have held us countless times and blessed us with healthy growth. They all care deeply for us. As the saying goes, "A drop of kindness should be repaid with a fountain of gratitude." Having this kind of attitude makes life generous and full of joy.

During this lecture, I see many elders and friends that I have met over the past few years, some of whom I haven’t seen for one or two years. Seeing each other now, these elders and friends are all delighted, and they wish me to have made some progress during this time. When I receive these sincere blessings, I hold them in my heart, knowing that "a drop of kindness should be repaid with a fountain of gratitude." I should strive to better myself and contribute to society, bringing happiness to those who have blessed me. Similarly, our uncles and older cousins have grown up alongside us and given us much support and care, a debt we must also keep in our hearts. When they are in need, we should do our best to help.

In addition to those who are related to us by blood, we can also interpret the idea of "uncles" more broadly. "All" can refer to the public, meaning we should have a respectful heart when serving the parents of anyone, and we should have love and care when treating the siblings of anyone. When we understand things in this way, our hearts become much more open, and greater capacity brings greater blessings.

Ms. Xu Zhe, a national treasure of Singapore, has dedicated decades of her life to caring for the sick and the poor. When a reporter asked, “You’ve helped so many people…,” she interrupted before the question could be finished, saying, “How have I helped others? I’m helping my own siblings.” In her view, the entire universe is her home. The reporter then asked, "You take care of others; who takes care of you?" The elder replied happily, "I don't need to take care of myself. Heaven will take care of me." What a magnanimous attitude towards life! It is perfectly in line with the wisdom of the sages.

Lao Tzu said, “Heaven does not show favoritism; it always favors the good.” The blessings of a good person are immeasurable. Ms. Xu Zhe said that her refrigerator would mysteriously fill with food, and she didn't know who had brought it. Why didn't she know? Because the givers sought no reward or return. If we give gifts with a purpose, telling the recipient, “This is from me,” then it becomes a burden upon receiving, as though they owe us a favor. This can create pressure in relationships. Ms. Xu Zhe's giving is selfless; she feels she is doing what she should. This moves people deeply, so when they have an opportunity to help her, they do so proactively and might bring food to place in her refrigerator.

When Teacher Yang teaches children to recite classics and practice calligraphy, every time class ends, and the students have left, she will walk into the kitchen to find packages of vegetables and fruit, not knowing who has delivered them. Therefore, we can genuinely interact with everyone. When you treat everyone in the world like siblings, they will treat you as siblings in return. Therefore, "all within the four seas are brothers" is a result. How do we plant the seed? We treat everyone in the world like family, and we proactively give. This way, we will attain such a result.

The *Classic of Filial Piety* says, "When you respect his father, his son rejoices. When you respect his elder brother, his younger brother rejoices. When you respect his ruler, his minister rejoices. Respect one person, and a thousand will rejoice." In fact, interpersonal relationships are not complex. As long as you possess a genuine heart, you will surely win good favor from others. When we show respect to the fathers of others, their children will be happy, and you will surely get along well with their families. "When you respect his elder brother," his younger siblings will all be happy. "When you respect his ruler," you will be respected by his superiors, his company, and his colleagues. Therefore, when we constantly hold this respect in our hearts, we will naturally earn the friendship of others.

In addition to respecting fathers and brothers, we must further extend this to “loving the crow on its roof” (loving someone and therefore loving everything associated with them). We should respect “uncles” and “older brothers,” which would include also caring for the children of our brothers, or the children of our uncles. During the Ming Dynasty, there was a woman named Zhang Jiaying. She was an orphan from a young age. She had three older brothers, who unfortunately passed away early, so she took care of her nephews alongside their mothers, her sisters-in-law. Sadly, all three of her sisters-in-law also passed away one after another. In these circumstances, Zhang Jiaying dedicated herself to raising the younger generation. When she has this attitude, that is the true meaning of "serve uncles as you would your own father, serve older brothers as you would your own." Her love for them would certainly bring comfort to her brothers and to her parents. She never married, dedicating her life to lovingly raising her nephews and nieces. In her later years, she was well-provided for by those she had raised.

During my teaching, I have also encountered students whose parents had passed away and were raised by their aunts. When these aunts were seeing someone, they would tell the other person, “I must bring my two nephews with me when I marry.” I felt immense respect when speaking with these women, and often I felt like I was going to cry, feeling the full strength of their loyalty and righteousness. When every elder can care for the younger generation in this way, I believe that families, even if not perfect, can still develop well. This points to “loving the crow on its roof”: we must respect elders and be kind to the young.

During the Jin Dynasty, there was a scholar named Zu Ti. At the time, the Jin Dynasty was unstable, as the northern tribes were causing unrest, and he had to lead several hundred families, including his relatives and neighbors, to the Huai and Si region. He had been very chivalrous from a young age and was skilled at caring for others. Along the way, he gave all the carts and horses to the elderly and walked himself. He also gave all of his family's wealth and medicine to others. He took care of everyone in this way. The Emperor Yuan of Jin admired his virtue and gave him a position, which he executed well. Zu Ti was always determined to take back the land that the nation had lost and had great ambition. Indeed, during his lifetime, he recovered much of the Jin Dynasty's lost territory.

During this time of refuge, Zu Ti was always considerate of everyone's needs, teaching them how to cultivate land and what to expect from harvests. When they encountered bones (as the war had left many bodies), Zu Ti organized people to bury the remains and arranged memorial ceremonies. These actions moved the common people greatly. Once when they were eating together, many elders said, “We are old, but meeting Zu Ti is like having our own parents born again. We will have no regrets when we die.” The benevolence of Zu Ti moved countless people, and when he passed away, the people felt as if they had lost their own parents. Zu Ti truly embodied “serve uncles as you would your own father, serve older brothers as you would your own.”

While studying in Australia, I was present when an elder had a stomach hemorrhage and was vomiting a lot of blood. I happened to encounter him as he was walking through our college. I saw how pale his face was, and I immediately notified the local staff, and he was rushed to the hospital. Luckily, his condition was not serious, and he only needed time to rest, so he needed someone to take care of him. I volunteered, saying, "Let me take care of him. I want to experience what it’s like to take care of my parents." I had lived with my parents for a while, and many friends would say, “You're so filial, living with your parents.” I felt ashamed, because my parents were healthier than I was, and although it looked like I was taking care of them, it was often the other way around. I cherished this opportunity in Australia. An elder was sick, and I could practice “tasting the medicine first if a relative is ill” and “checking on them every morning and night” and watching for his needs at every moment. I was very happy, and even though I was missing class (there were many courses), I could truly apply what I had learned by taking care of this elder.

Because his stomach was injured, he could not eat difficult-to-digest foods. He had to start eating baby cereal, about every two hours. I began to learn how to take care of an elder, cooking a bowl of cereal for him every two hours. During this period, I improved my level of attention to detail. The elder was also very happy that I was there with him as he recovered. I also learned many principles of interacting with others from this elder. Though he was a manual laborer, working at times even in deep sewers, he had led workers from many countries. He would always lead by example. When workers were short on money, he would generously assist them, never asking for anything in return.

In this process, I came to know a person of benevolence. Though he was a manual laborer, he loved Chinese culture and wrote exquisite seal script calligraphy. There are many hidden talents around us, if we only take the time to discover them. Thus we must treat everyone with respect. If we maintain this respect, we will surely encounter mentors who will be of great assistance to us, and we can come to know the great benefit that “to be near the benevolent is infinitely good, virtue improves daily and faults reduce”.

Because we lived together and took care of each other, when I had to leave before them, I deeply felt their sorrow at my departure. There is true emotion between not just men and women, but also between men. The most important thing is to treat each other sincerely.

**III. Mindfulness**

**1. Rise Early to Value Time and Treasure the Moment**

*Rise early, sleep late; Old age arrives quickly; Treasure this time.*

“Rise early, sleep late” means to get up a little earlier in the morning and go to sleep a little later at night. Many parents now believe that this will affect their children's health. Indeed, sleeping is sometimes more important than eating, because while sleeping, the whole body is resting, and many bodily functions are recovering. Thus, children typically require more sleep. But, for someone who has high ambitions and a fulfilling life, the time they sleep may naturally decrease.

We often say that Teacher Yang Shufen practices "early to bed, early to rise." What does that mean? She goes to sleep at two or three in the morning and gets up at six or seven in the morning, thus “early to bed, early to rise.” She sleeps four hours a day and is still rosy-cheeked and full of vitality, something we younger people envy. In China, a very skilled traditional Chinese medicine doctor took her pulse and said, “You sleep so little yet are so full of energy. It’s because you’re absorbing the energy of heaven and earth.” What is the energy of heaven and earth? It’s a vast, righteous energy. When our minds are always aligned with the intentions of the ancient sages, our physical and mental state will get better and better. If you want to imitate Teacher Yang and sleep four hours, you will probably lose a lot of weight within a week. Why? Because you haven’t reached Teacher Yang’s level of cultivation. This is a matter of being hasty and achieving the opposite.

Getting up early and going to bed a little later gives us more time each day to study and work diligently. In ancient times, filial children would rise very early to do housework. As it says in *Zhu Zi’s Maxims for Managing a Household*, “At daybreak, rise up to sweep and clean the yard; the interior and exterior must be neat and tidy.” It also states, "At dusk, retire to bed; check the doors and windows to ensure they are locked.” This means that when resting in the evening, filial children must personally check whether doors and windows are properly closed. Why did the ancient people, even in their teens, have such extraordinary working abilities? Why could they even become county magistrates? It's because from a young age, they had gone through a lot of experience and had studied the classics of the sages.

"Old age arrives quickly; Treasure this time" is a warning that our lives are very short. From the moment we are born, there is only one thing we are making valiant progress towards: death. Death is inevitable. Therefore, in this brief span of time, we should make our lives valuable, and let them shine brightly. Thus, ancient sages taught extensively about cherishing time. Wen Jia, a painter from the Ming Dynasty, cautioned later generations, “Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are? To wait daily for tomorrow, all endeavors will be squandered.” This means, “If we put off until tomorrow all that we should do today, we will have endless tomorrows, and our entire lives will amount to nothing.” Yan Zhenqing of the Tang Dynasty wrote, “At the third watch the lamp is lit, at the fifth watch the rooster crows; these are the times for scholars to learn. When hair is black, they don’t know the need to study. When hair is white, they regret the lateness of studying.” As it is said, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold," even if you have vast wealth, you cannot possibly buy back time that has passed. If a child approaches time with reverence and care, it will be difficult for him to squander it. A Han Dynasty ballad says, “Hundreds of rivers flow east to the sea, when will they return west again? When young and strong, if you do not strive, when old you can only weep in vain.” We hope that our children will not have regrets in life, so we must instill in them the value of time from a young age. They should also have regular daily routines. When on vacation, we shouldn’t ignore their routines, allowing them to play until the middle of the night and sleep until noon the next day. This is not good.

When we teach children to recite classics, we place great emphasis on the time spent learning. They get up at 6:30 and must recite the *Standards for Students* by 7:00. These children are only six or seven years old and learn and then put into practice what they learn. For example, one little girl stayed up a little later on New Year’s Eve, and her mother set the alarm clock an hour later to give her more time to sleep. However, she had already established a routine. She woke up at around 6:00 and realized that it was still only 5:00. She tried to go back to sleep, but she became more and more uncomfortable, feeling like time was dragging on. Finally, she looked and saw that it was 7:00. She went outside and saw that it was actually 8:00! She immediately burst into tears, saying, “It’s 8:00! I didn't recite the *Standards for Students*!” Why was this child crying? She takes her studies seriously, and she respects her teacher. She is unwilling to disobey what her teacher has instructed. Therefore, parents must cooperate with teachers and avoid trying to help but doing harm. It’s okay if the child sleeps for half an hour less; what matters is that she doesn’t lose her respect for the teacher.

"An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold can’t buy an inch of time.” While we say these things, do we truly feel it? If we ask a teenager, will they understand this sentiment? It’s very difficult. Scholars of ancient times, who have left their names in history, all treasured their time greatly. For instance, Sima Guang spent 19 years to finish his massive historical work, *Zizhi Tongjian*. He was afraid of sleeping too much, so he used wood to make a round pillow. A round pillow can easily roll off the side of your head, so whenever he woke up, he would immediately get back to work. He had this kind of dedicated spirit, which enabled him to complete his great work. What was it that motivated him so strongly to prefer to sleep less in order to do more work? He was motivated by the drive to benefit the nation, its people, and future generations. History is like a mirror. As long as we are willing to study *Zizhi Tongjian*, we can avoid many unnecessary mistakes. By studying the past, we can know the future. He had this sense of mission, which spurred him on to write his book with diligence and precision.

Mr. Wang Yangming once said that a person without a goal cannot achieve anything. To treasure time, one must first set goals for one's life. Life is brief, so we should use this short time to live up to the nurturing kindness of our parents, the care of our siblings, the support of the many elders who have helped us in our growth, and the care the nation has provided us. Therefore, when a person never forgets these debts of gratitude, they will dedicate themselves to being filial to their parents, loving their siblings, and further contributing to society. A person who understands the value of time will respect their parents, respect those who care for them, and will not waste their lives, nor cause those who love them pain. Thus, when they know how to fulfill their role and mission, no one needs to push them; they will move forward with haste.

We often hear people in their 40s say that if they could relive their lives, they wouldn't do this or that. Life cannot be relived. Regret comes too late. Confucius said, "If one hears the Way in the morning, one can die in the evening." This means that as long as we have the opportunity to hear the teachings of the sages or to hear the Buddhist Dharma in this life, we must cherish this opportunity. No matter how old you are, as long as you seize the opportunity to hear about the practice of chanting Buddha's name for rebirth, in this life you can attain immeasurable light and longevity. This is an extremely rare and opportune time, and we must advance with great courage. With this attitude, our spiritual practice will not be wasted.

We must understand the good intentions of the ancient sages, in all of their advice, and we must not waste time. Why do people waste time? The generation of my father lived very fulfilling lives. They studied very diligently, while our generation did not study as diligently as they did. This is because they had ambition. They wanted to grow up quickly, work hard, and support their parents. My third uncle has a Ph.D. He said when he was working in the fields, whenever he would lift his head and see vehicles in the distance, he would think that he must develop himself so that his parents would no longer need to suffer. People with ambition will lead fulfilling lives. If we lack ambition, we are just complacent, and life passes by. The common saying of today's children is, “I'm so bored!” Their days are filled with eating, drinking, and playing. They don’t know how to set goals. If things continue in this way, the blessings of this generation of youth will soon be depleted, and their middle and old age will be miserable.

General Zeng Guofan once said that one can look at three things to determine whether a family is prospering or declining. First, what time do their descendants get up? If they sleep until the sun is high in the sky, the family’s values will certainly decline. This is because those who are greedy for sleep will be lax and lazy. If children are lax and lazy, they will not work diligently, and they will not cherish the efforts of others. If they do not cherish the efforts of others, they will not be grateful.

Okay, here's a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and a tone that reflects the original's instructive nature:

**Book Translation**

Many habits are interconnected and have a ripple effect. Second, observe whether his descendants help with household chores and are diligent. Third, observe whether his descendants are reading classic texts. As the *Zhu Zi Family Maxims* states, “Even if descendants are foolish, they must not fail to read the classics.” Because if they don’t read the classics, they won’t understand principles. Without understanding principles, they cannot clearly discern right from wrong, good from evil.

When a person truly grasps the fundamental principles of self-cultivation and conduct, when they understand the value of life, they find time especially precious and insufficient. They wish for more time to fulfill their filial duties, more time to contribute to family and society, and even wish they could be ten people! Therefore, it’s essential to cultivate in children an attitude of cherishing time from a young age.

There’s a very insightful story about parents teaching their children to value time. A father noticed his child idling his days away, but he didn’t immediately stop him. One day, the father took a stick eighty centimeters long and said to his child, “Son, a person’s life spans several decades, like this stick. This stick is eighty centimeters long, representing you living to eighty years old. For the first twenty years, we are unable to contribute to the family or society; instead, our parents must raise and teach us.” He then picked up an axe and chopped off twenty centimeters of the stick. The child was shocked. Then, the father said, “After sixty years old, our bodies weaken, and we must rely on others to care for us. So those twenty years are also not productive.” He chopped off another twenty centimeters of the stick. The child was shocked again. Then, the father said, “A person spends a third of each day sleeping, so a third of what remains must be cut off.” After saying this, he chopped off another thirteen centimeters. Now, only twenty-seven centimeters of the stick remained, and the child began to panic. The father continued, “Every day, you still have to eat three meals, bathe, and there are still a lot of miscellaneous tasks.” Just as the father was about to chop off another piece, the son said in shame, “Father, don't chop anymore; I understand.” The father looked at him and said, “You don’t understand. Consider how many illnesses you will suffer in your life; those hours must be deducted as well.” And he chopped off another piece. The child was enlightened and knelt down. The father then said to him, “You see, life is so short, yet you still need to improve your knowledge, take care of your parents, and contribute to society by doing meaningful things. With so much to do in so little time, how can you waste it and squander it?”

Therefore, when we consistently demonstrate an attitude of cherishing time, we set a great example for our children. I rarely saw my father idle; whenever he had free time, he would open a book. Indeed, parents' actions profoundly influence their children. When parents cherish time, their children will feel uneasy when wasting it. So, when elders treat time with respect, their children naturally do the same because they are influenced by their elders' consistent example.

There was a mother whose first-grade child was always dawdling in the morning. His mother knew he would be late, but she didn’t stop him. Was this the right approach? Yes, she let him experience the consequences of his procrastination. So she didn't stop him and watched to see how long he would take. Sure enough, he was late for school. When the son came home for lunch, the mother saw that he was happily skipping and smiling. She thought, "The teacher must not have punished him. How could he not show any shame?" So, the mother took the initiative to call the teacher and said, "Teacher, my son was late today." The teacher said, "I know; it's okay." The mother said, "How can it be okay? It's very important! If a child is late, if we don't correct him immediately, he will form a bad habit." The teacher said, "I thought you were calling to explain why he was late." From the teacher’s reaction, we can see who is covering up for children’s mistakes these days? This harms them. The mother also told the teacher, "Teacher, you must criticize and punish him properly this afternoon." The teacher laughed and said, "It’s rare to see a parent requesting criticism and discipline these days. Very well, I will definitely discipline him properly this afternoon.”

That afternoon, the little boy came home with a sad face. As soon as he entered the house, he immediately went to get his alarm clock and set it for 6:30 AM. Only then did he feel more at ease. The mother saw this and went to him, saying, "If you set it for 6:30 AM now, it will go off during dinner. You should adjust it after dinner so it will ring tomorrow since the alarm clock works on a twelve-hour cycle; there are two 6:30 AMs in a day." The child hadn't realized there are twenty-four hours in a day, with two 6:30 AMs. After his mother explained, he suddenly understood that he should adjust it after dinner. The mother didn't scold him but seized this opportunity to educate him. And no matter where he went, he carried his small alarm clock and often woke up on his own at the appointed time. Therefore, it is important to be careful from the beginning in educating children. If you can correct a child the first time they make a mistake, they will benefit for their entire life.

**2. Actively Brush Teeth and Wash Face in the Morning; Maintain Personal Hygiene**

*“Morning must wash, also rinse mouth, after bathroom return, always wash hands.”* This describes the habit of cleanliness. Cleanliness is the foundation of good health. We must be clean to avoid viruses or bacteria harming our bodies. Truly cherishing your body is also practicing filial piety: “Our bodies, hair, and skin are received from our parents; we dare not damage them. This is the beginning of filial piety.” The *Rules for Students* says, “If the body is injured, parents will worry.” Therefore, "caution" – while the text might seem to be about personal matters, in reality, we are inextricably linked to others. When our health suffers, our loved ones will surely worry for us.

Confucius taught in the *Analects*, “Parents worry only for their children’s illnesses.” "Illness," in the narrow sense means being sick, but it can also be interpreted as bad habits or negative behavior. Therefore, being clean protects the body from illness and injury. A regular routine is also crucial for health. When you are cautious in your actions, you are less likely to make mistakes, allowing your parents to be at peace and worry-free.  Interpreting the word “illness” broadly means that both in terms of physical health and in our conduct, we shouldn't make mistakes that would worry our parents. A person who cares for their body and is clean is also showing respect for others. As the saying goes, "Respect yourself, and others will respect you.” When you emphasize cleanliness and are dressed neatly, people will naturally have a higher regard for you. When you are disheveled and dirty, others will look down on you before even interacting with you. When people look down on you, don't blame them right away. Instead, reflect on yourself to see if you are lacking in etiquette.

"Morning must wash, also rinse mouth," keeps your breath fresh. Because people have so many conversations every day, this is essential. If a child doesn’t brush their teeth, their breath will be unpleasant, and their social relationships at school will be greatly affected. When a child has poor social relationships from a young age, it harms their self-confidence. We once had a student who was so dirty that all the other students ostracized him. So, the formation of this habit is indeed influenced by the family. Additionally, bad breath can also affect relationships. Bad breath indicates that there are too many toxins in the body being released. Why do people have so many toxins? It is related to what they eat; as the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." It is also closely related to eating late-night meals.

*"Morning must wash, also rinse mouth, after bathroom return, always wash hands."* While these seem to be rules for personal conduct, they also naturally influence others. “Morning must wash, also rinse mouth” shows respect for one’s own body, as well as respect for parents, since your body is an extension of them. When you are clean and tidy, people enjoy interacting with you. If you are dirty and don't wash your hands after using the restroom, people will avoid you, and it will cause them annoyance. Therefore, by demanding cleanliness and order of oneself, you also influence others; the self and others are not separate.  So “caution” seems to be for ourselves but is actually for the sake of others, to avoid causing discomfort and trouble. Rinsing your mouth is also about caring for your teeth. If teeth are not properly cared for, they will cause a lot of pain, and you will have to spend money on treatment, which is wasteful.

Modern people often have bad breath. Why? Of course, it is related to what they eat. Many friends who hike will get very winded, especially those who eat meat; their breath is particularly heavy. Nowadays, people often eat late-night meals. Eating at night easily leads to bad breath. When a person consumes meat in the middle of the night, they will go to sleep an hour or two later. When you sleep, only two organs remain active: the lungs and the heart, while the stomach stops functioning. Everything eaten remains in the stomach. Think about how long a piece of meat takes to smell bad on your hand, usually two to three hours, even at room temperature. When food enters the stomach, it is in a hot and acidic environment, making it smell even worse. These toxins circulate throughout the body. Therefore, many people who eat late-night meals don’t sleep well because there are too many toxins in their bodies. When the toxins are released, their breath is particularly bad. So, you should eat less in the evening. People’s three meals should be a good breakfast, a full lunch, and a light dinner, allowing the stomach more time to rest, which is good for the body. In addition to preventing bad breath, one should also pay attention to etiquette when yawning or sneezing. When you sneeze, you should immediately cover your mouth and nose, otherwise it is very impolite. Similarly, it’s best to cover your mouth when you yawn, which is more refined.

"After bathroom return, always wash hands." After using the restroom, you must wash your hands. Similarly, when your hands are dirty, you should take the initiative to wash them. For instance, if we’ve just come home from work, we may want to immediately hug our children, but the bacteria on our hands can affect their health. So, the first thing to do when we enter the door should be to wash our hands, which is beneficial for our own health and that of our family. Because eating is related to our hands, if there are bacteria on our hands, it is easy to cause harm to our bodies. Aside from washing your hands after using the restroom, you must also wash them before meals. Observing things closely and explaining them in detail to children will make them more alert. It’s common to see adults counting money, licking their fingers to turn the pages, and ingesting all the bacteria into their stomachs. This sets a bad example for children. Therefore, we must pay attention to establishing clean living habits in order to stay healthy and to be a good role model for our children.

**3. Dress Neatly, Cleanly, and Appropriately; Be Dignified**

*“Hat must be straight, buttons must be fastened, socks and shoes, all secure and tight.”* This emphasizes being respectful of the clothes we wear. Respecting our clothes is also respecting others. If our clothing is casual and sloppy, it will give a bad first impression and may even cause others to look down on us. Therefore, we must have self-respect so that others will respect us. In ancient times, scholars followed “three straights”: their hat should be worn straight, their belt should be tied straight, and their shoelaces should be tied tight and straight. Therefore, we must look in the mirror before going out to ensure that our face and clothing are neat and tidy so we don't embarrass ourselves.

During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a minister in the state of Jin named Zhao Xuanzi. He saw that Duke Ling of Jin was foolish and tyrannical, so he often tried to advise the duke. The Duke Ling became impatient with Zhao Xuanzi's advice and hired an assassin to kill him. This assassin, named Chu Ni, came to Zhao Xuanzi's door and saw that Zhao Xuanzi, although he had not yet gone to court, was already dressed neatly, taking a short rest. Because Zhao Xuanzi was so respectful, Chu Ni was deeply moved and developed reverence for him. He thought, "A person who is so careful and humble in even such small details must be the pillar and master of the state. If I kill him, I would be letting the state down. But I have already agreed to the ruler’s command. If I don't kill Zhao Xuanzi, I would be breaking my promise to the ruler." So, Chu Ni immediately committed suicide by crashing into a locust tree. Zhao Xuanzi escaped this calamity because he practiced "Hat must be straight, buttons must be fastened," his clothes neat and tidy, earning Chu Ni’s respect. So, never underestimate the importance of having tidy attire. It significantly impacts one's image and even one's destiny.

Clothing affects a person's inner psychology. When we dress neatly, our conduct will naturally become respectful. Clothing should be appropriate for the occasion because it affects our mood and psychological state. In the United States, there was a sales expert named Joe Girard, who specialized in selling cars. One morning, he jumped out of bed, put on a suit and tie, and dressed impeccably, because he was scheduled to call a client. Even though the client couldn't see him, he was very respectful on the phone. After finishing the call, he took off his suit and tie, and immediately jumped back into bed. His wife stared at him with wide eyes and said, "Are you crazy? You got all dressed up in a suit and tie just to make one phone call?" Joe Girard told his wife, "When I am dressed so formally, my heart feels very respectful toward the client. He can surely feel my reverence for him through the phone, and this affects our relationship." Indeed, clothing affects our inner attitude.

Many college graduates have trouble finding jobs after numerous interviews. One college graduate asked Teacher Yang how to apply for jobs. Teacher Yang noticed that these students were dressed casually when they went to interviews. Would they get hired like that? Impossible! Respect yourself, and others will respect you. So, Teacher Yang told them to dress appropriately and try again. Indeed, when they paid attention to their appearance, their entire image changed, and they were soon able to find jobs. Therefore, we must teach our children to understand from a young age that they should dress properly and respectfully.

A person's dignified appearance is very important. When you pay attention to your appearance, others will respect you. If your appearance is unusual, you will not only be looked down upon but may also create a negative trend in society. So, the clothing of public figures is especially important. If they dress revealingly, it could lead to a bad trend in society. Therefore, public figures must carefully consider their impact on the whole society and be careful about their actions.  Parents’ clothing also serves as a model for children to emulate. If a mother's clothing is too revealing, the child will be influenced by what she sees and hear, and might dress revealingly herself in the future. This is not good for the child; it might cause people to treat her lightly and may even put her in danger. Therefore, dressing properly is crucial.

**4. Put Clothes and Belongings in a Fixed Place; Do Not Be Careless**

*“Put hats and clothes, have a fixed place, do not randomly toss, causing dirt and mess.”* These two lines teach us that clothes and hats should be placed in a designated location. If they are scattered everywhere, they will get dirty. If they're scattered everywhere, they'll be impossible to find when needed in an emergency, which will lead to anger towards family members. This is a big problem with many kids today. Without a proper upbringing, children can really cause so much trouble. So, never underestimate the importance of this saying. When children put away their hats and clothes, are they only putting away those two things? When children are used to cleanliness and have this kind of intention, they will naturally straighten chairs that are not in place. So, they will definitely keep their room tidy. When children keep their room tidy, they will be organized, and their hearts will be settled. When their minds are settled, they can open their wisdom. If a child’s room is messy, and they have to search for a long time for anything, no matter how many scriptures you ask them to read, they will not gain wisdom. Knowledge is not found in the scriptures but in the small details of daily life. The classics must be applied to daily life to gain the benefits of learning, and learning must be elevated in daily life. Therefore, when children practice this saying and understand that clothes, hats, backpacks, and even everything else has a fixed place, they will lay the foundation for their lifelong ability to manage people and things.

Don't misunderstand and think getting a degree in Business Administration is the same as actual management knowledge. If a college student’s room is messy and disorganized after four years of studying business administration, would you hire him? That's just theory on paper. Management knowledge must come from being organized, leading by example – that is true management. If a child cannot keep their own room tidy and lacks self-discipline, reading management books for another ten years will be useless. Knowledge requires substance, not mere form. Focusing on form won’t bring any benefits and may even invite ridicule. It's better not to study management than to study it but be unable to manage yourself, which would make you a laughing stock. So, every saying in *Rules for Students* influences a child’s entire life. It’s especially important to understand cause and effect.

Putting all of your belongings in order may seem like you are only doing it for yourself, but in reality, it is also for others. Because you do not live alone, when you develop this good habit, your family members will not be affected by your things being scattered everywhere. When you go to college and live with a roommate, this habit will also prevent you from causing trouble for them. So, when children cultivate good habits, it is also a form of respecting others. Self and others are truly mutually influential; self and others are not separate.

Do not create a messy living environment. This is essential for developing children's independence. We see today’s children; not only can they not care for others, they can't even take care of themselves. Some college students go home and give their parents a bag of dirty laundry as a "gift." There's even a trend of students just throwing their dirty clothes and bedsheets in the garbage at the end of the semester. This is very wasteful. If a child develops such a wasteful habit, they will likely fail in life. So, we must teach children to wash their own clothes and dishes from a young age. Actually, when children do these chores, they feel happy because they feel they are learning to do things, their abilities are improving, and they have a sense of accomplishment.

There was a child who never helped with chores at home. One time, it was his turn to do the dishes, and after looking at all the dishes, he just walked away. What should the teacher do? The teacher also didn't intervene. When mealtime came, the food was ready, but the dishes were not washed. The teacher just sat there, waiting for him to wash the dishes. The child had no choice but to quickly wash the dishes. Then the teacher said to him, "We live in a group, and each person has their own responsibility. If you don't wash the dishes, then there won’t be any dishes to use. If the teacher doesn't cook, you won't have food to eat. Therefore, you should do your best to do the tasks that you are supposed to do."  By giving children more to do from a young age, their life skills will improve. A person who can take care of themselves will live a more relaxed and carefree life. If a person can't handle even small tasks and has to ask for help and spend money, they will often rely on others, making it hard for them to succeed.

*“Put hats and clothes, have a fixed place, do not randomly toss, causing dirt and mess.”* The meaning of this saying is not just about putting hats and clothes in place, but also about broadly explaining and applying it to every object, to ensure that everything has its designated place. When everything has its designated place, life will be orderly, things will not get dirty or damaged, and you won’t waste time looking for things. When life is organized, one’s mind will also not be scattered. Those who seek knowledge and cultivate their character must first ensure their family is organized; this will prevent their minds from being confused and sets a good example for their children.

An elder of mine, Uncle Lu, once told me that every time he went to a branch office to check on the business, he would first go to the manager's desk to see if the desk was clean and organized. Then he would look at their files to see if they were filed neatly. He said, "If they cannot even manage these small things, I do not believe that they can manage big things." Therefore, a child's ability to do things must be rooted in small details from childhood. In addition to objects having designated places, in the home, you must check to ensure that switches are turned off; otherwise, it can lead to waste, or worse, danger.

**Before Heading Out, We Should Always Check**

Therefore, before we head out, we should always check if the gas and lights are turned off. When children develop the habit of checking these items from a young age, they will naturally become more meticulous.

Once, there was a power outage where I lived. After turning on the electric water heater, I forgot to turn it off before going to give a lecture. Later, when the power came back on, the hot water from the heater kept flowing. When I returned home after the lecture and saw this, my heart ached. Because of my own small oversight, we had wasted so much for our descendants. After this incident, I reminded myself that after turning on any switches, I should not be in a hurry. I must turn them off properly before leaving, otherwise, a small oversight could cause a great deal of loss.

Clothing, hats, and all daily necessities should be placed in their designated spots. "Do not store them carelessly, lest they become soiled." Otherwise, if you do not cherish them, their lifespan will be greatly shortened. Although these items are inanimate, if you treat them well, they will last a long time. "Those who love others are constantly loved by others; those who cherish things are constantly cherished by things." For example, your stomach – if you overeat every day, it might give out on you in thirty or forty years. However, if you respect it, have meals at regular times, don’t overeat, and don’t let it go hungry, your stomach will repay you by serving you well for a long time. Therefore, we should cherish all things.

When things have their designated place, our lives will be orderly. We often observe that children, and even some adults, find themselves in the situation of searching frantically for a lost item, turning the whole house upside down. They get angry with themselves, and the whole family atmosphere becomes unpleasant. Therefore, a small lack of attention can lead to a great loss of time and energy. If good habits are not developed, one day at work, you might have a very important contract placed in your care. Because you are used to putting things down anywhere, you might forget about it a few days later. Then, you will likely be unable to find it, and as a result, lose your job. So, these daily habits do indeed affect a person’s entire life.

There was a child at home who didn’t sweep the floor. An elder came to his house and said to him, "The floor is so dirty, why don’t you sweep it?” The child replied with great arrogance, “My hands are meant to sweep the world.” This elder responded, "If you cannot sweep a room, how can you sweep the world?" The same logic applies. If one cannot even tidy up their own house, how can they possibly become a successful entrepreneur? It's impossible.

The *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student) is also about management; it's basic management science. The habit of orderliness should be ingrained from a young age. If an MBA graduate applies for a job, but their home and personal room are very messy, would you dare hire them? The business management they learned would just be theory.

Nurturing a child’s ability to conduct themselves and handle matters must be grounded from a young age. Because successful entrepreneurs have sharp eyes and can see a child's level of maturity in conducting themselves and handling things. You cannot deceive them. Many people believe that with a university or master’s degree, they can find a good job. However, if they are unable to conduct themselves or handle matters well, they will not be hired by these outstanding entrepreneurs. If they are hired, it would mean the entrepreneur lacks discernment, and the fate of the business will not be long lasting. Therefore, to ensure that your child has the chance to work for a very promising company in the future, you must help them establish a solid foundation now.

My profound understanding of this comes from my time at the Pure Land Learning College in Australia. I was assigned to wash dishes – I had to wash all the bowls and cooking utensils for sixty or seventy people. While washing the dishes there, I suddenly realized a life philosophy: The things you are meant to do in your life, you cannot escape them. When should these things be done? Why not strive to cultivate good deeds when you are strong and healthy? What needs to be done should be done well in your youth. Putting in the effort and working hard when you are young, will bring blessings in old age, which then you can enjoy. If you are lazy in your youth, and often extravagant, old age will surely be miserable. Therefore, I was very happy to wash dishes there. One day, Uncle Lu came to the kitchen. He was about to walk past, but he suddenly stopped and said to me, "By watching you wash dishes, I can tell you’ve had a very fortunate life.” You see, just from my action of washing dishes, he could see my background clearly, because I was clumsy. From this, I realized that you cannot hide from the eyes of a truly wise elder. Therefore, when a child is respectful and courteous to others, and works diligently, you can rest assured and not worry about them not having mentors later in life.

When life is orderly, one's mind is settled. When the mind is settled, wisdom arises constantly. A settled mind is like a calm, clear lake, without any waves, able to reflect everything around it clearly. While in Australia, I once went to Uncle Lu's room while he was taking out clothes. I saw that his clothes were folded so neatly, just like the clothes displayed in a Giordano store. When everything is arranged so neatly and has its designated place, you can immediately find whatever you need. Your mind can stay calm, not be chaotic, and you will be able to handle things in an orderly way. These habits are incredibly important, and we must start with ourselves, and then guide our children to develop these good habits.

**5. Dress Cleanly and Appropriately, Avoid Designer Brands and Strange Attire**

*Clothes should be valued for their cleanliness, not their extravagance.* *Let them conform to one’s status and suit the family’s circumstances.*

Respect for clothes is most importantly about keeping them arranged neatly and washing them cleanly, not necessarily buying expensive clothes. Those who love others are constantly loved by others; those who cherish things are constantly cherished by things. The universe is like a mirror, reflecting your attitude. If you smile, it smiles back at you. I once visited the memorial hall of Teacher Li Bingnan. His clothes were decades old, but they still looked clean because he had that sense of cherishing them. When we have a heart that cherishes things, those things will last a long time. When your things last a long time, your life will be much easier because you will not need to spend money. When your life is easier, you don't need to rely on others. A child who does not need to rely on others will be honest and principled. A child who doesn't cherish things will spend a lot of money every day. When that happens, they will be easily tempted by material desires and become vulnerable. So, it is said, "Frugality cultivates integrity; diligence can compensate for shortcomings." Only through frugality and cherishing things can we nurture the virtue of integrity. So, by teaching your children to respect things and understand frugality from a young age, you are helping them cultivate honesty and principled behavior.

A teacher bought many cups. One day during a class, he taught for a bit longer than usual, and the students became very thirsty. Then, he brought out all kinds of cups and said, "Students, let’s get some water using these cups.” When the students came forward, they spent a long time choosing which cup they wanted. They even forgot about the purpose of getting water. They wasted their time choosing the cups. Similarly, the most important thing about clothes is that they keep you warm, cover you, and are a form of politeness and respect towards others. However, people often go beyond the needs of material items and pursue designer brands and vanity, which can be quite tiresome.

What is true beauty? Modern society’s education is misguiding the next generation. Saying that a great figure is beauty is a distorted view of aesthetics. When society is distorted, the next generation will pursue this direction. Therefore, you can see how many people get plastic surgery and body sculpting done nowadays. Actually, plastic surgery often looks unnatural and uncomfortable. Many people sacrifice their health in pursuit of a slim figure. When people pursue this kind of beauty, they feel empty inside and constantly think about whether others notice them. They spend a lot of money on an outfit and wear it to the office and then have to tell everyone, "Do you notice something different about me today?" If they meet someone who is less observant, and they say, “Not really,” they will be furious. They spent so much money and they were not noticed! Those who live in vanity and in the eyes of others are truly suffering. Actually, women's beauty lies within. We say the more you look at someone, the more you feel comfortable with them, meaning they are personable, and you can get along with them for a long time. This kind of beauty radiates from their inner virtue.  The other kind of so-called beauty makes you think they are very beautiful at first glance, but as you look longer you start to realize it isn’t, and when they open their mouth, they can make people stumble. This kind of beauty doesn't last more than a month. Therefore, we need to guide our children to have the correct view and perspective on beauty.

When people pursue material things excessively, it will cause the decline of the family and even the nation. A junior high student, after passing the high school entrance exam, said to his father, "Dad, you have to buy me some designer clothes." His parents felt baffled, "Why do we have to buy you designer clothes?" His son continued, "Because I passed the high school entrance exam. I saved you tens of thousands of yuan in sponsorship fees, so you should buy me some designer clothes." He was bargaining with his parents! Because in China, if you do not pass the exam, you can still spend a large sum of money to enter the school. As you can see, children have been distorted by vanity and have no idea that studying is their responsibility. It was originally their responsibility, yet they are negotiating with their parents for material enjoyment.

During the time of King Zhou of Shang, King Zhou gifted Daji a pair of ivory chopsticks. There was a wise minister named Jizi who saw this and thought that the Shang Dynasty was doomed. How could the demise of a nation be understood just by looking at a pair of chopsticks? Let’s consider it carefully. If he's using ivory chopsticks, the cups he is using would likely be made of rhinoceros horn, and the bowls and plates would likely be made of gold or silver. Would there be vegetables and tofu on gold and silver plates? What kind of food would be served? Exotic delicacies. When he eats exotic delicacies, would he wear a t-shirt while eating? What would he wear? Fine silks and satins. When he wears fine silks and satins, would he live in a small wooden house? What would he live in? A magnificent palace. When one's lifestyle becomes this extravagant, what is the most needed thing? Money. And where will the money come from? From the common people, exploiting their hard-earned wealth. When you exploit and extort the people's wealth, the people will rise up and overthrow you. A nation that is extravagant will surely perish; a family that is extravagant will surely be impoverished. Therefore, the trend of extravagance should never be allowed to grow. We must be very cautious about this.

There was a Teacher Li who, after finishing his calligraphy lesson, was contacted by a student’s parent who could not pick up their child. The parent said, “Could you please take my son to dinner tonight?” Teacher Li agreed. When they were at the table, this child very smoothly made a gesture to call the waiter over and said, “Bring me two Cokes.” Then, he took the menu and said very confidently, “I want this dish and that dish.” The child was only six or seven years old, but he was very experienced at ordering food. Teacher Li was amazed. After he was finished ordering, Teacher Li took a look at the menu, and all the dishes he ordered were quite expensive. Teacher Li suddenly realized where the child had learned these actions. His father was an official who probably often took him to hotels for meals. The child was influenced by this type of atmosphere and became very extravagant and wasteful. Therefore, we still must be frugal and diligent in managing the household.

The way one dresses does not only affect oneself and the family, but it also affects the overall social atmosphere. When clothes damage good morals and influence society, the karmic consequences are huge. In history, many people died prematurely because of the way they dressed, because their influence was so widespread. This was true in ancient times, and it is also true in modern times. For example, some celebrities with very unconventional clothing styles might also have very short lives because they are misguiding many teenagers. The karmic consequences are never off, and if you pay attention, you can also find the truth of karma in our current society.

*“Let them conform to one’s status.”* The way you dress should conform to your social status. *“Suit the family’s circumstances.”* You should buy clothes according to your family’s financial situation. During the Spring and Autumn period, Yan Ying wore the same clothes for over thirty years. Because he was the Prime Minister, this frugal practice influenced the entire court. I visited the memorial hall of Teacher Li Bingnan and saw that the clothes that Teacher Li wore for many decades were still very clean. Teacher Li's underwear and socks were repaired again and again. Teacher Li set an example for us, and the money he saved was all saved for the benefit of the masses. Whenever we meet anyone, we should make them feel that our clothing is very simple and clean. In places where others can't see, we should save as much as possible. We must learn from Teacher Li Bingnan!

I once heard an elder say that before he got married, he thought it would be easy to support a wife since she ate so little. But after he married, he found it quite difficult, because things and food were cheap, but clothes were expensive. So, he said that when he went shopping for clothes with his wife, she would say, “Buy it, buy it,” as soon as she saw something she liked. He later realized that a woman’s closet always seems to be missing one more item. The most important purpose of clothes is to keep warm and cover the body, and it is certainly not for showing off.

However, when we are buying things, we often forget their original purpose, and we become attached to the habit of vanity. I heard about a group of very wealthy women who watched a Paris fashion show (on TV). After watching it, they wanted a certain piece and took a plane to buy it the next day. If you spend money like this, even if you have mountains of gold and silver, it will not be enough to spend. Because once this kind of example is set, who will learn it most thoroughly? Their children will learn it thoroughly. Of course, this type of person will not be wealthy for more than one generation. When we buy clothes, we must follow *“Let them conform to one’s status and suit the family’s circumstances.”* We should buy clothes according to our own financial circumstances and never try to pretend to be richer than we are.

**6. Do Not Be Picky About Food, Do Not Overeat, Do Not Eat Unhealthy Food**

*With food, do not be picky; eat moderately, not excessively.*

Regarding food, we should pursue a balanced diet and absolutely not be a picky eater. In the process of eating, we should have moderation; not too much and not too little. It is best to eat until you are 70-80% full and not overeat to the point of hurting your stomach. “Illness enters through the mouth.” When eating, we must have discernment. We should eat nutritious food and avoid eating toxins. Many foods contain a lot of toxins and carcinogens. We also often hear the term "junk food." Are you eating junk food?

Currently, statistics show there are ten major junk foods. First, fried foods. Eating too many fried foods can easily lead to blood vessel blockage. Strokes and arteriosclerosis are related to this, so we should eat fewer fried foods. Second, pickled foods. These foods, which are pickled with a lot of salt, can cause or increase the likelihood of nasopharyngeal cancer or cause ulcers, so we should also eat less of these. Some more naturally pickled foods are fine, but you need to understand how they are made. Third, meat products. If you put a fresh piece of meat in the air, how long will it take to start to smell bad? About three hours. But these meat products can actually be stored for three to five years. What makes that possible? A lot of preservatives are added. So, it is said that now, even mummification does not require preservatives. Many people do not decompose after death because they are eating these preservatives long-term. Meat products contain nitrites, which are one of the three major carcinogens. What is the current cancer rate? One in four. Is there an updated number? It's already progressing towards one in three. Every effect has its cause. Dietary choices and negative emotions are the causes of cancer. Therefore, if you are very careful with your diet and also maintain a good mood, and if you constantly recite the *Di Zi Gui,* focus on your own shortcomings rather than others', and strive to change your shortcomings, you will have the joy of growth. Therefore, we must manage our mind. If your mind is good and you are careful with your food, you are guaranteed to be immune to cancer.

Fourth, crackers. Because many crackers are specifically made to appeal to the taste of consumers, they often have many fillings. All of these fillings contain a lot of sugar and calories. When you eat too much of these, the carbohydrates will turn into fat, which is why more and more people are becoming overweight. Where did the trend of eating sweets come from? Western countries really like to eat sweets, so when you compare the overweight people here to them, our overweight people are really nothing. They sometimes have to take up several seats on a plane, which is very scary. Therefore, we cannot indulge our desires, as that will cause suffering for ourselves and harm our loved ones.

Fifth, sodas and colas. Because sodas are stimulating and acidic, they wear down the walls of the stomach, making them thin and causing inflammation of the stomach. Also, what are orange sodas and lemon sodas made of? They are made from petroleum, definitely not from apples or oranges. They are extracted from petroleum, and the compound used has the same flavor as oranges and many other fruits. I used to buy these supplies and make orange sodas for my students to show them. They would watch me make fragrant orange sodas from bottles of chemicals. I suffered greatly when I was young. I have a vivid memory of my grandparents feeding me well-cooked porridge. Therefore, when someone is unhealthy, they really let their family down. I have learned a painful lesson, and I hope that our children will not repeat these mistakes. Therefore, a parent's correct understanding of diet is the key to a child's lifelong happiness.

Sixth, instant noodles. Instant noodles are too high in calories, and many preservatives are added, which is bad for your body. Seventh, canned foods, which also contain a lot of preservatives. Eighth, salted plums and preserved fruits. There have been many reports that the places where they make salted plums are very dirty. So, even insects will not eat these salted plums. You see, their ability to discern is better than humans'. Because eating one of these plums can make them die. Humans can eat a hundred of these and not die. They can sense that the food has too many toxins and will not eat it. Ninth, frozen foods. The human body is like a machine. Let’s use this analogy. If you pour a bucket of cold water on a running motor, and the motor gets hot, then you pour another bucket of cold water, how long will that engine last? It could have lasted ten years, but now it will likely break down in three years. The human body is the same. Our body temperature is always around 37 degrees Celsius. When you drink ice water, the ice water will deplete a lot of energy in your body, so your constitution will slowly decline. I am heartbroken by this. When I was a student, no teacher taught me these things. I only began to learn this knowledge in university. So, I don't touch those frozen things anymore. It is better late than never.

Many women today have gynecological diseases related to eating ice. In particular, during a woman's menstrual cycle, those days are a period of detoxification. There are many toxins that need to be expelled. If you eat ice at this time, the heat expands and cold contracts, so the uterus will constrict. The toxins that need to be expelled will not be expelled. So, how long will these toxins remain inside the body? If things go smoothly, it will be 28 days. These toxins will circulate in your body, which will cause a variety of gynecological diseases. Ladies, please don't look at me so gravely. You need to make a choice for your life.

Tenth, grilled and barbecued foods. Eating a grilled chicken leg is equivalent to the toxins of 60 cigarettes. The carcinogens it contains is the number one of the top three carcinogens. These are the statistics, so eating these foods is very harmful to your health. We’ve come to realize that there are so many things to do in life and we need to live a valuable life. The first step is to have a healthy body. So, when you are unable to resist the urge to eat these things, you must remember Wen Tianxiang’s saying, “Who has not faced death since ancient times? Let my loyal heart illuminate the annals of history.” There are still many things I need to do, so I cannot ruin my body. Then, you may back away from eating it.

**7. Drinking and Smoking are Harmful to Health. Teenagers Should Not Drink or Smoke**

*When young, do not drink alcohol. Intoxication is most shameful.*

"When young, do not drink alcohol. Intoxication is most shameful." Alcohol is like a poison that flows through the intestines. So, children must absolutely not develop the habit of drinking alcohol from a young age. Furthermore, not only does alcohol harm your own body, it also endangers the lives and property of others. Many traffic accidents are related to alcohol.

I hope this is helpful and captures the original text well! Let me know if you need any adjustments or have other text for me to translate.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, clarity, and a natural-sounding English flow, while retaining the original tone.

**Book Translation:**

Intoxication leads to irrationality and irreversible consequences, therefore, it is crucial to abstain from alcohol from a young age. Of course, using alcohol for medicinal purposes is acceptable. In very cold regions, a little alcohol can promote blood circulation.

Besides alcohol, harmful substances must also be avoided. For example, smoking is also detrimental to health, not only harming the smoker's body but also endangering the health of others. You see, it's possible that a smoker might not develop lung cancer, but their spouse or children could. Why? Because what the smoker inhales, they also exhale, but their family members inhale and don't exhale. We are social beings, and one person's actions will absolutely affect others. Do we want a positive or a negative impact? Naturally, we should strive to make a positive impact.

**8. Cultivate Proper Posture from a Young Age**

*   *Walk with composure, stand upright, bow deeply and respectfully, prostrate with reverence.*

This scripture teaches that one should stand and sit with proper posture. Our ancestors also left us with good reminders: "Stand like a pine, lie like a bow, walk like the wind, and sit like a bell." In fact, these habits are in harmony with nature and are best for the body. "Stand like a pine" means that the spine should be straight to prevent scoliosis. Many people suffer from bone spurs nowadays. Why? If you have a chance, go to a bus stop and observe. You will see a line of people waiting, each standing differently, with many leaning to one side. Many young people these days seem to have lost their bones, leaning against anything they find. This causes their bones to bend over time. Our previous generation would glare at their children if they did not stand properly and would rap their knuckles if they did not hold their chopsticks right. So, these habits are formed from a young age and become natural later in life. If they are not formed early, it will be difficult to cultivate them later. I myself did not do a good job of "standing like a pine," so, dear friends, if you see me slouching, don’t hesitate to use your “Buddha’s Palm” and remind me. Because we must take care of our bodies to honor our parents and those who support and care about us.

What is the standard, the best way to stand? For men, the proper stance is feet shoulder-width apart, and the chest should be puffed out – this posture is called “standing tall between heaven and earth.” If you go into negotiations or business meetings with that posture, people will see you as impressive and worthy of trust. If you slouch and say, “We’re here to talk big business today,” they’ll be less interested. This kind of dignified presence inspires confidence. So stand with feet shoulder-width apart, head not held too high, and eyes looking straight ahead. Before entering into negotiations, stand well and visualize a vast ocean before you – let your mind be like it. This is the proper way for men to stand. For women, one foot in front of the other is acceptable. Like pageant contestants, they stand elegantly – it is crucial. That’s how to stand, like a pine.

“Lie like a bow” – lie on your right side. Lying on the left side will put pressure on the heart and stomach and cause discomfort. So, lying on the right side is best for the body. “Walk like the wind.” “Wind” is very fast, but without any loud noise, so walk with light steps. Often, we hear our neighbors upstairs walking loudly at night. We have to be understanding because they feel life is short. We should quickly introduce them to the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* so that they know raising children doesn’t have to be so hard. So our actions should always be mindful of whether they are causing a burden to others. That is walking like the wind. When walking, men should walk along the two sides of an imaginary line while women should walk directly along the line, this makes them look more graceful. When walking, men should not sway their shoulders side to side, or people will get dizzy just looking at them.

“Sit like a bell.” Let’s demonstrate how to sit. When women sit, their feet should be together, right hand on top of the left, resting lightly on their left thigh. There was a guzheng (Chinese zither) school principal who trained her employees in etiquette. When parent-teacher meetings were held, all the teachers sat this way. After the meeting, the parents said: "Where did you find these employees? They are so elegant!" Initially, many of the mothers sat however they pleased, in all kinds of postures. But seeing all the teachers sitting so elegantly, they slowly straightened up. The environment can indeed have a subtle influence. If we sit properly, our family culture will encourage it. If a father puts his feet on the table when he sits, his children may emulate him. Parents say, "We can trust you with our kids." Our words, actions, and appearance increase people's trust in us.

"Walk with composure, stand upright, bow deeply and respectfully, prostrate with reverence.” When a woman stands, she can place her right hand over her left hand. If wearing a skirt, the hands can be slightly lowered; if wearing pants, they can be raised a little higher. You can also stand straight or let your arms hang naturally. In short, the movement must be graceful. Men should have a dignified manner, so their feet should be shoulder-width apart, with eyes looking straight ahead. This is the proper standing posture.

The scripture also mentions "bow deeply and respectfully, prostrate with reverence." When bowing, it should be a ninety-degree bow. One friend, on his first day of class, saw everyone greeting each other, and he just nodded his head. On his fifth day, before leaving, he came to the teachers and said that his previous bows did not count, because they were not from a place of inner reverence. So, he formally bowed three times to the teachers. Whether our bows come from the heart is something we know ourselves and others can sense. Proper etiquette should be more than superficial; it should come "from the inner self and be expressed externally."

*Do not step on the threshold, do not lean lopsided, do not sit with legs sprawled, and do not shake your leg.*

Men can sit with their feet slightly apart and their hands resting naturally on their thighs. Thirty years ago, in family or group photos, whose posture was like that? The father's posture was always like that – sitting that way showed authority.

When sitting, we should also pay attention to details, just as the text mentions: "Do not step on the threshold, do not lean lopsided, do not sit with legs sprawled, and do not shake your leg." “Do not step on the threshold” means not to step on things while standing or sitting. For example, in ancient times, there were thresholds; stepping on them looks unsightly and disrespectful. It also shows carelessness. Furthermore, stepping on things can easily cause them to break. This is also an attitude of cherishing objects. Nowadays, many children sit with their feet on chair or desk legs; we must correct them in time. Our reading classes look fine, but if you look underneath, it is a mess. Some shake their legs from side to side while reciting, while others step on the legs of chairs or desks. Sometimes, in the middle of class, a child's chair will suddenly collapse – why? Because the leg of the chair was broken by being stepped on. So we must correct children’s actions so they become a natural habit. If it's already a habit, we must remind them patiently.

“Do not lean lopsided,” means don't stand leaning to one side or against something – this is not good. When they are this casual even in their posture, would you dare give them important tasks? If small things are ignored, they will not suddenly become cautious when doing big things. So, “Do not fail to do good even if it's small, nor do evil even if it's small.” A person’s great ability is built from small beginnings, and a person’s bad habits come from neglecting life’s small details.

“Do not sit with legs sprawled” – *ji* refers to a dustpan or winnowing basket, and the opening is very wide. So "do not sit with legs sprawled" means not to sit with legs spread too far apart. This is considered unrefined, especially for women, and can cause negative speculation.

"Do not shake your leg" means not to shake your leg when sitting. Some people not only shake their legs left and right but also up and down. We once attended a meeting where the person beside us shook his leg from beginning to end, making us dizzy. If the person in front of you was shaking his leg during class, you’d find it very distracting. This habit must be changed.

Why do people shake their legs while talking? What’s their inner state like? Anxious and restless. When people are anxious, they are just going through the motions when they talk to you. And many things they consider important, like their children's education or family relations, they cannot resolve. They are always on their mind, but they are forced to continue with daily tasks. They cannot completely focus on the present with a sincere heart, so they shake when they feel anxious. People nowadays do live complicated lives, and it’s not easy to calm the mind. It requires both increased wisdom and vigilance over our external actions. We should constantly reflect on our words and actions to see if they are inappropriate. In time, our words and actions will become internalized and we will maintain a respectful attitude with a sense of decorum.

**9. Cultivate the Habit of Consideration and Cherish Objects from a Young Age**

*   *Slowly raise the curtain, without noise; make a wide turn, without touching the edge.*

This passage generally teaches us to develop a careful yet courageous attitude. We often say we should be courageous and careful, so we should strive for gentle and respectful movements. But when facing challenges, we should not be afraid of difficulties. Hence, “do not fear difficulty.” Because we are careful, we act with prudence and avoid problems. Courage and care are cultivated from the small details of life.

"Slowly raise the curtain, without noise." When we raise a curtain, we should be gentle and avoid making loud noises. People live and work together, so we should be aware of whether our actions will cause trouble or annoyance to others. For example, someone may be sleeping next to you; perhaps they haven’t slept well for a few days, and they just fell asleep. Then you raise the curtain very loudly, and they will be unable to sleep again. Or in a library, a quiet place for reading, if you pull the curtain loudly, you might startle someone. So, "slowly raise the curtain without noise" also tells us that we should consider whether each of our words and actions will make others uneasy and whether our sounds will be too loud. When we constantly think of others, our hearts will become more and more tender. When our heart becomes more tender, we truly embody compassion.

In daily life, how else can our loud sounds annoy others? For example, when we live together, if we walk loudly at night, we will surely bother others. When we get up to go to the bathroom at night, if we open the door loudly, many will be awakened. When I was studying in Australia, Uncle Lu told me that when getting up to use the bathroom at night, one should be quiet and make sure that the door is closed when flushing the toilet. Otherwise, it will disturb many people's peace.

So, how do you tell if someone is educated? We say that considering others is the most important thing to learn. It’s not just saying it, it’s putting it into practice every moment. In addition to walking quietly and closing doors gently, we shouldn't make too much noise while eating. If you eat too loudly, everyone will feel uncomfortable. Why is there so much noise when eating? Because your mouth is not closed. So I've told many friends that you should close your mouth while eating because we represent more than just ourselves. We represent our company, our group, and even the Chinese people when we travel, so we must always pay attention to our actions.

We mentioned earlier that a sign in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris says, “Please Do Not Speak Loudly.” Who is it for? The French are famous, but why are we like that? So, if Chinese people are loud in public places today, it’s because they are that way at home too. So a person’s self-cultivation is cultivated at home when no one else is watching. That is why the Chinese emphasize the practice of “being careful when alone.” When alone, we should still keep our movements and speech soft and slow. When we are used to it, we will naturally act elegantly in public places. So when we see children yelling and running around at the airport, we should stop them. You can tell them the story of Notre Dame in Paris – we must not let the Chinese people lose face before the world. When we have this awareness, we will have a broader understanding of this scripture in the small details of our daily lives. For example, when you come home late at night and get your keys to open the door, you will also be quiet. You will quickly turn off your engine when driving home late at night because your sensitivity to noise will have increased. This is how you develop the ability to be mindful.

"Slowly raise the curtain," besides not disturbing others with noise, it also embodies the concept of cherishing objects. When we are gentle with things, they won't break easily. If we are usually rough and forceful with things, items that could have lasted five or ten years might break within a year. So from the concept of cherishing objects, we must also remind ourselves not to be too rough. For example, if you are too rough with your clothes, they will easily tear. So we must remind our children to cherish things in small ways. When our actions are gentle, we will not damage things frequently in life. When I was young, I was always getting hurt. I would always get cut or break a tooth. I remember once I ran into the kitchen, slipped, and broke several teeth. It wasn't until I went to university and studied diligently that these things slowly decreased. In fact, the main reason people get hurt is carelessness, leading to reckless behavior.

So, to correct oneself, we must start from the root – from the mind. And to cultivate the mind, we must be mindful of the details of our daily life and be eager to learn. So, "slowly raise the curtain, without noise; make a wide turn, without touching the edge." In school, this is a common mistake for children. They are not paying attention, so they bump into a desk corner and get hurt. From this scripture, we can teach students to be careful of their safety at all times. Nowadays, the accidental death rate for children is rising because they lack this awareness. So, teachers and parents must constantly remind them, otherwise it will be too late if an accident occurs.

*Hold an empty container as if it were full; enter an empty room as if someone were there.*

"Hold an empty container as if it were full." Why should we hold an empty plate with the same care as if it were full? It means that even when holding something light, we should be careful and not underestimate it, or we could easily drop and break it. Many high-tech products are light, but they can be very expensive. If we are not careful with these small actions, we could lose a month's salary in an instant. So, we must pay close attention and remind ourselves in the smallest details.

“Enter an empty room as if someone were there.” Even when in a place where no one is around, we should act as if someone were there. This is the attitude of being "careful when alone." Our attitudes and behaviors should not change just because no one is watching – this is very important. So, we must be consistent and not say one thing and do another.

Children are often louder when no one is around. For example, when we travel and hike, many children shout loudly. I would tell my students that the masters of these mountains are the animals and plants, because they have lived there for years. And what are you? You are a guest who visits their home once in a while. Would a guest shout in someone's home? That is too embarrassing. The animals would laugh at us, thinking “This person has no manners.” We should respect all things, so we cannot shout when hiking. It can disturb the animals. Also, loud sounds can vibrate rocks. If a rock is already loose, the sound might cause it to fall. The legend of Meng Jiangnu crying down the Great Wall of China may be exaggerated, but the sound vibrations of human voices can make rocks fall, which is possible. So, enter an empty room as if someone were there – it also requires caution.

When children visit other people’s homes, they often look around when the host is busy in the kitchen. Is that right? No, it's not respectful to the host. It's especially wrong to enter the host's bedroom. These things must be emphasized to children. For example, if a child has been looking around many rooms and something goes missing, who is the first suspect? I had a friend who went to play at a classmate's house when he was little. Some money disappeared from his classmate's father's room. The next day, his classmate accused him of stealing it. Everyone in the class labeled him a thief. If you try to defend yourself, it is impossible to prove your innocence because you cannot prove that you didn't take it since you were in that room for a while. So we must always be vigilant and avoid suspicion to prevent misunderstanding. "Enter an empty room as if someone were there" – this avoids suspicion.

*A Summary of Proper Manners* says: “Do not adjust your shoes in a melon field, and do not adjust your hat under a plum tree." This means that if you walk past a melon field, don’t bend down to tie your shoe, because to someone watching from afar it will look like you’re stealing melons. And if you adjust your hat under a plum tree, it will look like you are trying to pick the plums. We must avoid suspicion. Therefore, *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* says “When entering a door, ask if anyone is present; when entering the hall, raise your voice.” When entering someone’s house, do not walk around exploring the house.

**10. Don't Act Hastily, Be Disregardful, or Be Afraid of Difficulty**

*   *Do not act hastily; haste makes mistakes. Do not fear difficulty; do not treat lightly.*

“Do not act hastily; haste makes mistakes.” “Haste” leads to chaos. So the way to counteract chaos is to slow down. Slowing down avoids regret, and retreating avoids disaster. So, being organized and methodical helps to avoid mistakes. And understanding when to advance and when to retreat will help to avoid trouble. “Do not act hastily” also needs to be combined with the teaching of “prudence” to do things well. For example, “Arrange your hats and clothes in their proper places; do not place them haphazardly, or they will become dirty.” When things are in their proper places, you will not lose them. After using something, return it to its place.

For example, after showering, we should always return the faucet to its original position. Otherwise, if someone else opens the faucet, they will get wet. So, we need to be thorough in our tasks. After using something, we should check whether it is back in its original place so that we or others can find it. When we go out for a long time, such as a week, we must check that the gas and electricity are off at home to avoid unnecessary waste of energy. So we must be prudent; “Do not act hastily; haste makes mistakes.” When you promise something to someone, immediately write it down in your planner. Look at it every day. Mark which tasks are completed and remind yourself to finish those that are not. If children develop this attitude from a young age, they will be prudent and responsible.

If your child is in the first grade of elementary school and calls you to say, “Mom, I forgot my Chinese homework book. I finished it yesterday, and the teacher will be checking it in the next class. Can you quickly bring it to me?" What will you do? Many parents would bring it. Although it is a small thing, doing it right and doing it wrong can make a huge difference to a child’s attitude.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English:

**The Importance of Consistent Discipline and Teaching Responsibility**

Uncle Lu once told me a story. His daughter forgot her homework notebook for the first time. She called home and asked her father to bring it to her. Uncle Lu said to his daughter, "Forgetting your homework is your own fault, so you must be responsible for your actions. If there's a punishment, then you must accept it." And with that, he hung up the phone. Would you be able to hang up like that?

Therefore, when educating children, it's essential to balance kindness and strictness. There are times when you must be firm and uphold principles, and during those times, there can be no compromise. That afternoon, his daughter came home, looking a little glum. Uncle Lu then asked her, "Did your teacher scold you? Were you punished?" The little girl nodded, "Yes." Uncle Lu then said, "Let me teach you a method so that from now on, you won’t be punished for forgetting your homework." Her spirits, which had been low, immediately lifted at this. Uncle Lu explained, "You need to use your school diary. Write down what subjects you have tomorrow and what you need to bring. Before going to bed, pack your bag and tick off each item as you put it in. Once it’s all ticked, you can sleep soundly." So, when children make mistakes, it's often an excellent time to educate them. If you only lose your temper, you've missed an opportunity. By teaching children from a young age to use a notebook to remind themselves what to bring, they will be less likely to forget and repeat the same mistakes.

"Don't rush, as haste makes waste." For children to be unhurried and organized, we must first set an example ourselves. I remember when I was a teenager, I often rode in my father's car. When driving, my father would often say, "Why rush? Rushing won't save you five minutes." Although it was just a casual comment from my father, it had a profound impact on me. Later, when I started driving, whenever I felt the urge to speed, I would think of those words. My father never honked the horn while driving because he didn't see any need to rush. Similarly, I rarely honk my horn either. Of course, there are situations when you need to honk, such as when you can’t see oncoming traffic, you should give a warning. Usually, we should give way to others when possible.

“Don't fear difficulties.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* contains an important teaching: "If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." This means that even if others are quicker to learn something, if we are a little slower, we should do it a hundred times until we master it. If others learn it in ten attempts, then we should be prepared to do it a thousand times if necessary. If everyone adopts this attitude, even if one's foundation is weaker, one will undoubtedly gain wisdom. When we face challenges like this, we will not be easily defeated or discouraged. Mencius said, "What kind of man was Shun? And what kind of man am I? If he put his mind to it, so can I." Therefore, Teacher Yang Shufen often encourages herself: "I can definitely do it!" Because who accompanies you for the longest time? It is yourself. Therefore, it is very important to constantly encourage and motivate yourself.

When parents do things that children should be responsible for, they are depriving the children of opportunities to learn and gain experience. As mentioned earlier, Uncle Lu didn't bring his daughter the notebook. What would have been the result if he had taken it? His daughter might have happily said, "Dad, you're so great! You grant every request; you're like the Bodhisattva of Compassion." What kind of change would that bring about in her heart? She would think, “Whenever I have a problem, I have my mom and dad, my grandparents, and even the help to take care of things.”  This is why we see so many young people today in their early twenties say things that are infuriating. Their parents and relatives bend over backward to help them, and yet they act like it is no big deal. I met a person like this in Haikou. His parents used their connections to find him a job, and he had the nerve to say, "Okay, I'll try it just to give you face.”  There are also college students who were expelled twice, and when their friends ask them what they are going to do, they say "I don’t know.”  So, you see, here is a person almost twenty years old with no sense of responsibility for himself. Why is this? It’s because he has rarely been held accountable for his actions.

When we clean up after our children’s mistakes, they will feel that someone will always come to their rescue. So, when he wants to get married, you have to help him raise money. When he wants to buy a house, you have to make arrangements for him. How long will you keep doing this? You will be exhausted. You might even have to worry about buying things for your grandchildren before you die. On October 19th of last year, *The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily* published an article by a couple advising young parents never to spoil their children. Having had a child later in life, they doted on their son. When he went to kindergarten, the teacher pointed out that their child was behaving badly, and they would try to make excuses for him. They would give him whatever he wanted. Once he graduated from college and got a girlfriend, the girlfriend said, "Tell your parents to move out so we can have the house; then I'll marry you." So what did the son do? He was the little emperor, so he commanded everyone to obey. He directly told his parents, "Get out!" His parents realized the severity of the problem and wanted to use their painful experience to advise other parents not to spoil their children.

In the 1920s, there was an eleven-year-old boy who broke a large pane of glass while playing soccer. It cost $12.50 to repair. At that time, $12.50 could buy 125 egg-laying hens, so it was a significant amount of money. His father told him, "You are responsible, so you will have to earn the money yourself to pay it back." So, from that time on, the eleven-year-old boy began to work and gradually paid back his father. Later, he became very successful in his career. That boy was former US President Ronald Reagan. So you see, when you allow children to be challenged, it cultivates a proper attitude, a sense of responsibility, and the ability to get things done. Therefore, raising children should be done with reason, not just with emotional indulgence, this is extremely important.

"Don't be careless or negligent." "Careless" means underestimating, and "negligent" means overlooking. When we are careless or negligent towards certain things, we have lost our respect and diligence. What are some things we tend to overlook or treat lightly? For example, when we give something to others, we must do so respectfully. There is an ancient saying about someone seeing many people starving, so he took some food to feed them. But he casually said, “Come, come, eat!” The starving people replied, "We won't eat food that comes with such contempt.” Your attitude can affect how others feel. So, even when giving to others, do not forget to maintain respect. In fact, the other person is providing an opportunity for us to cultivate blessings and accumulate good karma. We should be grateful.

With material things, for example, if we are going to donate or give away clothes, should we give away dirty clothes? When giving something away, be sincere and make sure the clothes are clean first. I remember when I gave a car to a friend, my father told me that when giving something to someone, you have to make sure that they are happy to receive it. But, generally, people are negligent and think, "I'm giving it to him, he should be grateful.” Often this thought of negligence means that even though your intentions were good, because of these issues, the recipient may be uncomfortable. Because I listened to my father’s teaching, I checked the car over thoroughly, and discovered that the clutch was over ten years old and wasn’t working well. Even if I gave it to him, he would have a hard time driving it, turning a kind gesture into a source of trouble and expenses. So we should always think of others. Even when giving something, we should consider how it will affect them. So, I had the car fixed before giving it to him. After driving it for a week or two, he called me and said that even though the car was over ten years old, it drove great.

When it comes to educating children, for example, if we tell our children to mop the floor, they might think, "I'm doing this because you told me to. I just need to get it over with so that I can watch my cartoons." If a child agrees to do something for you the first time, but does it carelessly and perfunctorily, and you don't correct them, they will likely continue to act in that manner. Whether children are responsible and diligent when doing things requires parents' patience in observation.

The first time your child mops the floor, you should check if they have done it properly. If the corners are still dirty, it shows that they have been careless. Moreover, they haven't finished what they started. How should one finish a task? You should ask your father to inspect it, or your supervisor to confirm it. Otherwise, it might be far from their standard. This also shows responsibility. If the father sees that it isn’t done well, he should correct them immediately. "Son, thank you for your hard work today; you did a good job,". People like to hear encouragement, so start by giving encouragement, then say, "If you just paid a little bit more attention to the corners, you would have done an excellent job. When I was your age, I couldn't do this well." Acknowledge his effort and then tell him, “Next time when I ask you to do something, you have to have me check that it's completed before going back to what you were doing." You need to teach children to be respectful and diligent in all their interactions with people and things.

**11. Stay Away from Gambling, Pornography, Video Games and Other Unwholesome Places. Don't Inquire About Absurd or Evil Matters**

"Stay away from noisy places and fights." "Noisy places and fights" refer to video game arcades, noisy places, and places of entertainment. As the saying goes, "If you stay in a room of abalone for long enough, you won't smell the stench." In such environments, children will gradually pick up bad habits like smoking and drug use. Children need to be taught to be wary of these places from a young age. There was a mother who, every time she passed one of these noisy places, would tell her young child, "These are places we shouldn't go into." By forming this view early, her child learned that these places should be avoided. We need to be mindful when educating our children.

"Do not enter places that are not beneficial to your body and mind.” Do not enter environments that do not benefit your body or mind. “Do not make friends who are not beneficial to your body and mind." Keep away from those friends with poor character. This doesn’t mean we treat them badly; rather, we should actively improve ourselves and use our virtuous behavior to influence them, in order to avoid both of us falling into bad behavior. “Do not read books that are not beneficial to your body and mind,” as well as “Do not say things that are not beneficial to your body and mind, and do not do things that are not beneficial to your body and mind.” Our words, actions, and the environments and books we are exposed to must be guarded against polluting our minds. This is very important.

When we enter the gates of a temple, we can see the Four Heavenly Kings. The Northern Heavenly King, Vaiśravaṇa, holds an umbrella, which symbolizes preventing pollution. We must be vigilant, protecting ourselves from pollution and protecting our children from it. Consider a glass of clear water. If you drop a drop of ink into it, it takes less than a second for the ink to start to spread, but how long would it take to remove the ink from the water? It would take dozens, maybe hundreds of times longer than it did to go in. As the saying goes, "It is better to not read books for a whole year than to be close to a wicked person for even one day." See how powerful pollution is! We must give our children a good environment for growth, form positive relationships, and connect with friends who have a passion for education. By helping each other, we can also achieve the benefit of “exchanging children for education” (referring to learning from different styles of parenting). Therefore, a positive environment provides the power of environmental influence.

"Don’t inquire into strange, bizarre and unorthodox matters." Children shouldn’t ask questions about strange, supernatural or chaotic things. Many modern movies are very scary, and children who watch them might have nightmares. These commercial products greatly harm children's minds. As parents, we must eliminate unhealthy things and nourish our children's kind and peaceful minds.

**12. Do Not Enter Another's Home Without Permission. Announce Yourself Upon Arrival.**

"Before entering, ask who is there. Upon entering, speak aloud."

When visiting someone, you should call ahead to see if they are home and to make sure it’s a good time to come, rather than abruptly saying, “Is it okay if I come over now?" If you are so rushed, and the other person says, “Uh, okay, I guess so,” you need to “listen with your intelligence," paying attention to their “okay, I guess so” to see if it is forced. You should take the initiative and ask: "Do you have something to do later? If it’s not a good time, I can come another time." This way, people will not feel that you are being too abrupt. Whether you are visiting or calling, you should also be considerate of the timing, and avoid calling around meal times or late at night when people are going to bed. This demonstrates that you are not thoughtful of others and are disrespectful. So when calling at any time, you should ask, “Is it a good time to talk?” When you are consistently respectful like this, people will feel comfortable and unpressured when interacting with you. Our words reveal our respect and children will naturally learn these respectful ways of speaking. This is the effect of subtle influence. When “entering,” you should ask. Knock on the door, and only enter when someone inside has responded. If they ask you to wait, you should wait there respectfully. When you enter someone's home, if no one is downstairs, should you just go upstairs? "Ask who is there; upon entering, speak aloud." You cannot be too casual with your actions, or it could cause misunderstandings. Therefore, showing respect includes avoiding suspicion, so that people don’t doubt you. So, when you arrive at someone’s home, you must ask, “Is anyone home?” If you call out several times and no one answers, you should not enter. This is about showing respect at all times.

“If someone asks who you are, answer with your name; don’t be vague using ‘I’.”
This sentence describes techniques and attitudes for communicating with others. For example, when calling someone, you should say, "Hello, this is Cai Lixu.” This allows the other person to know immediately who is calling. You shouldn’t leave them guessing. That would be rude. When calling someone, you should say, “Hello, this is Lixu. Is it a good time to talk?” When you are always thinking of the other person, they will feel comfortable. For example, when ringing someone's doorbell, and they ask, "Who is it?" you shouldn't just say, "It's me!" How would they know who “me” is? So, “don’t be vague using ‘I’ ”. These small details require our attention and reminders.

**13. If You Want to Play With Someone Else's Toys or Belongings, Ask for Their Permission First.**

"When using someone else's belongings, make sure to ask clearly. If you don't ask, it is considered stealing.”

Children's understanding of right and wrong is not fully developed. They might see something they like, and impulsively pick it up. We must use this phrase from the scripture to teach them. There was a pair of sisters. One day, the older sister scolded the younger sister, who became upset and started crying. Crying, she went to the kitchen to tell her mother, "My sister scolded me." You can't just assume that the older sister is in the wrong, you must first clarify what happened and determine what is right and wrong. Many parents believe that older siblings should always give way to younger ones. Is this always correct? Not entirely. The mother didn't rush to judgment. While cooking, she asked her daughter, “Why did your sister scold you?” She said, “Because I took her toy without asking her.” Because the child had read *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, her mother said, “When using someone else's belongings…” The little girl said, “Make sure to ask clearly.” Her mother said, “If you don't ask….” The little girl said, “It is considered stealing.” After she said “stealing,” she started crying again, “I don’t want to be a thief!” When parents and children have a shared language and a shared standard of behavior, communication is much easier, and important principles become ingrained. How long will the child remember what she learned from *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*? She will remember it for life and it will greatly benefit her.

When teaching children, “When using someone else's belongings, make sure to ask clearly,” adults must also follow this. In mainland China, a foreign company was recruiting employees. Many people applied, but the list was narrowed down to just a few finalists. The company owner deliberately said, "Something has come up, and I will be back in ten minutes." After the owner left, the finalists began to go through the files in the office. Because of this, none of the finalists were hired. They felt wronged because no one had ever taught them. We have a responsibility to promote the teachings of sages.

When we want to use something that belongs to someone, like a pen, you shouldn’t hold the pen and say, "Can I borrow this pen?” It is possible that the pen was a gift from an important friend, and you already have it in your hand, so even if the person is reluctant, they will have to say, "Okay." Therefore, you shouldn't borrow things in this way. You should ask for the person to hand the item to you. That is the polite way to do it. In the details, we must also be thoughtful of others.

**14. When Borrowing Books or Items From Classmates and Friends, Treat Them With Care and Return Them Promptly.**

“When borrowing things, return them on time. If you do, it won’t be difficult to borrow again in the future.”

When borrowing something from someone, you should be thinking about when you need to return it and take this very seriously. People who lend things to us are helping us and showing us kindness. If we are not on time returning it, it shows a lack of integrity. When you have decided when you will return it, and are worried about forgetting, you must write it on a calendar, or in a notebook or planner. If you are diligent every time you borrow something, people will be happy to lend you things again in the future. Once, during the Ming Dynasty, Song Lian borrowed a book. He had borrowed it from a wealthy family, and they told him that he had to return the book within ten days. He was very happy that they had lent it to him, even if ten days was not much time. On the tenth day, it snowed heavily. The owner of the book thought he certainly wouldn’t return it that day, but Song Lian went through the wind and snow and returned the book. The owner was very moved and also admired him. He told Song Lian that in the future, he could borrow any of his books. Therefore, if someone is reluctant to lend you something, you shouldn’t blame them. You need to reflect on yourself. We have to build social trust ourselves, and if we build trust, it will greatly benefit us. We must work toward this goal.

In today's society, the one who borrows money is the boss, and the one who lends it is the subordinate. Those who borrow money have power, and the one who lent the money has to beg to be repaid. Is this society upside down? If someone who has already got the money does not pay it back, this is extremely wicked. They have no regard for the kindness that they were shown when they were lent the money. According to the integrity of people in ancient times, as soon as you had the money, you would pay it back immediately. Moreover, trust in ancient times was different than it is now. In the Chinese culture, integrity was linked to character, and there was no need to have a written agreement. In fact, in China fifty to sixty years ago, that kind of integrity existed. My grandfather used to own a rice store. Many families didn’t have any cash, so my grandfather would give them the rice first, and during the New Year, or other holidays, most people would come to repay him. But some people didn’t come to pay because they didn’t have the money. My grandfather wouldn’t go and demand it from them. People trusted each other. They knew that if the person had money, they would pay them back. They would assume there was some difficulty, and that demanding payment would be lacking in moral character. In the past, people trusted one another.

What is trust in the West? It is about having a written agreement. People from the West assume you are not a good person, and that you won’t honor your word, and you have to prove that you will. These are very different approaches to “trust” in the East and West. And when it comes to modern people's attitudes toward “trust,” it is very much influenced by the West. If it was like the East, no one would dare to do business because they would worry that people would not honor their agreements. Therefore, we must take a moment to consider whether we are advancing or regressing.

If you fail to repay what you owe, you might think you are taking advantage of someone, but actually you are losing your social credit. In Shenzhen, a businessman made a deal with a farmer, agreeing that the farmer would sell his land to the businessman. The businessman only paid half of the money, owing another 6,000 RMB. The farmer was very angry because it was his only piece of land. People think that it is an advantage to take advantage of others. But a few days later, the farmer came to the businessman’s home with a bomb and they died together. The newspapers reported how much is a life worth? Six thousand RMB.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, fluency, and naturalness:

**Maintaining Integrity and Trust**

Therefore, we must maintain our own integrity, always remembering that when others lend us things, they are helping us. We must not forget our moral obligations and the kindness shown to us; naturally, we will become more vigilant and trustworthy. Confucius himself repeatedly emphasized the importance of "trustworthiness" in his teachings in the *Analects*. As the *Analects* states, "A people without trust cannot stand." A person without trust cannot establish a foothold in society or among people. Because society is a collective life, if everyone distrusts you, they will leave you, making it very difficult for you to develop. Confucius also said, "A man without trustworthiness, I do not know what he can do." If a person lacks trustworthiness, what else can they accomplish? Therefore, trustworthiness is extremely important for an individual.

**IV. Trustworthiness**

**1. Be Trustworthy with Classmates and Friends; Do Not Use Flowery Words to Deceive**

*“When speaking, let trustworthiness come first; deceit and falsehood, how can they be acceptable?”*

"When speaking, let trustworthiness come first." We must be trustworthy and put our words into practice, fulfilling what we say. During the Spring and Autumn period in the state of Wu, there was a man named Ji Zha. Once, the king sent him as an envoy to the state of Lu. On his way, Ji Zha passed through the state of Xu, where the ruler of Xu hosted a banquet for him. During the meal, the ruler kept staring at the sword Ji Zha was carrying, because it was a very dignified sword. Ji Zha thought to himself, “The ruler likes my sword, but the sword represents my status. Therefore, when I am an envoy to other countries, it is necessary to wear it as part of the proper etiquette. I cannot give it to him now, but I will give it to him after my mission is complete.” Later, after successfully completing his mission to Lu, he passed through Xu again and went to visit the ruler to give him the sword. Unfortunately, the ruler of Xu had passed away during this time. Upon learning this, Ji Zha went to his grave to pay his respects. After the ceremony, he casually hung the sword on a tree near the tomb. His attendants said to him, “Master, isn’t this a bit much? You didn’t promise to give the sword to the ruler, and even if you had promised, he is dead.” Ji Zha replied to his servants, “My heart had already agreed to give it to him. How could I betray my heart and promise just because he is dead?” Thus, he spoke the touching words, "I had already promised it in my heart, how can I abandon it due to his death?" The trustworthiness of the ancients was not only in their words, but also in their reluctance to violate even a single thought. They would not betray others or their own conscience. Therefore, we should learn from them.

When keeping our promises, we must treat everyone fairly, young and old. Our words should not be selective; once spoken, they must be fulfilled. Otherwise, we must think carefully before making promises. As the saying goes, "If something is not appropriate, do not lightly agree to it; if you agree lightly, you will be trapped in a difficult situation." During the Han Dynasty, there was a prefect named Guo Ji. Once, while on a tour of his jurisdiction, many children gathered around him to greet him. The children, being innocent, asked, "Prefect, when will you come back to visit us?" Guo Ji treated the children with respect and did not dismiss their words. He calculated that he would be back for another tour in a few months on a specific date and told the children. After they saw him off, the children dispersed. The next time he came on tour, it was one day earlier than the date he had promised. Therefore, when his attendants were about to enter the city, he said, “No, I have an agreement with the children, so we will spend the night in a pavilion outside the city.” Only when the promised time arrived, did Guo Ji enter the city. As expected, all the children were there waiting for him. Guo Ji practiced integrity with everyone, even children, and was unwilling to break his word to them. Therefore, Emperor Guangwu of Han greatly respected Guo Ji and praised him as "a virtuous prefect of the utmost integrity." His integrity was flawless. Guo Ji lived to the age of eighty-six and died peacefully. So, we must maintain our integrity regardless of age, status, or social standing. We should not treat anyone with disrespect and always uphold our promises.

*“When speaking, let trustworthiness come first; deceit and falsehood, how can they be acceptable?”* Deceit is dishonesty, and falsehood is using flowery words. If we do not keep our promises and look for excuses to cover up our breaches of faith, it will lead to "If we try to cover things up, it will compound our wrongdoings.” In the end, people will realize that you are unwilling to take responsibility for your broken promises, and your reputation will deteriorate. Of course, the world is unpredictable, and people may face unexpected misfortunes. If you sincerely want to keep your promise, but circumstances beyond your control prevent you from doing so, what should you do? There is one word that can resolve such issues: "Sincerity." If we are open and honest and they truly understand our situation and our sincerity, they will also give us some leeway. If you continue to cover things up, they will only become angrier, and it will be very difficult to resolve the issue.

Therefore, we should never delay keeping our promises. The longer we delay, the more difficult it becomes. A friend of mine had family members who had accumulated a lot of debt. Feeling responsible, he wanted to pay it back. He was very nervous, afraid that the lenders would be hostile. Later, his friends advised him to be frank with them. He told them, “This is my situation. If you take more aggressive retaliatory measures, it won’t benefit you or me. I sincerely want to repay the debt. I’ll pay you this much each month…” The results were very smooth. Therefore, in how we conduct ourselves, we should not overcomplicate things, but rather treat everyone with sincerity and trust.

*“Speaking much is not as good as speaking little; focus on the truth, avoid being cunning and deceitful.”* If something is the truth, just say it directly. We should never look for excuses to cover up or deny our mistakes. If we have made a mistake or failed to keep a promise, we should apologize immediately. It will be easier for the other party to accept. If we start to explain that we were too busy lately, the more we explain, the more uncomfortable the other person will feel.

*“Deceitful and cunning words, vulgar and offensive language, and the ways of the marketplace, these must all be avoided.”* "Deceitful and cunning words." "Deceit" implies deception and craftiness. Why use deceit and craftiness? It is to cover up our verbal mistakes and failures to keep our promises. If a child uses deceitful words, they may be lying. Is a child who can lie clever? If they were not clever, they would not be able to lie. A junior high student often compared himself to his classmates, so he liked to buy expensive things. His mother did not allow him to buy them. One day, he wanted to get a pair of designer glasses. His mother refused, saying, "You already have a pair; why do you need another?" When his mother refused to buy them, he went out and bought a pair himself and then returned and told his mother, “Go pay for them!” Is this clever? He didn't need to bring a cent, yet he made someone believe his mother would pay. Many parents then say, “He is so clever!” I am afraid of hearing that a child is clever. Children should be sincere and honest. Nowadays, children are using their cleverness to lie and achieve their own purposes.

A little girl and her father were walking home. There were several ice cream shops along the way. At the first one, she slowed down and told her father, “It's very hot.” Her father didn’t react. At the second one, the girl said, “It would be so nice to have an ice cream right now!” At the last one, the girl said, "This is the last one.” Her cleverness was not used in learning the teachings of the sages but rather on how to take money out of your pocket and achieve her goals. Thus, they value profit over righteousness. When a child’s thinking becomes self-centered, little by little their sense of morality will decline. If a child's cleverness is used for being a filial son, a good student, or a good citizen, then it will have been used correctly.

When a child first makes a mistake, we should address it carefully from the beginning. There are several reasons why a child might lie, and we must be good at observing these. First, they may lie for personal gain. Once, a child asked his father for two yuan. His father gave him a two-yuan bill. The child said, “Dad, I don’t want one bill; I want two one-yuan bills.” His father was puzzled. The boy told his father, "Dad, I get ten points when I go to the administrative office to hand in money. If you give me two one-yuan bills, I can go twice and get twenty points." His father was pleased and said that his son was very clever. Later, he told this to a school official who was shocked. The child was openly lying, and the father thought he was clever. He lacked educational awareness. Nowadays, parents even think the ability to lie is something to be proud of, which is very troublesome.

When schools hold fundraising events, we must guide our children to develop correct values. Once, the school launched a poverty aid drive. A child wanted to donate, and he thought about donating seven yuan and twenty cents. Is it a lot? No, but it was all of his savings. Other students' donations were made by their parents and were three hundred or five hundred yuan. Those who donated five hundred yuan received a small red flower, and those who donated a thousand received a candle. How did this child feel? He donated only seven yuan and twenty cents, and no one saw his sincerity. So, even though we initially intended to do a good deed, the motivation for donations became about receiving a small red flower or lighting a candle. The charitable atmosphere became about seeking fame and fortune. What did children learn from the process? They learned to be vain.

One of the parents donated several thousand yuan. The school gave her a small red flower, but she didn't wear it. She said that good deeds should be done out of one's own volition, not for show or praise. We must teach our children to do good without seeking recognition. Doing good is our duty. Therefore, we must examine carefully the effects of our education as parents and as teachers. Otherwise, children may develop a liking for empty praise, which would be very bad.

Second, children may lie for fun. The first time a child lies to you, you might laugh, and he might laugh too. He might think it's fun. We see many variety shows where people make fun of others, and everyone laughs. So, children feel that deceiving others is funny, which is a misunderstanding. There is a story called "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." This story is very effective when told to preschool children. A shepherd boy was bored while watching his sheep, so he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" The villagers were very honest and willing to help, so when they heard him shout, they came to chase the wolf away. But there was no wolf; he was just laughing. The second time, he lied again and played a trick on the others. The second time, fewer people came, but some did. When they saw it was just him playing a trick, they went back. The third time, a wolf really came. He shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Did anyone come? No. What happened then? Let the children think about it; they'll remember it well. Therefore, if a child lies for fun, it must be stopped immediately, and they cannot repeat it.

Third, children may lie to show off. Because children want to brag, they may exaggerate what they say. Some eight- or nine-year-olds compare themselves to each other. They say, "We have this, and we have that; we have a computer, a digital camera..." They become more and more exaggerated. As teachers or parents, we must be careful and stop them when appropriate.

The famous Song Dynasty official Sima Guang once had a competition with his sister to peel walnuts. He was very slow. Their servant told him that it would be easier to peel them if he soaked them in hot water. Sima Guang soaked the walnuts in hot water. His sister had left for a while, and when she returned, she saw him peeling them easily. She said, "Brother, you're amazing! Who taught you how to peel them so quickly?" Sima Guang said that he had learned it himself. When his father heard this, he went over to him and said, "Say the truth, don't lie to show off." Because his father criticized him harshly the first time he made a mistake, Sima Guang was very open and honest his whole life. He once said, "Everything I have ever done, I would be comfortable telling anyone.” This was the result of correct and timely guidance from his parents, and not by accident.

Fourth, children may lie to cover up their mistakes. Many children become nervous when they make a mistake because they are afraid of being discovered by adults. Once, a child broke a clothes hanger. In fact, is a broken hanger easy to fix? Just do it and it will be fine. But he didn’t know, and he was nervous about being punished. So, he told the other students nearby not to tell the teacher. The teacher happened to be right there and came over right away, which startled him. Children are still young. If you teach them in a timely manner, their perspectives can change quickly. The teacher immediately told him, "Unintentional mistakes are called mistakes. Intentional mistakes are called wrongdoings. Breaking the hanger is not serious, but not telling the teacher is serious because you will lose the teacher’s trust. If you admit your mistakes, and change, then the mistake is gone. And you can also learn how to fix things.” The teacher was very patient and helped him fix the hanger. Thus, if you grasp these key moments well, children will develop the correct attitude. When children try to cover up their mistakes, we must also be careful to observe them. Otherwise, they might develop bad habits, which would be very troublesome.

Fifth, children may lie because they are influenced by their parents. One video stated that adults tell an average of twenty-five lies a day. If adults lie so many times in one day, then children will be influenced without being aware of it. For example, a mother is on the phone while her son and his father are present. When the mother answers the phone, she says, “My husband is not here.” And the child says, "But Dad is here, how can he not be here?" The child becomes confused. Therefore, we should never lie when children are present. Of course, we should not lie even when children are not around. Thus, we must learn to refuse when necessary. If you don’t learn to refuse, people won’t know your limits and the principles that you live by. When you should refuse, you should just refuse; your friends will follow your principles, so why hide and cover things up? Why make simple things so complicated? These are "deceitful and cunning words." We should pay attention to the reasons why children lie.

If children can keep their word, this lays a good foundation for their future development in society. A friend of mine once saw other people eating popsicles when he was young. Unable to resist the temptation, he stole a little money from his father and went to buy one. His father, being very sharp, saw him and followed him to see what he was up to. When he bought the popsicle and was about to eat it, he looked up and saw his father. He was so frightened that he began to tremble. His father didn't say a word, just took him home and gave him a sound beating. This made him remember it, and he never forgot it his entire life. Even after, when he walked past the place where the money was kept, he would start to tremble, afraid to do it again. Later, when he grew up, he went to work in another area, far from home, and lived in the company dormitory of his boss. Every morning, he would help clean the house. Once, while cleaning, he found one or two hundred yuan on the floor and gave it to his boss’s wife. After a while, it was strange; the amount had increased to three hundred, then five hundred yuan. Again, he picked it up and gave it to her. He said that the highest amount he had picked up had been over a thousand. He worked for this company even though he did not have much education. The boss gave him good opportunities and let him take courses. Many of the courses were only for college graduates, but the boss allowed him to take them. He served in the company for many years and performed very well. When he decided to leave and start his own business, he said goodbye to his boss. The boss invited him to dinner to say goodbye. Later, he asked the boss, "I have a question I would like to ask you: Why do you often find money in your house?" The boss laughed and said, "When an outsider comes to stay in my house, how can I know what kind of character he has? The money was put there intentionally.” So, if someone’s character is not good, they might ruin a good opportunity. Therefore, integrity is as important as life.

**2. Do Not Spread Rumors or Gossip; Do Not Discuss Right and Wrong**

*“If you have not seen it yourself, do not speak of it lightly; if you do not know it clearly, do not spread it lightly.”*

“If you have not seen it yourself, do not speak of it lightly.” A friend of mine had heard a lot of negative things about one of his friends, but he did not spread them. Instead, he asked the friend about them in person, telling him about the rumors. Then, he asked if they were true. This allowed the person involved to explain the situation. Therefore, my friend’s method was very rational; he did not just echo what everyone else was saying. When people use reason, rumors have no chance to spread.

“If you do not know it clearly, do not spread it lightly.” If we do not understand many principles thoroughly, or if we are not clear about certain facts, we should not talk to others about them, as it will create a bias. If we speak incorrectly, we will mislead others.

*“When others speak of merits or faults, if it does not concern you, do not interfere.”*

In any group, it is inevitable that people will gossip about others. Looking at a country, in history, we often see the disasters of factional strife. In the court, there are two factions, or even more. In the end, these factions will always fight over personal grudges and end up hurting themselves. We have also noticed that when we grow up with classmates, there is always a sense of pulling. Are you on that side, or are you on our side? The wisest thing to do is not to take either side. Why do people gossip about the merits and faults of others? What is their purpose? As the saying goes, "Those who spread rumors and gossip are the ones who are causing the trouble." Therefore, "if it does not concern you, do not interfere." We should quickly distance ourselves from gossip. Those who spread rumors must have an ulterior motive. First, they want to win you over; second, they want to slander others. As long as there is gossip, it will cause harm to the group, and we should absolutely not welcome it. We should not get involved in gossip and arguments; instead, we should take the right path, treat others with kindness, and be more tolerant.

In a group, it is very important not to take either side but to remain neutral. Why? If you take a side, you will inevitably be biased. For example, when a manager does something, some people may criticize it too harshly, and some people may defend it completely. These two sides will fight to the death. At this time, we can guide them. To truly support someone, you must not always defend them. Therefore, you must continue to persuade them even if the manager doesn't listen once or twice. "Time reveals a person's heart;" they will slowly change.

On the other hand, "Do not be overly harsh when criticizing others' faults; consider their ability to bear it." When others make mistakes, don't be too strict. You need to consider how much they can take. In all honesty, because you were not involved, it is likely that if you were in the same situation, you would have made the same mistakes. Therefore, we must treat each other with tolerance. When we do not get into arguments, it acts as a restraining force on others. In a group, as long as we do not gossip and do our best to fulfill our duties without getting emotional, we can create a positive effect in the group. So, we should not underestimate the power of anyone.

**3. Do Not Hastily Agree to Unreasonable or Unlawful Requests**

*“If something is not appropriate, do not lightly agree to it; if you agree lightly, you will be trapped in a difficult situation.”*

"If something is not appropriate, do not lightly agree to it.” Lightly making promises can involve too much indulgence. Is it common to make light promises nowadays? When people are happy, they should not agree to just any request, because they may fail to do so and break their word. What adults often do is, when they are happy, children can quickly read their moods and make requests. If you agree immediately, you will regret it. When are we most likely to agree to our children’s requests? When they do well on exams. If they can get things when they do well on exams, what is the purpose of learning? They are subconsciously nurturing their vanity and distorting the purpose of education.

Why are many parents driven out of their own homes by their children? Because the children feel that you should satisfy all of their desires. So, their desires grow day by day. Desire is a deep abyss. Once a child's desires are opened up, there is no turning back. If children get used to having things, what will happen if you don't give it to them one day? We've heard of many children who will hit their mothers when they don’t get money. Then, the parents are left helpless. This is the result of lightly making promises.

There was a criminal case about a young man whose father used to give him a lot of money when he was young, so he got used to spending money. When he was in middle school, he spent ten to twenty thousand yuan a month. He was a heavy spender. One day, his father could no longer bear it and said, "I won't give you any more money." He even sent him to the army. After two years, his habits were hard to change. He still had the same vanity and extravagance. His father severed ties with him, saying that he would no longer give him money. As a result, this child hired a hitman to kill his parents.

I have tried to maintain the formal, slightly didactic tone of the original while ensuring the text flows well in English. Let me know if you need further adjustments or have any other questions!


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, natural flow, and readability:

**Therefore, we as parents must be cautious, remembering "Do not lightly promise what is improper," and avoid fostering extravagance in our children.**

"Do not lightly promise," stems from two issues: first, excessive doting, and second, a lack of principles. When parents give promises based solely on whim – granting them whenever they feel like it – they might agree, but then, when their mood changes, they may retract their offer. This erodes the child’s trust in them. For instance, you might be playing mahjong and tell your child, "Okay, if you're quiet, I’ll buy you something." From then on, when will your child ask for things? When you’re playing mahjong, or when you're busy. They will learn that it's precisely at those times that they’re guaranteed to get what they want, which becomes very problematic. Therefore, parents must avoid making casual promises, and furthermore, must teach their children not to make them either.

There was a child who gave a classmate a pencil. The classmate was delighted, sharpened it, and began to write. The next day, when the giver came, he asked the classmate, "Are you going to play with me today?" The classmate, being straightforward, said, "I’m not going to play with you today." He then said, "Then give me back that pencil." The child, still naive, gave him back the pencil. He then said, "I want the one that hasn't been sharpened." The classmate then gave him another unsharpened one. He insisted, "No, it has to be the one I originally gave you." The teacher, seizing this opportunity for a lesson, quickly intervened and said, “'Of all words, trustworthiness comes first'. You’ve already given it to someone else; it's no longer yours. You have no right to ask for it back. You must consider carefully before you give something away.” Furthermore, before you promise something to others, you must first assess if you have the ability to fulfill it. If your ability is insufficient yet you make the promise, you are bound to break your word. Besides this, you also need to consider whether what you’re promising your classmate aligns with school rules. You might agree to something that the school prohibits, which is inappropriate. Therefore, you need to consider these aspects, ensuring you adhere to school regulations and national laws.

When someone has an urgent request for your help, you must remain calm and first understand the situation clearly. Sometimes, the other person's urgency can cloud your judgment, and you might promise something only to find that the situation is not as you imagined. Therefore, even when faced with an urgent matter, it’s best to proceed cautiously. Moreover, when someone seeks your assistance, or even invites you to work together on something, you must consider: first, whether their abilities are sufficient, and second, whether your own abilities are sufficient. You need to evaluate whether all the necessary factors are in place. If they're not, and you rashly agree, you will be left in a difficult position, and misunderstandings may arise. You might have good intentions, but the situation may become hard to manage. Therefore, we should have good intentions, but also exercise rational judgment.

**4. Speak Clearly with Appropriate Tone and Rhythm**

> *When articulating words, be clear and relaxed. Avoid haste or mumbling.*

Interpersonal interaction often involves verbal communication, so is learning how to speak important? Absolutely! Have you ever learned how to speak? Probably not, which is why it's best to start training speech from a young age.

In our courses nationwide, the center's teachers often give children opportunities to speak in front of an audience, not only training their speech but also their deportment. They are taught to "walk with composure, stand upright, bow deeply, and salute respectfully." When they come up to speak, they introduce themselves, and then share an example of how they were filial to their parents at home in the past week. At this time, you will also see that sometimes their hands do not obey, moving around, and their mouths sometimes do not speak clearly. When the child's speech is unclear, what do you do? You have to give him space: “Come on, try again.” Through repeated practice, he will become proficient, and his courage and confidence will be developed.

The tone of speech should "avoid haste or mumbling". The proper attitude and method for speaking is, “Before elders, keep your voice low. But if too soft, it's not appropriate either." Therefore, the tone of voice should be appropriate, neither too loud nor too soft. Also, “When answering, look at them directly”, meaning when speaking to others, you should look them in the eye, as a sign of respect. If you put in the effort to pay attention to and train in these small details, in about three or four weeks, you will naturally follow the proper standards.

Besides letting children train their speech, we must also constantly observe our own speech in conversation. Are we speaking too fast? If we speak too quickly, others will have difficulty understanding. Many friends might say, “I’m already speaking slowly enough”. Is that sufficient? We can’t apply our own standard, but must use a standard that others can comprehend. Because the purpose of speaking is for others to understand, not just for ourselves to talk.

For example, when we are on the phone with a colleague or superior, and the other person is speaking too fast, and we don't clearly understand, yet it's something we have to handle, what should we do? We can repeat what we understood to our superior, asking, "Did you just say this and that?" By repeating what we heard, they can correct us immediately if we misunderstood. Otherwise, if there is a deviation, the superior definitely won’t think that they spoke too fast, but will blame you for being inefficient. Therefore, we should develop the habit of repeating what has been said to us before ending any phone call, to ensure that we have understood correctly. Often just a slight difference in a single word can force the entire matter to be restarted. Time is precious, and we absolutely cannot waste people’s time due to a slip of the tongue; we must be cautious with our words.

**5. See Others’ Strengths and Virtues without Jealousy and Be Determined to Learn and Emulate**

> *Upon seeing good, promptly think to emulate. Though far away, you can gradually reach it.*

“Upon seeing good, promptly think to emulate.” When we see goodness, we should actively learn from it, even offering to help. What is goodness? That which benefits others. We need a standard for goodness to properly assess things. The *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (“Di Zi Gui”) provides that. Therefore, in our daily lives, we must always adhere to the teachings of the *Di Zi Gui*.

The book *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* provides a very thorough explanation of how to determine what is good. It mentions, for example, is hitting or scolding someone good? This must be examined at its root. Goodness can be true or false, direct or indirect, visible or hidden, right or wrong, biased or correct, partial or complete, significant or small, difficult or easy. We should diligently study the principles in *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*. It will be of great assistance to ourselves and our families. The Japanese Emperor regards this book as a national treasure, showing its value for the good of a country.

Life is like a chess game, and the rules for playing the game well are found in *Liao Fan's Four Lessons*. It contains methods and theories for establishing destiny, as well as examples. When you truly understand the rules, even if you are not in a good position at the moment, your life will be well-played and full of color. That is the wisdom and skill of life. Do not pray for a good game to play, because good games tend to lead to comfort and indulgence. Therefore, the evaluation of life is based on your chess skills, or your wisdom throughout life.

The standard of good and evil is based on the following aspects: First, we judge based on true and false. *Liao Fan's Four Lessons* mentions that many scholars would ask the monk Zhong Feng, “Is hitting or scolding someone evil?” Monk Zhong Feng would reply, “Not necessarily.” Then they asked him, “Is being very respectful and polite good?” Monk Zhong Feng would also reply, “That’s not certain either.” Therefore, these scholars were confused by Monk Zhong Feng's words. These scholars, however, were humble enough to ask him for guidance. Monk Zhong Feng then said, “If he hits or scolds someone in order to awaken them, to shock them to their senses, then the motivation is to benefit others, so it is also good.” Therefore, you should only hit them if you are sure that it will wake them up; otherwise, do not hit them, as that would create resentment. Learning must be flexible, and one must act when the opportunity arises; otherwise, we may create many obstacles after only a couple of months of study.

Is being very respectful and polite toward others good? Monk Zhong Feng would reply, “If their purpose is for promotion and wealth, all for their own selfish desires, then that respect is also false, and is not good.” From Monk Zhong Feng’s teachings, we can understand that we must determine true and false goodness based on the intention. A selfish thought, even with great politeness, is still evil; but a thought that benefits the masses, even through hitting or scolding, is still good.

Second, we judge based on right and wrong. Confucius had two students, one named Zigong and the other named Zilu. Zigong was a wealthy merchant, often doing business in other countries. The law of the state of Lu stipulated that if a citizen of Lu was found sold into slavery in another country, you could use your own money to redeem them, and the state would reimburse you the same amount. Was this regulation good? It was excellent, and encouraged the people to protect their fellow citizens. Zigong happened to redeem someone, and when the government wanted to pay him back, he refused to accept the money. When this news spread, everyone thought Zigong was so noble, that he didn’t even accept the money. When this reached Confucius, he said to Zigong, “What you have done was not appropriate.” Confucius then explained to Zigong, "In our current state of Lu, the poor are the vast majority and the rich are the minority. If you do not accept reimbursement for redeeming people, when they go to other countries and see their fellow citizens, they might think that Zigong did not take the money, so if they were to take it, it would make them seem inferior to Zigong. But if they don’t take the money, they may struggle to live. Therefore, they would be hesitant to redeem them.” If even one person hesitates to redeem someone, that person represents a family, possibly with children and a wife. If even one person cannot be redeemed because of that hesitation, we would have made a mistake! Confucius told Zigong, “What you have done can cause problems in the future,” referring to negative long-term consequences. Because of this, someone might not be able to return to their own country.

One day, Zilu was walking on the road when he encountered a person who had fallen into the water and was drowning. Zilu, righteous, immediately jumped into the water and rescued him. The person who had almost drowned was very grateful, and gave Zilu his cow, saying, “I will give you this cow as thanks.” Zilu was also happy and took the cow. Generally, people would think that Zigong not accepting the money was superior, while Zilu taking the cow for doing good was inferior. However, when Confucius saw Zilu, he said to him, “What you have done is correct. In the future, more people will be willing to bravely save others when they see them in danger, because they will understand that doing good will be rewarded.” Therefore, sages look at the bigger picture, not just a singular point. Whether something is good or bad also needs to be considered based on its impact on the future. Doing something that seems good in the moment but has many harmful consequences in the future should not be done. And doing something that may not be recognized by many people at the time, but will benefit many in the future, should be done. This is how we consider what is good based on long-term consequences.

Third, we judge based on biased or correct. There was a prime minister named Lü Wenyi, and his reputation was very good, respected by the people. On his way home after retiring, he met a drunk man lying in the middle of the road, and the drunk man also insulted him. His attendants wanted to take this drunk man to the authorities. Because Lü Wenyi had a kind heart, he said, “Let’s just go around, there’s no need to lower ourselves to his level.” Later, not too long after, he received news that this drunk man had been sentenced to death. When Lü Wenyi heard this news, he realized that it was wrong to let him off. He was aware that the prime minister was coming, but he still dared to block the way; he was unrestrained and growing more arrogant, which ultimately led him to commit a crime punishable by death. Therefore, Lü Wenyi realized that if he had taken him to the authorities to be punished at the time, he may have become more careful, and would not have committed a crime punishable by death. So he had a kind heart, which was correct, but by being tolerant with this drunk man, the result was ultimately not good. This situation is called “Correct within Bias”.

Once, there was a drought, and the whole region was lacking food. Many people began to take food from the wealthy families. These wealthy people reported to the authorities, but the authorities did not take any action. One of the wealthy men was afraid of having all of his food taken, so he immediately gathered his servants and they used sticks to punish those who were looting. Thus, those who were looting became fearful and stopped their actions. In the beginning, the wealthy man was only thinking of his own food, but in the end, this also kept those who were causing chaos from continuing to do so. This is called “Bias within Correct.” He wasn’t thinking of the public, but in the end, it impacted the community positively, thus it was a “bias within correct”. Therefore, goodness can be biased or correct.

Fourth, we judge based on partial or complete. A woman donated her last two coins. The abbot himself performed a repentance for her. Later, when she became wealthy and noble after entering the palace, she donated a few thousand taels. However, the abbot only sent a disciple to conduct a dedication ceremony. This is because before, when she donated the two coins, it was done with a sincere heart, it was a complete act of goodness. Later, she was only donating a small portion of her wealth, and her heart was not as sincere as it was before, so this was a partial good deed. I have also read in a report about an elderly couple from the countryside who donated all of their life savings to purchase an ambulance for rescuing people, so this elderly couple has achieved “complete goodness,” with all of their heart.

Fifth, we judge based on significant or small. Once, when Wei Zhongda was sleeping, he was taken to the underworld by the judge. The judge said, “Come, bring out his good and bad deeds, and weigh them to see which is heavier and which is lighter.” When Wei Zhongda’s bad deeds were brought out, they could have almost filled a whole room, but his good deeds were only a scroll, as small as a chopstick. So Wei Zhongda was surprised. He asked, "I'm not even forty years old yet, why do I have so many bad deeds?" The judge then told him, “As long as you have a thought, whether good or bad, it will be recorded. Even if you haven’t done it, if you often have bad thoughts, you will accumulate this much.”

Wei Zhongda’s good deeds were only a scroll, but when put on the scale, they were heavier than the mountain of bad deeds. Wei Zhongda was also surprised and asked, "What exactly is in this scroll of good deeds?" When it was opened, it was revealed to be his memorial to the emperor, advising him not to build the Three Mountains Bridge because it would waste the peoples' resources and labor. Wei Zhongda said, "The emperor did not accept my suggestion, why is this considered a good deed?" The judge said, "This thought was for the sake of countless people, so this act of good is very significant." The magnitude of the good is determined by the intentions of our hearts. When we understand how to judge good, we can then "upon seeing good, promptly think to emulate, and though far away, we can gradually reach it." Moreover, when we practice good, we must always remember, “Do not yield in doing good, even to your teacher.” Practicing good also means not falling behind. There is a saying, “Not yielding to the ancients is having ambition”. This means, when we study and learn from the ancients, we must have the ambition to not lose to them, and even surpass them. This is not arrogance. Consider this: if you are a parent, and your son says to you, “Dad, I will never be able to surpass you in this lifetime,” would you be happy? You would say, “When I was your age, I knew nothing. Now I have told you all my experiences, and you still say that you won’t surpass me?” The father would certainly be sad. If every person who studies the teachings of the sages says, “Those are sages, we can’t achieve that level,” our ancestors would say they are beyond redemption. Therefore, we must have aspiration and determination in learning; we must "not yield to the ancients."

**6. When We See Shortcomings in Our Classmates, We Should Reflect on Whether We Also Have These Problems and Work Hard to Improve**

> *Upon seeing evil in others, reflect inwardly. If you have it, correct it. If not, remain vigilant.*

When we see shortcomings in others, instead of immediately criticizing them, we should first look within to see if we have made the same mistake. If we have, we should quickly correct it; if we don’t, we should remain mindful. Teacher Li Bingnan had a great saying: “When you see good in others, do not be jealous, be joyful. When you see evil in others, do not criticize, offer advice or remain silent. When you see others doing wrong, do not blame them, help them.” The elderly's words are filled with wisdom. If we always use them to reflect on our own hearts, we will progress quickly.

“Upon seeing evil”, we must absolutely not keep it in our hearts, otherwise our purest heart will be filled with other people's garbage, which is extremely foolish. A friend once said, "It is very difficult to not see the bad in others." He asked Professor Jingkong for guidance, and the master taught him a good method: "When you see a mistake in others, say to yourself, ‘It’s all my fault.’” For example, when you see your son being disobedient, say, “It’s all my fault, I didn’t teach him well.” Then, hurry to teach him! If you see your wife not behaving well, say, “It’s all my fault, I did not use my virtue to move her, it is also my fault.” If you see someone on the street acting without virtue, say, “It’s all my fault, I did not set an example to influence him.” When a person always focuses on their own responsibilities, they won’t waste time criticizing others. This method, I believe, is very helpful and beneficial. This is how we can, “When we see evil in others, we should reflect inwardly, and if we have it, we should correct it. If not, remain vigilant.”

Correcting faults is also a very important skill. *Liao Fan’s Four Lessons* discusses “Before talking about doing good deeds, you must first correct your faults.” If we do not correct our mistakes, then today, even if we practice good, if we equate doing good with water, it would be like adding water into a bucket with many holes, because we have not corrected our bad habits, no matter how much we add, the water will leak out. Therefore, we must first patch the holes. Then our future good deeds will accumulate more abundantly.

To correct faults, we must give rise to three intentions: First, a sense of shame; second, a sense of fear; and third, a sense of courage. Why must we have a sense of shame? Everyone has great potential and should develop themselves to become a sage or a virtuous person. Therefore, Mencius encouraged us, “What was Shun, and what am I? He who strives is like him.” We have such a rare human body, we must utilize it well, and not disappoint our ancestors, and must become a master of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. How do we become masters of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity? That means we must perform the virtue of Heaven and Earth. What virtue does the Earth have? To nurture all things. To make all things reach their potential. Therefore, it has a broad and equal mind. Look at how we give the most filthy things to the Earth, and the Earth transforms it into nutrients and gives them back to us. Like a mother, even if we soil her, she gives back to us with selfless dedication. Therefore, "the Earth is the mother, Heaven is the father". We must perform the virtues of Heaven and Earth well through our lives.

The ancient sages could become virtuous and wise. We must absolutely not live a life without contribution. If we even become a burden on our family and society, then that would be too shameful. Therefore, Mencius said, “The sense of shame is most important to man.” The sense of shame is crucial for people. With a sense of shame, we can become a sage. Without a sense of shame, we will live worse than animals. Therefore, a sense of shame is very important for our self-improvement.

Second, give rise to “a sense of fear.” As the saying goes, “There are spirits three feet above your head,” and “If you don’t want others to know, you shouldn’t do it.” We often feel like we’re able to hide things well, but we’re only deceiving ourselves. “Time will tell,” when others see through us, we become worthless. Therefore, it’s never too late to correct our mistakes. In ancient times, there was someone who did evil throughout his life, but in his final moments, repented for all of his actions, and still had a good ending. Therefore, even if we have committed great sins, we must repent. The saying goes, "Even sins that touch the sky can't compare to one act of repentance". It is important to know how to repent and correct our faults. Therefore, “The past is dead, like yesterday; the future is alive, like today.” We must make the determination to be good students of the sages from this day forward. We can believe that no matter what mistakes we have made in the past, we can make up for them and gain the respect of others.

“Life is impermanent,” therefore, we must not wait to correct our faults. If we wait until our life ends, we will not be able to change. A lifetime of evil reputation might even disgrace our descendants. Like Qin Hui, people have been spitting on him for almost a thousand years. No one has ever dared to say, “I am a descendant of Qin Hui.” Therefore, we cannot do things that will bring shame to our descendants; we must have a sense of fear.

Third, have “a sense of courage”. We must have the courage to face our bad habits. I remember when Uncle Lu talked to me for the first time; we spoke for two hours, and there was one sentence that stuck with me the most: he said that you must be absolutely ruthless with yourself, but generous with others. In fact, this has the same meaning as what the sages always taught: “Be strict with yourself, and lenient with others.” But the words that Uncle Lu used made a deep impression on me. Therefore, when I encounter bad habits, I must act decisively and resolutely, and must never retreat.

Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English. I've aimed for accuracy, natural flow, and a tone suitable for a book or essay. I've also retained cultural references where appropriate, as they are crucial to the text's meaning.

**Translation:**

This reminds me of a historical story. During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhao Zilong (also known as Zhao Yun) rescued A Dou, carrying him in his arms while surrounded by hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers. At that time, he had only one thought: to break through and protect A Dou. Therefore, we must enhance our knowledge and possess Zhao Zilong’s spirit. Our past worries and habits are like hundreds of thousands of soldiers surging towards us. At this moment, we cannot have any intention of retreating, because hesitation will cause us to regress. Instead of advancing five steps, we will retreat dozens of steps, and we will become very discouraged! So, we must not have the thought of retreating but believe that we can surely rescue A Dou. Who is A Dou? He is a metaphor for our inherently good heart. We must protect our inherently good heart and have the courage to allow it to truly shine forth; we cannot retreat.

In *Liaofan’s Four Lessons* it is also mentioned that we should treat bad habits as if they were a venomous snake biting our finger. If a venomous snake bites our finger, any hesitation or contemplation will mean certain death. We must immediately use our sword to cut it off. This is to eliminate it completely. We cannot allow bad habits to remain even for half a second. As soon as a thought arises, we should immediately use scripture to transform it. For example, if we are about to get angry, we should immediately think of “anger leads to difficulty” and that "patient speech eliminates anger.”

“When you see someone's faults, immediately reflect within. If you have them, correct them; if not, take them as a warning.” This is the courage and method for correcting faults. Correcting faults can be divided into three aspects: one, correcting at the level of action; two, correcting at the level of principle; and three, correcting at the level of the heart. It’s like a poisonous tree; correcting from the heart is to cut off its roots. It is like severing the roots and correcting from the very source. Therefore, someone who truly understands cultivation of the mind can constantly observe their own arising thoughts. When they can see the biases of their own arising thoughts, they will immediately correct them, making it impossible to have biased speech and actions. This is true correction.

7. People should value their own virtue and talent. Do not be inferior or worried if your appearance and clothes are not as good as others.

*Only in virtue and learning, only in talent and skills, if you are not as good as others, you should strive to improve.*

If parents place virtue first, they can establish correct life values for their children. "If clothing and food are not as good as others, do not become upset." Do not treat life as merely the endless pursuit of material pleasure. If parents prioritize “money,” the children they raise will also value profit over righteousness.

If we truly obtain all the material enjoyment of food, clothes, and even housing, will our lives truly become better? If a person spends their life pursuing material things and is indeed happy, then I have no objection, and I would support and encourage them to continue. But this is not the case. Those who truly pursue material things are very empty inside. They constantly compare themselves to others. When they see someone buy a new car, they feel extremely miserable inside. This is called creating your own troubles and bringing suffering upon yourself. Therefore, I tell them: How long will you be happy after buying expensive clothes? Three days of happiness. When you swipe your card, you've used half a month's salary, causing you a month of suffering. After you buy it, you wear it to work and ask your colleagues, "Do you think there's something different about me today?" If you encounter someone who is clueless and says, "Is there?" you'll be so angry. You spent so much money and they didn’t even notice. Then there's no happiness! There’s also the suffering of worrying about whether others notice you. Such happiness is false, only lasting for a brief moment, followed by suffering. The joy that people seek is illusory and unreal.

What kind of joy can make people truly happy, fulfilled, and emanate from within? It is doing good. Doing good is the greatest joy. Also, "to learn and at due times to practice what one has learnt, is this not a pleasure?" The joy of growth will accompany you throughout your life, bringing boundless Dharma joy.

*“Only in virtue and learning, only in talent and skills, if you are not as good as others, you should strive to improve."* There is a Chinese idiom, “virtue and talent combined,” with virtue placed first and talent second. Virtue is more important than talent. In modern times, there was a calligrapher revered as the “Sage of Cursive Script” of his time, Mr. Lin Sanzhi. The Japanese highly respected his calligraphy. Japanese calligraphers admired his calligraphy and character. Whenever they came to China, they would visit his home to pay their respects. Mr. Lin Sanzhi once said, “One who has virtue and talent loves talent, one who has talent without virtue envies talent, one who has virtue without talent uses talent, and one who has neither virtue nor talent destroys talent.” Therefore, when we hire employees, we must choose those with both virtue and talent. At the very least, we should choose those with virtue but no talent. Because someone with virtue knows how to be tolerant and will appreciate the talent of others. They understand that "when you see someone good, you should think about emulating them," and therefore know how to cherish talent.

If someone has talent without virtue, they will inevitably become envious of others. If they lack even talent, they will destroy talent. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was a prime minister in the Qin state named Li Si. He had talent but no virtue, so he was jealous of talented people. He was jealous of his junior fellow disciple, Han Feizi, and even framed him to death. Not only did he frame Han Feizi, but he also framed scholars. He suggested that Qin Shi Huang burn books and bury scholars alive, burning the teachings of many sages of the past. This sin was too great. Later, Li Si did not have a good ending either. Both he and his son were sentenced to be cut in half at the waist in the public marketplace. This is what happens when one has talent without virtue and becomes envious of talent. Therefore, we must prioritize moral character when raising children. If we do not prioritize moral character, no matter how much we develop our children's talents, their lives will never be happy. Because being jealous of others will surely bring suffering, and it will create many obstacles in their lives. Others will also be jealous of them. This is a situation we must be wary of.

I know a calligrapher named Li Chuanjun. Teacher Li once served as a calligraphy judge and found that some of the students' works were definitely done by teachers. When parents and teachers engage in such behavior, they are not educating children but misleading them. It makes children think that they can achieve their goals by any means, regardless of rules. This plants a very negative seed in the children's minds, and they may break rules and laws in the future, leading to their ruin. Therefore, “virtue” is the foundation of a person’s life and career. It is very dangerous if the foundation is not solid. It is like a big tree. If its roots are not solid, the taller its trunk grows and the larger its shade becomes, it will be uprooted sooner or later by a gust of wind. This situation is very common. Therefore, a person's wrongdoings are usually done at the height of their success. Someone without virtue will do many wrong things when they become successful. Later, Teacher Li insisted on excluding the works that were done by teachers, allowing children who wrote their own works to be truly recognized.

This Teacher Li also told me that he had searched for many calligraphy teachers and spent a lot of money to learn from them, but he didn’t learn the real skills. After a long and costly detour, he was impoverished. Because he had a sense of mission to pass on Chinese art, providence didn't fail those who had the will and the determination, and he finally met his calligraphy teacher. His calligraphy teacher not only didn't charge him, but he also allowed him to live at his home and study with him. So, my friends, to let your children learn true skills, it is definitely not about spending a lot of money. If these artists are all asking you for so much money, does it reveal whether they have more virtue or just talent? When a person has talent without virtue, their talent and artistic level will certainly encounter a bottleneck and not improve because art is also a reflection of one’s character. The reason why many works of art are deeply moving is because they are directly related to the artist’s state of mind, compassion, and cultivation.

Teacher Li’s calligraphy teacher taught him many essential heart-mind techniques, and after teaching him, he said to him, "If you don’t have true virtue, if I teach you these talents, I’m harming you for life." He also said, "Because these talents that I am passing on to you may lead to fame and fortune in a short period of time, and this is when danger will appear in your life. If you do not know humility at this time, you will attract a lot of jealousy. If you do not know how to be frugal and economical in your life, you may develop extravagant habits.” Therefore, we see that many people in the arts once became very popular, but many also become very impoverished in their later years. That’s because they developed extravagant habits. Teacher Li understood the words of his mentor very deeply, so he humbly followed his teachings. He had received several major awards by the time he was thirty-three years old, and he also often taught voluntarily. I once invited him to Haikou to help us guide calligraphy. He didn’t charge anything, and even brought a lot of pens to give to the teachers in Haikou. Therefore, virtue is important. Virtue is the foundation of all blessings. With this virtue, blessings can be established securely.

Laozi once met an official who asked him, "I have two sons, and I don't know which one I should rely on in the future." Laozi put some money on the table and said to his eldest son, "If you just hit your father, all this money is yours." The eldest son was more honest and lowered his head, saying, "No, how can I hit my father?" He would rather die than do it. Then Laozi said to his youngest son (the youngest son was clever and quick-witted, and most parents would think the youngest son was better), "If you just lightly hit me, all this money is yours." The youngest son immediately went over and hit him and quickly put the money in his pocket. Laozi said to him, "Now you know who you should rely on in your old age."

Later, it was indeed the eldest son who took care of the official in his old age. The youngest son went to other places to do business. When the news of his father's death reached the youngest son's ears, he said, "It will take me a while to travel back and forth, I don't know how much money I will lose.” Later, he did not even attend his father's funeral. Laozi was very wise. He could infer someone’s intention from their actions, because "those who value profit must disregard righteousness." As long as there is a conflict with their interests, they will always put profit first. So, while people are fond of clever young children, it is often the more honest children who take care of them in their old age.

We have heard of a mother who gave birth to three children. The eldest and second child graduated from university, and the third child graduated from high school. As a result, the more educated sons became more selfish and only cared about themselves. Many parents send their children to study abroad, and in the end, they never return to their homeland and don’t take care of their parents in their old age. Some get married there, and their parents even have to travel a long way to visit them. Even after staying for some time and about to leave, the daughter-in-law will present a bill to her parents-in-law. Parents will feel extremely disheartened, and wonder if it would have been better not to have had them in the first place. So, if children do not grow in virtue, they will truly make their parents miserable and bring harm to their families and society. Therefore, when educating children, we must have a long-term view and focus on virtue as the foundation.

*If clothing and food are not as good as others, do not become upset.*

The current social atmosphere is quite superficial, with people emphasizing material enjoyment. Many people might be very poor and barely have enough to eat, but they insist on buying very beautiful clothes to show off to others. Perhaps their wives and children are starving at home, but they still try to put on a brave face. This kind of attitude is too hypocritical.

If a person truly respects you from their heart, it's definitely not because you have money in your pocket. When you have a lot of money, they will be very polite to you. But who are they really being polite to? They are being polite to the money. As soon as all the money in your pocket is given to them, their attitude will immediately change. Therefore, it is said that “the friendship of gentlemen is as light as water, while the friendship of petty people is as sweet as honey.” Why is the friendship of petty people as sweet as honey? Because they have an ulterior motive, so they will do everything they can to fawn over you, and flatter you. Many people, in this kind of situation, think that these people are treating them with great respect, but they may end up falling into the trap of petty people. Why is the friendship of gentlemen as light as water? Because gentlemen interact with friends based on virtue, there is genuine depth and truth within their simple interactions. They would not be glued to your side all day because they are very clear that they have the responsibilities of being a son, a subject, a husband, and a wife. They each have many duties that they should do their best to fulfill. How could they possibly spend all day hanging out with you? They would definitely say, "It's already past eight o'clock, aren't you supposed to go back home and tell your son a story about moral education? Hurry home." This “depth and truth within simplicity” contains mutual care and consideration.

The abundance of material things does not win the respect of others. In fact, in pursuit of material things, you may fall into a bottomless abyss, becoming a slave to material possessions for your entire life and dragging your family down with you.

Many people feel that they need to buy a luxurious villa to appear important. Our ancestors reminded us: “With thousands of riches, you eat three meals a day, and with a thousand mansions, you sleep in six feet.” A person’s needs for material things are very little, so why bother pursuing vain and superficial things? As the saying goes, if you are content, you will always be happy. Life becomes very easy and simple, which is good for your physical and mental health.

8. If you love hearing praise and hate hearing criticism, it will be very difficult to make true friends and find good teachers.

*If you become angry when you hear criticism, and happy when you hear praise, bad friends will come, while good friends will leave.*

If we get angry when others point out our faults, and become overjoyed when praised, this kind of attitude will not gain the trust of friends, and will cause “bad friends to come, while good friends will leave.” Why do bad friends come? Because they know very well that as long as they give you a few compliments, you will lose your mind, and they will have an opportunity to take advantage of you. When bad friends come, good friends will retreat. Why will good friends retreat? Because those with virtue know that as friends, it is their duty to speak honestly, and if you have faults, they will surely point them out to you directly. When you cannot accept this, they will have to leave for a while, so as not to upset you. Only when you are willing to accept their advice and correction will they return to your side.

Do people prefer hearing praise or honest words? They prefer hearing praise. When does this habit begin? Therefore, the attitude of “being fearful of praise and joyful with criticism” must be established from a young age. When our teachers teach this, they always remind the children: "Today, if someone points out your shortcomings, it’s like having something black on your face. If someone tells you about it so you can remove the dirt, should you thank them?" "Of course, I should." Therefore, among the children, whenever a classmate points out another's faults, you will hear a beautiful sentence. They will bow to their classmate and say, "Thank you for pointing out my shortcomings." When children make changes to their shortcomings, our teachers would encourage them in a timely manner, saying "If you can correct your faults, it is as though you no longer have those faults.” Then, they would be even more joyful to correct those shortcomings. Therefore, establishing the habit of correcting faults from childhood will benefit them greatly throughout their lives.

There was a great writer of the Song Dynasty named Su Dongpo, and he and Buddhist Master Foyin were good friends who often discussed and learned from each other. One day, Su Dongpo felt that his state of mind was very good, so he wrote a poem: “I bow my head to the heaven outside of heaven, whose brilliant light shines on the great world. The eight winds cannot move me, sitting firmly on the golden lotus throne.” He felt that even the eight winds could not affect his pure mind. The eight winds are tests of our state of mind: gain, loss, suffering, joy, praise, ridicule, slander, and reputation. "Gain" refers to when things are smooth and prosperous for you; "loss" is when things decline and you suffer setbacks; then there is "suffering," or when one is experiencing pain; or "joy," when you are very happy. Often, when people suffer, they complain, and when they are joyful, it is possible to become overly joyful. These states are all tests of one's character. Then there is "praise," when one might become conceited. “Ridicule” is when others ridicule and defame us, which can make us angry and uncomfortable. Also, there are “slander and praise.” “Slander” is when one is maligned and defamed; "praise" is when one receives good reputation and might become arrogant. So Su Dongpo felt that these eight winds could not affect the purity of his mind, so he wrote this poem and had his book boy deliver it to Master Foyin. When Master Foyin finished reading it, he wrote the character "屁 (Pì)" meaning "fart" on the letter and sent it back. Su Dongpo expected praise from Foyin and wanted to hear pleasant words, and so he was already being swayed by the eight winds. When he saw the character, he became very angry, and rushed to the place where Foyin lived. When he arrived at the door, it was closed, and on the door were written the lines: "The eight winds could not move him, but one fart blew him across the river." When Su Dongpo saw this, he became very ashamed and left. Therefore, we must constantly observe whether we are moved by the eight winds and constantly remove our bad habits starting from our arising thoughts, so we don’t make the mistake of “becoming angry when hearing criticism and happy when hearing praise.”

*If you are fearful of praise and happy with criticism, honest and upright people will naturally become close to you.*

People hear too much praise, so when they hear criticism, they feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, one should constantly reflect on this verse from *Di Zi Gui* (Standards for Being a Good Student and Child): “If you are fearful of praise and happy with criticism, honest and upright people will naturally become close to you.” We only have two eyes and two ears. How much can we see? How much can we hear? When we have a humble heart, we don’t know how many more pairs of eyes are helping us see the road, how many more pairs of ears are helping us hear important information and helping us correct our many shortcomings. So, children must cultivate humility, not complacency.

When a ruler is magnanimous and accepts the suggestions of his ministers, it will inevitably encourage these loyal ministers and virtuous officials to point out his shortcomings, so that his policies can truly benefit the people. Similarly, as parents and teachers, when students or children point out our shortcomings, we must also humbly accept them and admit our mistakes to our children. Many elders will think: “If I do this, I would seem to have lowered myself.” Actually, it is quite the opposite. When our teachers make mistakes, for example, violate one of the verses of the *Di Zi Gui*, we should immediately say to the students, "The teacher made a mistake here and needs to correct it. The teacher is learning with you." Often when teachers admit mistakes, what do the children see? They see respect for their teachers. The ability to admit mistakes is a virtue. “No one is a sage or a wise man; who can be free from mistakes? If you can correct your faults, it is the greatest of good deeds.” Therefore, when elders take the initiative to correct their mistakes, it will also encourage the entire group to bravely admit their mistakes.

When we have the humility to accept the advice of others, we will naturally receive help from many people. The ancient Chinese used plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums to represent the virtues of a gentleman. Why does bamboo represent the virtues of a gentleman? Because the heart of the bamboo is empty, constantly making space to receive elegant and truthful words. Our ancestors not only learned from people, but they also learned from all things in nature. When they saw the virtue of all things, they would also reflect on themselves and correct themselves. Therefore, we should be skillful in our studies. What is important is that people have the ability to understand. With understanding, you can draw inferences from one instance, and when in contact with all people and things, you can cultivate and improve yourself.

I once asked the students: What kind of virtues does bamboo have? What can we learn from it? I let them make their own observations. In addition to humility, what else? We can see that bamboo grows in clusters. Because they grow in clusters, each stalk grows upright, just like when you are surrounded by upright people, I believe you won't be able to go astray. This shows the importance of the environment. This is why Mencius’ mother moved three times. Even though Mencius had great potential and good qualities, he still needed a good environment to nurture him. Therefore, parents should provide their children with a good learning environment.

When we look at bamboo more closely, we can see that it grows taller, section by section, representing that life is not always smooth, and you will certainly encounter challenges. When facing challenges, you must bravely move forward to overcome them. Bamboo must break through each section, and must have a persevering attitude to face life. Students often give answers that surprise us. One student said, “Teacher, bamboo has a spirit of serving people.” I said, “Why do you say that?” He said, “Because bamboo shoots can be eaten, bamboo can be used to build houses, and bamboo leaves can be used to wrap zongzi (bamboo wrapped rice dumplings). It gives everything it has to offer.” When we hear this, we also feel very ashamed. Are we as selfless as bamboo? We can approach people, events, and things around us with humility, accept their advice, and learn from them. This will greatly benefit our lives.

"Fear praise." Why should we take a cautious attitude when we hear praise? It’s because our talents and achievements are definitely not something that we achieve through our personal abilities alone.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided text from Chinese to English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural flow:

**Book Translation:**

We owe our growth to the nurturing and education of our parents, as well as the guidance and care of many elders, which have enabled us to develop our abilities. When we achieve something, we must first and foremost remember that our accomplishments are due to their efforts. This prevents us from becoming arrogant and conceited. With this mindset, we won’t be overjoyed by praise, but rather feel a sense of humble trepidation. We’ll strive to fulfill our roles to the best of our ability to repay the sacrifices made by others.

**9. Be Courageous in Correcting Mistakes; Avoidance, Lies, and Cover-Ups Compound Errors**

*Unintentional wrongdoing is called a mistake; intentional wrongdoing is called evil.*

"Unintentional wrongdoing is called a mistake," which is akin to "ignorance is bliss." When others make mistakes unintentionally, we should be understanding and forgiving, or they will feel very uncomfortable. For ourselves, we must constantly examine our own speech and behavior to see if we have acted improperly. For example, when calling a friend who may be about to leave, if you launch into a long conversation, they may not know how to interrupt, and as a result, they will just listen. This too, is unintentional wrongdoing. Therefore, before making a call, we must first ask, "Is this a convenient time for you?" We should always be considerate of others.

Confucius "asked about everything upon entering the Great Temple." Whenever he arrived at a new place, he would inquire about many things from the staff at the local Great Temple. His students were puzzled. Why would a scholar as learned as Confucius ask about everything at the Great Temple? His students questioned him. Confucius replied, "Asking about everything shows respect for the matter, and when we enter a new environment, there may be rules that we are unaware of. We should not act according to our own whims, or we might be impolite." Thus, when we arrive at a new environment, we should first understand their routines and even how their belongings are arranged. We cannot alter or change things arbitrarily. Sometimes, even with good intentions, we may cause trouble for the local staff, and this could be a case of "unintentional wrongdoing is called a mistake."

“Intentional wrongdoing is called evil,” meaning “knowing full well but doing it anyway.” This is evil and unacceptable. Is this phenomenon common today? For example, even though it says “no smoking,” people still smoke heavily in those areas. Even though signs near the river say “no fishing,” people still fish. Or, despite signs that say “no littering,” people still litter there. What is the reason for this? It’s because they haven't studied the *Standards for Students*, they lack education. They have not properly learned the principles of how to conduct themselves as human beings, lacking both teachers and parental reminders. Thus, it's "ancestors not virtuous; descendants ignorant of morality". This is a societal trend. Who is responsible for this trend? Every member of society is responsible. If an entire society lacks a sense of justice and no one points out the mistakes of others, it creates space for wrongdoers to become more and more arrogant, which is like tolerating evil. If we see someone cutting in line, we should try to correct them. Of course, in our correction, we must be “pleasant in countenance and gentle in voice”. As *Standards for Students* says, “When relatives err,” - and “relatives” here includes not only parents and family, but all people as "all within the four seas are brothers.” All members of society are our compatriots. We have a responsibility to advise them, but we must do so with an appropriate attitude to avoid conflict.

Why do people do things that are clearly wrong? In their hearts, they say that everyone else does it. This is just making excuses, but it's not entirely without reason because there are too few good role models, and it makes them feel that committing errors is normal. Therefore, we must have a sense of mission. We must act as role models to correct the wrongdoings in society. For example, if people today do not understand gratitude, we should show them a good example of being thankful. If people in society are rude, we should demonstrate exceptional politeness so they will feel remorse.

Nowadays, many people take public resources for their own use. In reality, taking public resources is like owing a debt to the entire community, and this debt is very difficult to repay. It is a petty person who acts pettily. We must pity them for not understanding the principle of "even small things, do not keep for yourself”. We must be honest in companies and organizations. We must absolutely refrain from taking even a single cent from public resources. When you act in this way, it has a restraining effect on the entire group. When people see you, they will naturally behave themselves. Therefore, friends, do not underestimate your influence at home and at work. As long as someone models the correct behavior, others around them won’t dare to act too brazenly. We must genuinely be good role models.

“Intentional wrongdoing is called evil.” Many people know they are doing wrong, but they cannot control their temper and act on it anyway. Therefore, we need to find ways to remedy the situation.

We should not ask others to do it first. It is most important for us to do it ourselves first. I often meet people who come to a lecture for the first time and say: “My friend needs to hear this most,” or, “My son needs to hear this most.” No one says they themselves need to hear it most. They focus on others’ mistakes, and what others should learn. But they have not turned their attention back to themselves, and their own progress will be slow. Thus, the first step in transforming one's life should be to start with oneself.

*A fault corrected vanishes; if concealed, an error multiplies.*

Correcting mistakes is truly important for one's entire life. As the saying goes, "no one is perfect, who can be without fault?" In thousands of years of history, it’s impossible to find someone who has never made a mistake from birth to death. It's equally impossible to find a person who only commits evil. People have both good and bad in them. If we understand how to advise others and know how to correct our own mistakes, we can "increase virtue daily and diminish our faults." When we advise others, we must not only have a sincere and compassionate heart but also use skillful methods.

Confucius gave us three great treasures for self-cultivation. First, "to be fond of learning is close to wisdom." We must constantly strive to improve our learning because, in learning, it's like rowing upstream: if you don't go forward, you will fall back. Second, “diligent practice is close to benevolence.” Only by truly implementing the teachings of the sages can we continuously increase our benevolence, continuously see the needs of children, family, and society, and see our own duties. Third, "to have a sense of shame is close to courage." Does lifting a few hundred kilograms make you a brave person? No, that's physical strength, not intellectual courage of character. The truly courageous person is the one who can conquer their own bad habits and tendencies. What is a true hero? The saying goes, "To defeat others a thousand times is not as good as defeating oneself once." The true brave person is the one who can address their bad habits and correct them. Therefore, to have a sense of shame is close to courage. When this courage persists for two or three years, your habits will slowly change, and the rest of your life will be filled with joy and fulfillment.

During the Spring and Autumn period, there was a virtuous prime minister named Yan Ying who had great virtue. He wore the same coat for thirty years, yet it still looked neat and tidy because "those who cherish things, things will always cherish them." When a prime minister wears the same coat for thirty years, it not only influences his family but also influences the entire civil and military officials, as well as the common people. Yan Ying's integrity led to an honest and incorruptible social atmosphere.

Yan Ying's coachman drove him to work every day. Because he was driving for the prime minister, the coachman became arrogant, and the idiom for this is "putting on airs due to another’s influence." His wife noticed this, and one day, she told him, "I'm leaving you." The coachman was alarmed and asked, "Why do you want to leave me?" She said, "People respect Yan Ying's virtue. You don't have Yan Ying’s virtue, and yet Yan Ying is so humble. People who have virtue are humble, and you who lack virtue are so arrogant, so I don't want to rely on you. I'm leaving." The coachman was ashamed after hearing this and said to his wife, "I will change. Please don't leave."

His wife had good insight. She knew to advise and correct her husband. Of course, her husband was also big-hearted enough to accept her advice. It is said that if you listen to your wife's advice, especially if it’s correct advice, you will become very wealthy. Later, this coachman resolved to change and started studying diligently. Yan Ying noticed how quickly his character improved, so he recommended the coachman to become a high official in the state of Qi. Therefore, as long as a person is willing to correct their mistakes, they will have a bright future. “A prodigal son who returns is more precious than gold.”

We have a friend on the mainland whom we call "More Precious Than Gold," a prodigal son who returned, and therefore is more precious than gold. Why do we call him that? Because when we taught a class in Shanghai, he drove all night from Shandong to Shanghai to attend. His older sister had attended the course in Lujiang, Anhui, and as soon as we were scheduled to teach in Shanghai, she called him, saying, "Even if you can make a lot of money these next few days, you have to drop everything and come to Shanghai to attend the class." Her younger brother heard this and immediately dropped all his work to travel to where we were teaching. As he listened to the lectures, he had one consistent expression: staring intently, with his mouth open. All the teachers noticed this man sitting there, wondering who he was. After several days of class, before he was about to leave, he asked, "Could I have ten minutes to talk with Teacher Cai?" Our staff, seeing how sincere he was, arranged for me to speak with him briefly. He was very emotional and said, "Teacher Cai, I haven't just listened to your lectures with my ears, but with my entire life experience."

In my lecture, I mentioned the *Book of Changes*, that "a family that accumulates good will have abundant blessings." He said this is completely true. Because when he was young, his temper was terrible. He had many bad habits, and he had even taken a knife to go and attack someone. He was walking down the street, full of aggression, but fortunately his father's good friend saw him and forcibly pulled him back, preventing him from doing something that he could never have undone for the rest of his life. Why was his father’s friend willing to do this? Because his father worked in telecommunications, often working hard in the middle of the night, and even in the rain, having a good reputation in the village, and everyone respected him. Due to his father’s virtue, he was saved from that disaster. And on several occasions, it was his father's virtue that allowed him to turn misfortune into good fortune.

Later, he became addicted to drugs, and it was very difficult to quit. But because he was still very filial to his mother, his motivation for trying to quit drugs was his feeling of guilt toward his mother. If he did not quit, he didn’t know how much longer his mother would have to suffer. Therefore, the motivation for a person to change can come from filial piety, family, and love. If we see someone around us who is struggling, we should also be sincere in encouraging and caring for them. The main reason why he was able to attend the course was that he also had respect for his older sister. He said that his sister had never spoken to him in that tone before. He had never heard his sister say, “You must go immediately, you absolutely must go.” So, he knew that his sister must be doing it for his own good and she must know this was important.

He also mentioned that when he was in his teens, he went to do business and became very successful, making a lot of money. At nineteen years old, he had a cell phone and was very proud of it. When he went home, everyone said, "You are so amazing, so good at making money." Everyone admired him and elevated him to a position of importance. Friends, is this correct? Should people be respected just because they make a lot of money? Making money is due to opportunities. Spending money requires wisdom. If a person doesn't have wisdom and virtue, then making money will trigger life crises. Because with money, he picks up many bad habits and does dangerous things, which then come at a great cost.

After listening to the class, he was very emotional. He said that if he had had the opportunity to learn the teachings of our ancestors and sages when he was in his teens, his life would never have been so difficult. From this statement, we can see that he was not resistant to being taught, but rather that he didn’t have the opportunity. Indeed, the way he listened to the class during those few days showed that he was very earnest and diligent. Later, when we went to his hometown to hold classes, he and his wife drove overnight to attend. This was the correct thing to do because a family should not have only one person growing; they should grow together. He said to me, "Teacher Cai, you can't just give lectures to these people. They are already good people. Our kind of people need it even more." I told him that once he settled things at his company, he could go with me to prisons and other places where people don’t have the opportunity to receive good education to teach. Because he had been through what these people had, what he said could resonate with them, and they would be able to feel the impact. In this way, we can guide him, but the most important thing is that his learning has a goal, and this will drive his growth. This is the story of "More Precious Than Gold."

Correcting mistakes not only impacts an individual but also a family and even an entire nation. During the Spring and Autumn Period, there was a famous prime minister named Lin Xiangru. We all know the story of "Returning the Jade Intact." Lin Xiangru was very resourceful and was able to resolve that crisis. Because of his outstanding performance, the King of Zhao gave him the highest official title. But there was a general in Zhao named Lian Po, who was an old warhorse, having achieved great military victories for Zhao. This general looked down on Lin Xiangru, thinking Lin Xiangru relied only on his words, while he had risked his life on the battlefield, so he was very resentful. Often on the road, Lian Po would purposely try to bump into Lin Xiangru’s carriage to cause trouble. Whenever Lin Xiangru saw the general's carriage coming, he would take a detour to avoid any conflict. Sometimes, Lian Po would go to Lin Xiangru's place, and Lin Xiangru would claim to be unwell, refusing to meet with him, handling everything in a low-key manner.

Lin Xiangru’s family was unhappy and said to him, “Sir, why are you so weak? Why are you being so submissive?” Lin Xiangru said to his family, “Why doesn't a large country like Qin dare to attack our Zhao? It's because the State of Zhao has General Lian Po and me, which makes Qin unwilling to act rashly. My personal humiliation is a small matter, but if I were to conflict with General Lian Po, and cause the country to be in danger, that would be a disgrace to our nation, which I could never face our country or history. Therefore, I should bear the humiliation and burdens." These words later reached the ears of General Lian Po. Although the old general was quick to anger, he was also a reasonable man. After hearing this, he was very ashamed and said, "I was being reckless, while the prime minister had the country's best interests at heart." So, the old general took off his coat and, with a thorny branch on his back, went to apologize to show his sincerity. As soon as Lin Xiangru heard that the general had come, he quickly rushed out and helped the general up. From that moment on, the two became bosom friends. What is commendable about General Lian Po is that he could recognize his mistakes and correct them. He could immediately prioritize the good of the country. Lin Xiangru's generosity and foresight are also something that we admire.

When we are clear about our mistakes, we must never hide them. "If concealed, an error multiplies." In our few decades of life, we must give a good account of ourselves. History cannot be rewritten. If there is the slightest deviation, we must correct it as soon as possible to leave a good example for future generations.

To correct mistakes, we must first be remorseful. To be remorseful, we must first be aware of our mistakes. Understanding the principles allows us to discern right from wrong. What young people today lack the most is a standard of right and wrong. When we study *Standards for Students*, we have a standard for what is right and wrong and how to conduct ourselves as people. This *Standards for Students* must be the family rules for the family, the classroom rules for the class, and the company regulations for the company. This is very important. Ancient families all had family rules. We don't have them now. What rules do families follow? The father has one set of rules, the mother has another, and the son has another. Wouldn’t that be a mess? Therefore, we must first establish family rules so that we have a standard for right and wrong, and this enables us to know our mistakes, feel remorse, and correct our mistakes. Only by correcting mistakes can we improve. If we don’t correct our mistakes, we will always be worried and fearful that people will discover them. If we are found out, we become worthless and even make others look down on us and lose trust in us. Therefore, we should be courageous in admitting our mistakes so that we can walk through life with integrity.

**V. Universal Love**

**1. The Earth is a Living Community; Besides Loving People, We Must Cherish All Animals, Organisms, and Plants.**

*All people must be loved; heaven covers them all, and the earth sustains them all.*

We should respect our parents and elders and respect everyone. When you respect everyone, their parents and relatives will be very happy. If you show great respect and care for the parents of your friends, your friends will have even deeper affection for you. Therefore, we must be respectful to everyone. Respect is not just something you say. You must guide children to be respectful and helpful to the elderly, the weak, women, and children. On the bus, if you see the elderly or pregnant women, you should give up your seat immediately. This is how to put it into practice in daily life. We should further guide them to be more respectful to the disabled and those who are living in hardship. When you face a person with a disability, can you show a look of disdain? Can you just stare at them? No, they would feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, when we face the disabled or those struggling with hardship, we must have respect in our hearts and give them help in their lives. So, we should often take children to orphanages and nursing homes so they can see that there are many people in society who need care and help, and their compassion will grow.

During the Warring States period, there was a famous prime minister named Sun Shu’ao who was very virtuous. One day, when he was working outside, he saw a two-headed snake. It was rumored in their village that anyone who saw a two-headed snake would not survive. Thus, he immediately picked up a stick, killed the two-headed snake, buried it, and then went home crying. His mother, seeing him cry, asked him, "Why are you crying?" Sun Shu’ao said, “I won't be able to take care of you, because I saw a two-headed snake. My life is probably over." See how young Sun Shu’ao was when he saw the two-headed snake. He didn't think that his life was going to end, but rather he wanted to bury it so that other people would not see it, and he was very sad. Why? Because he was afraid he couldn't take care of his mother. His mother was also very pleased after hearing this. She knew her child was truly thoughtful of others, so she said, “You don't need to worry. With such a good heart, you will have blessings in the future.” Later, when Sun Shu’ao grew up, he became prime minister of the State of Chu and was very successful. Good deeds are rewarded. If you have a kind heart, you will be blessed.

In Australia, people are very kind to animals. When I was in Australia, I saw the way they grew their vegetables. They grew however they wanted, but they grew especially big and sweet. This is because the people are kind and therefore the weather is good, bringing good harvests. When they build a road and encounter a tree with a bird’s nest, they won’t continue building the road. Instead, they will wait until the young birds grow up and fly away before cutting down the tree. When we respect all living things, all living things naturally respect us. Conversely, when we disrespect nature, nature will strike back, with natural disasters following one after another. Therefore, it is important to cultivate children’s kindness toward all living things and the earth from a young age.

**2. Strive to Enhance One’s Virtue and Ability; It Is Not a Person’s Appearance That Is Respected by the Public**

*A person of high conduct has high renown; people value virtue, not appearance.*

"A person of high conduct has high renown; people value virtue, not appearance." A person of virtue will naturally have their name spread far and wide. Confucius said in the *Analects*, "The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a petty person is like the grass. When the wind blows over the grass, the grass will bend." The "petty person" refers to ordinary people. "When the wind blows over the grass, the grass will bend" means that when a person of virtue influences others, ordinary people will be educated and follow the good examples. Thus, those with virtue have true moral and academic achievement and will naturally achieve the effect of "peach and plum trees do not speak, yet a path is formed beneath them". Therefore, when Confucius was teaching, many scholars from various countries came to study with him.

The *Analects* mentions four things Confucius worried about every day: “Not cultivating virtue, not speaking of learning, hearing what is right but not changing, and not correcting wrong is what I worry about.” Confucius actively cultivated his virtue every day. He worried about letting a day pass in vain, so he wouldn't “not cultivate virtue” or “not speak of learning”. When he understood a principle, he would speak about it to let more people benefit and let more people’s wisdom grow.


Okay, here's my translation of the provided text, keeping in mind the goal of accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**"Hearing Righteousness, Not Refraining from Action," and "Not Correcting What is Wrong, Not Relaxing"**

"Hearing righteousness, not refraining from action" means that when one knows what is right, one must do it without hesitation. "Not correcting what is wrong, not relaxing" means that one should constantly reflect on one's shortcomings and quickly correct them, never becoming complacent. Confucius held these principles close to his heart. Consequently, his virtue and contributions to society naturally earned him the respect and admiration of all people.  Therefore, “a person of high conduct is naturally held in high esteem; people value them not for their looks." It's certainly not because he was handsome; outward appearance alone cannot inspire heartfelt respect.

**"Talent is Great, Reputation is Great," and "People are Convinced, Not by Boasting"**

"Talent is great, reputation is great" signifies that a truly talented person's reputation will spread naturally.  "People are convinced, not by boasting" means that a person's talent shouldn't come from self-promotion or exaggeration but rather from the genuine admiration of others.  Moreover, “talent” must be built upon a foundation of virtue, which is why the preceding sentence speaks of "a person of high conduct". When combined with virtue, one's talents can benefit family and society. However, if talent is used solely for personal gain, it will never earn the respect of others.

When we see others with talent, we often feel envious. It's the same with children. Talent is a result. But what is the cause?  We need to guide children to look beyond simply envying others. They must realize that talent is not achieved overnight.  "If you want to master a skill, grind an iron pestle into a needle."  All abilities don't fall from the sky; success is truly built on "perseverance".

Today, with the rise of high-tech crime, the greater one's talent, the greater the potential for harm.  We must be mindful of this.  Throughout history, many who have harmed their countries possessed great talent. Therefore, it’s crucial to guide our children to pursue talent with the right purpose. If, for example, a child wants to become a writer, how should we guide them? Some might say, "If you write a good book, you can make a lot of money, and everyone will admire you." This kind of thinking steers them towards a shallow life driven by fame and fortune. A writer is also a social worker. What is their most important duty and responsibility?  We must remind them to focus on exposing vice and promoting virtue, ensuring that their writing can transform societal customs, which would be the best service to themselves and to society.

Many people, when they become teachers, are immediately asked by friends and family, "You must be earning a lot now!" But what is a teacher's most important responsibility? Why doesn't anyone mention it? As Han Yu said, "A teacher's duty is to impart the Way, to transmit knowledge, and to resolve doubts."  Teachers should convey the Way, but they themselves don't even know what it is; they are supposed to resolve doubts, yet they probably have many doubts about their own lives.  How can they resolve others' doubts?  If they don't even understand the principles themselves, how can they teach their students?  When society only focuses on profit, it loses sight of the essential duty of every profession.

If you have a younger relative who has just been admitted to a teacher training college, don’t let them waste those four years. It’s essential to instill in them the correct view: teaching is a service of immeasurable merit. If you are dedicated to teaching and educating other people’s children well, who then become parents themselves, it will affect their descendants for generations, earning “immeasurable merit.” Conversely, if you are not diligent in your teaching and mislead young minds, who will in turn pass those errors to their children, you will commit a great sin, earning "immeasurable demerit," resulting in a dark future.  It's truly a difference that is a world apart.

An elder once said that modern education teaches everything but one thing: “virtue,” or rather, it lacks moral education. What is a doctor's most important duty? To save lives.  What do parents tell their children when they send them to medical school? They say: "I've already invested so much money in you, you need to quickly earn it back." When doctors are obsessed with money, and practice without virtue, can patients feel safe? You might be fine, but they could still perform surgery, causing patients pain and fear! When teachers lack virtue, parents will be incredibly worried, and society will be deeply concerned that we cannot nurture good leaders for the next generation.

Similarly, the police force is also critical. If the police lack virtue, can the people feel safe? Criminals are already terrifying, but when law enforcement is also a threat, that is even worse.  If these three professions lack virtue, the entire societal atmosphere will be greatly impacted. The legal profession is also important, for lawyers should be helping people fight for justice.  However, if they lack virtue, they can also undermine justice. These are all crucial professions within society. When our children consider entering these fields, we must guide them with the right principles.

**3. Be Willing to Help Others and Learn to Appreciate Their Talents**

**"If One Has Ability, Do Not be Selfish; If Others Have Ability, Do Not Lightly Criticize"**

"If one has ability, do not be selfish."  If you have talent and ability, you should not be selfish. When you are able to help others, you should extend a helping hand. When you use your ability to help others, you cultivate three types of giving (charity, teaching, and courage). People love wealth but don't understand that giving is the cause of wealth. They desire wisdom but don't realize that teaching is the cause. They hope for good health and long life but don’t understand that offering courage is the cause. When we understand these principles and constantly concern ourselves with the suffering of others, we naturally embody the Heaven’s virtue of cherishing life and will thus attain good health and longevity as a result. Teaching others and sharing your experiences is using your effort and experience; it is a form of inner giving. In the process of guiding others, you are also teaching them, thus increasing your own wisdom. When we impart the principles of being a good person to others, and their lives improve, which stabilizes their families, this also falls under courageous giving. Teaching encompasses all three forms of giving and addresses a person’s fundamental issues. As they say, “help people in urgent need rather than in their poverty.” You can offer temporary assistance, but if their mindset doesn't change, your help may encourage dependence and become counterproductive. Therefore, the most fundamental way to help is to impart the correct teaching, changing their mindset and thus addressing the root of the problem.

We must teach our children, "If one has ability, do not be selfish", for the greater the generosity, the greater the blessing.  There was a teacher who, from a young age, always helped his parents with housework and cared for his younger siblings.  He seemed like he was working very hard. However, later, in primary, middle, and high school, even through university, although he never sought to be a class monitor or a leader, opportunities always seemed to present themselves to him.  In university, he was unexpectedly entrusted with the work of the student union president because his upbringing had developed his exceptional work ethic.  He did not seek fame, yet fame came to him.  When a child is willing to accept hard work and difficulties, that effort is never wasted, and it solidifies their abilities. One day, when the teachers were preparing dumplings, another teacher looked at this teacher named Cui in astonishment. "I can only make one dumpling," he exclaimed, "and he's already made five or six!"  Because he had done so much work since childhood, his work efficiency was particularly good.  People should never fear hard work or difficulties, because ultimately, the greatest benefit will be theirs.  Therefore, "If one has ability, do not be selfish."

Fan Zhongyan, a prime minister of the Song Dynasty, met a fortune teller as a child. He asked the fortune teller, "Can you tell me, will I become a prime minister?" The fortune teller was surprised because this child, at such a young age, was very ambitious. So, when the fortune teller responded with surprise, Fan Zhongyan felt somewhat embarrassed and lowered his head, then said, "Otherwise, how about this, can you tell me if I'll become a doctor?" The fortune teller was puzzled by this child. First, he asked if he would become a prime minister, but now he lowered his ambition to a doctor. He asked, "Why are your two desires so different?"  Fan Zhongyan replied, "Because only a good prime minister and a good doctor can truly save people." A good prime minister can manage the country’s policies well and help countless citizens, while a doctor can help people escape the suffering of illness.  When the fortune teller heard Fan Zhongyan’s response, he was very moved. He recognized that this young child’s ambition was not for himself but for helping others, and said to Fan Zhongyan, “With this heart, you will certainly become a prime minister. This is the heart of a true prime minister."

Because Fan Zhongyan aspired to be prime minister from a young age, when he studied the Four Books and Five Classics, he focused on learning how to govern a country and pacify the world, while other scholars focused on studying for personal advancement and wealth.  Thus, their perspectives were naturally different.  Therefore, when children establish their aspirations early, they can dedicate themselves to achieving their goals. Moreover, those who follow the Way receive abundant support. When a child truly cultivates the heart to benefit society, they will encounter many helpful people throughout their lives.

When Fan Zhongyan became an official, he purchased a lot of charitable land and provided it to his relatives for farming, taking care of over 300 of them.  Fan Zhongyan’s achievements are second only to Confucius, exceeding even the achievements of past emperors. Fan Zhongyan’s family has prospered for over 800 years, and Confucius’s family for over 2000 years, because they both dedicated themselves to society.

Besides wholeheartedly helping his relatives financially, Fan Zhongyan also built schools to provide more scholars with sage teachings, enabling them to serve their country.  The school that Fan Zhongyan founded produced hundreds of scholars who passed the imperial examination and dozens of top scholars even until the Qing dynasty.  The site of the school is still a well-known high school today. "If one has ability, do not be selfish," and the people will naturally be drawn to you. Fan Zhongyan’s virtue ensured the protection of his descendants. As the I Ching says, "The family that accumulates good deeds will surely have surplus blessings."

“If others have ability, do not lightly criticize.” When we see that others have talent and abilities, we absolutely should not belittle or denigrate them. When envy arises, virtue diminishes, and kindness is overtaken, causing daily unhappiness. Why not broaden our hearts and cultivate: “When speaking of the goodness of others, one’s own heart becomes good, knowing this, they will be more inspired to emulate.” In the past, scholars viewed each other as heroes and admired each other because it is rare to have good people who benefit society. We should help others achieve their goals and support them to the best of our ability, working together for the good.  We should embrace an attitude of “not seeking personal credit, but ensuring no mistakes are made.”  Within a group, one should rejoice in the good deeds of others, thus our merits would be no different from theirs.

**4. Understanding that Flattering the Wealthy and Despising the Poor is a Base Mentality**

**“Do not Flatter the Rich, Do not be Arrogant to the Poor, Do Not Dislike the Old, Do Not Love the New”**

“Do not flatter the rich, do not be arrogant to the poor.” We should not fawn over the wealthy; nor should we be arrogant and look down upon the poor. Zilu once asked Confucius, "How is it if one is poor but not fawning, and rich but not arrogant?" This meant that the poor do not flatter the wealthy, and the wealthy are not arrogant. Could this be considered cultivation? Confucius said it was acceptable, but one should aspire to a higher level: "to be happy while poor, and to be courteous while wealthy." Even in poverty, one should not flatter others, understanding the reasons for their poverty and sowing the seeds of wealth through acts of charity. Then one can “create one's own destiny.”  Scholars who understand these principles can live happily in poverty and act like a true gentleman.  To be courteous while wealthy means that even with great wealth, one remains humble and polite, never changing their attitude towards others because of money, and they must also know how to help the poor.  Thus, whether in wealth or poverty, one can live with peace of mind.

“The Zhu Family Maxims” states: "Those who show fawning expressions to the rich and powerful are most shameful."  Flattering the wealthy is unpleasant to watch and truly disgraceful! "Those who are arrogant towards the poor and treat them with scorn are despicable beyond words." Looking down on the poor and bullying them is extremely base. Although one may be rich, one's behavior is not noble, but rather contemptible. When my students read this passage of “The Zhu Family Maxims”, they would read the sentences very calmly but became very impassioned when reading these two, indicating that these words have left a deep impression on them. In their future dealings with others, they should follow this teaching and never look down on the poor nor flatter the wealthy. Truth be told, those who flatter the wealthy are not always accepted; on the contrary, they may be looked down upon for their ingratiating and fawning words.

“Do not dislike the old, do not love the new” means “to dislike the old and love the new.” What do we think when we see someone who dislikes the old and loves the new? We might shake our heads and say, “the world is going downhill, people’s hearts are not what they used to be.”  What does it mean when people say “hearts are not what they used to be?” It means that people were simple, honest, and kind in the past, which is what the hearts of ancient people were like.  As the saying goes, “old friends are the best” because relationships are built upon shared experiences, mutual support, kindness, and loyalty. There’s a story about Song Hong, who was very loyal to his old friends. Although he had an opportunity to become the brother-in-law of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, he remained unmoved, even saying to the emperor, “The friends made in poverty and humility cannot be forgotten, and the wife who shared hardship cannot be abandoned.” Ancient people truly valued loyalty and morality more than their lives.

Some people, even with a knife to their throat, would rather die than violate morality.  Wen Tianxiang faced death with composure and was willing to die for his ideals.  While in prison he wrote, “The cauldron is as sweet as candy,” meaning he was not afraid of these torture devices, and wished only to die with dignity.  “Who can escape death since the beginning of time? Let me leave a pure heart to shine upon history.” His noble spirit has inspired scholars for centuries and still influences us today.

During the Han dynasty, there was a scholar named Xun Juber. Once, he visited a friend who was sick. At the time, visiting a friend involved traveling long distances and crossing mountains. While he was taking care of his friend, a group of robbers invaded the village, looting and killing people, and everyone fled. His friend was very ill and could not move easily, so he said to Xun Juber, “You must leave quickly. I can’t leave, so don't let them harm you.” However, Xun Juber replied, “If I leave, I will lose my integrity. I would rather die than leave.” When the robbers entered, Xun Juber stepped forward and said to them, “My friend is very sick. Please do not hurt him. If you must harm someone, harm me instead.”  Xun Juber spoke with great conviction. The robbers were confused. Everyone else had fled, but here was someone unafraid to die, protecting his sick friend.  After understanding his intentions, the robbers were moved. The leader said, “We are unrighteous people; how could we plunder this place where there is righteousness?” So the robbers retreated.  Therefore, a person’s integrity and genuine heart can awaken the sense of morality in others. Xun Juber’s integrity saved many people’s lives and prevented further suffering.

We can see that ancient people were always thinking of others, while modern people think first of themselves. The more we think of ourselves, the more narrow our path in life becomes, as those who have lost morality have few helpers while those who have morality have abundant helpers. When a child has a kind heart from a young age, their path will become increasingly broad. Therefore, towards our friends and our spouses, we should "not dislike the old, not love the new."

When a person is kind, they are not only considerate towards people but also towards material things. For example, if a piece of clothing was knitted by their mother, because they are grateful towards their parents, they will cherish that clothing and wear it for decades. When one can understand the labor involved, when something was given by family, they will not damage or waste it, because filial respect has become the essence of their actions.  Respect for things naturally stems from respect for people.  Fundamentally, we must teach our children to cherish kindness and gratitude.

**5. In Interactions With Others, Be Mindful and Considerate of Their Feelings**

**“When People Are Not Free, Do Not Bother Them; When People Are Unsettled, Do Not Disturb Them with Talk”**

“When people are not free, do not bother them; when people are unsettled, do not disturb them with talk." Our kindness should always be apparent in our actions. Kindness is certainly not only about saying, "I am very kind to people; I have a kind heart."  Good intentions can sometimes cause pressure on others. Even if you want to give them good things, you need to consider whether it is convenient for them or if they have time.  Therefore, we must be more aware of when to proceed and when to hold back.

When we call a friend, we should never just start talking immediately, but first ask, "Is it convenient for you to talk right now?"  When people hear such words, they feel very comfortable. If they are busy, they will naturally tell you, "I am busy right now; perhaps you can call me later."  Courtesy is expressed everywhere in life and is a beautiful distance between people.  With courtesy, it is less likely to have awkward situations or conflicts.  Besides checking before making a phone call, we should also avoid calling during meal times or late at night, which is also a way to consider others.

In addition to phone calls, whenever we need to discuss something with others, we must first observe whether they are available at that time.  Nowadays, many children, when they think of something, will immediately pull on their parents' clothes and insist that they help, regardless of the situation. These situations present opportunities for immediate education. It is not only children who need this education but also adults. Without reminders, we may lose that sensitivity. What happens when a person is in a bad mood? They need some peace and quiet. This is not the time to keep chattering at them. As they often say in soap operas, “Leave me alone; let me have some peace and quiet!” So, we must learn to observe others’ moods.

However, when our loved ones are at their lowest point, even contemplating ending their lives, we can’t ignore them. We can bring a warm cup of tea into their room, gently put it on their table without looking at them, and then quietly leave the room.  This lets them know that someone still cares. When people feel that they are cared for, they will not resort to desperate measures. Even with our closest loved ones, when we communicate, we must consider their feelings to ensure that we can maintain harmonious relationships.

**6. Praise Others' Strengths, Do Not Publicly Comment on or Spread Their Faults and Shortcomings**

**“When People Have Shortcomings, Do Not Expose Them; When People Have Secrets, Do Not Speak of Them”**

“When people have shortcomings, do not expose them; when people have secrets, do not speak of them.”  The “Ma Jiajue Incident” in mainland China made everyone reflect. Ma Jiajue was an outstanding college student, who killed four students because of a conflict with them, and became wanted by the police across the country. This incident shook the entire education system, prompting a reconsideration of the importance of moral education for young people. Why would someone who has not even entered society yet do something so cruel?

Why did the desire to kill arise in him? His classmates often made fun of him for being poor. In prison, he told the warden, “This prison uniform is the best clothing I’ve ever worn.”  When his classmates mocked him, his sense of inferiority grew stronger, which triggered this irrational behavior. From this event, we learn that parents should see things from another perspective. Why were these classmates killed?  It was not by chance! It’s because they did not know proper behavior, did not learn “do not flatter the rich, do not be arrogant to the poor,” and did not learn “when people have shortcomings, do not expose them; when people have secrets, do not speak of them."  They made fun of other people's private matters. No wonder they were met with such an irrational response.  There is also a saying: “When exposing the evil of others, you are evil yourself; when pushing it too far, misfortune will follow.”  Even a cornered dog will jump a wall, let alone a person!  Ma Jiajue never learned *Di Zi Gui*. If he had learned “everyone deserves our care”, he wouldn’t have done this. If he had learned “brothers should be friendly, and siblings should be respectful” and "by restraining one's speech, anger will naturally be extinguished", this tragedy would not have happened.

Therefore, families and schools must reflect on this incident. Why didn’t this high-achieving college student learn these basic principles? We cannot be overwhelmed by superficial "fame." We need to see that a solid and successful life is not built on academic achievement, but rather on virtue. From this event, we should understand the importance of being mindful in our words and actions.

**“When Speaking of the Good of Others, Your Heart Becomes Good, Knowing This, You Will Be More Inspired to Emulate”**

“When speaking of the good of others, your heart becomes good; knowing this, you will be more inspired to emulate.”


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, maintaining the original meaning and tone while ensuring readability for an English-speaking audience:

**Reflecting on Our Reactions to Others’ Shortcomings**

Let's examine these passages of scripture and reflect on how you feel when you hear something negative about someone else. You likely feel uncomfortable. At that moment, the water crystals in your cells become distorted. Conversely, when a person speaks kind words and praises others, the water crystals within our bodies become healthy. In the family, we should also frequently "speak well of others." For example, if your mother-in-law has helped you with some tasks, you could say in front of family or friends, "My mother-in-law has been a great help and has done so much for me." When you express this, your mother-in-law will feel happy. Your kind words will encourage her to continue helping. So, don't be stingy with praise. Of course, this praise should not be given with the intention of manipulating others to help you, but rather, should stem from a genuine feeling of gratitude.

**Publicizing Others’ Faults: A Grave Error**

To speak ill of others is itself an evil. It's a serious affliction, and it can bring about misfortune. When we publicize others' shortcomings, they will feel very distressed if they find out. It is what is called "backstabbing." "Those who are harmed often feel it as if carved in bone." When you criticize someone with harsh words, it is as if those words are engraved in their bones. They will often think of retaliating against you, acting out of spite. This is not a wise course of action. Therefore, we should not publicize the bad deeds of others, or we will be setting ourselves up for enemies. Having ten friends is not too many, but having just one enemy can be incredibly vexing. We should cultivate a kind heart and not provoke conflict with others. If we do not praise others' good deeds, but immediately broadcast their minor misdeeds, not only do we diminish our own blessings, but more significantly, we also negatively impact the atmosphere of the community and society. If everyone only speaks ill of others and ignores their good deeds, this will lead to serious social problems, and conflicts between people will be endless. Therefore, we need to consider that a person’s words and actions affect the overall social climate. This sin is not merely individual; it can bring guilt to the entire society. Therefore, we must be cautious with our words.

**7. Mutual Encouragement and Private Reminders of Faults**

When it comes to "good," we must first distinguish between genuine good and false good, right good and wrong good. Many of these judgments are found in the book, “Liao Fan’s Four Lessons”. How did the ancients accept good advice or virtuous words and actions? Confucius praised Yan Hui, saying that “he embraces a good deed, cherishing it in his heart and never letting it go.” As soon as Yan Hui heard of a good deed, he immediately kept it in his heart, determined to put it into practice. So, whenever the topic of virtue was mentioned, Confucius would directly speak about “Yan Hui who loved to learn.” The Master was very pleased with this student because his learning was so solid. Anything the teacher said or taught, he would practice without forgetting. Therefore, when we adopt such an attitude towards learning what is good, we will naturally "establish virtue".

In ancient times, officials were often called “parent officials.” Why were they called that? Because the magistrate of the county was very close to the people, and the county magistrate was responsible for the educational policy and content of the entire county. He had the responsibility to educate the people of his jurisdiction well. He had an attitude of "loving the people as if they were his own children," hence they were called parent officials. Of course, these local leaders also had to put into practice “to mutually encourage the good and establish virtue,” so that the social environment could improve continuously.

During the Sui Dynasty, there was a parent official named Xin Gongyi. It was unlikely that someone with a name meaning “public righteousness” would commit crimes. Because people called him “Gongyi” every day, he would certainly embody integrity and honesty. When he was the Prefect in Minzhou (present-day Gansu), the local custom was to abandon anyone who contracted a plague, leaving them to fend for themselves. He felt that this was extremely cruel, a loss of both filial piety and righteousness. Therefore, he took the initiative to bring all the sick people abandoned by the roadside to his government office to care for them and also found many doctors to treat them. When the patients recovered, he would quickly ask their families to take them home. When they came to pick them up he would say, "I’ve been in close contact with your father for so long, and as you can see, I am not sick.” The children were ashamed of their behavior. This Prefect used virtue to awaken the shame of these people, so they quickly brought their families home to care for them, thereby reversing the trend of this unfilial custom. Therefore, the locals called him a "benevolent mother," treating him like their own mother. This “benevolent mother” not only saved the health of their loved ones but also saved everyone's conscience. A person who loses their conscience, even if they still live, is merely a walking corpse. That’s why the ancients would rather die than violate moral principles.

"If faults are not corrected, both ways are lost." If we fail to advise someone when it is appropriate, we are failing in our roles as parents, friends, husbands, wives, or children. Giving advice requires seizing the right opportunity and using the right approach and attitude. When we can practice "Do not expose others' shortcomings and keep their secrets private,” a peaceful atmosphere will be formed. Also “Praising the good of others is itself a good deed, and when people know this, they will be further encouraged.” A group that is very harmonious and cohesive will certainly prosper. Therefore, when we are among others we must value harmony, and then seize opportunities to “praise the good in public and correct the faults in private”, respecting others’ feelings.

**8.  Do Not Compete With Others and Avoid Taking Advantage**

In dealing with giving and receiving, it’s important to have clear distinctions. It is better to give more and take less. For instance, when a family or clan is dividing possessions, it should depend on the situation. When the other side is in difficulty, we should give more and take less for ourselves. When everyone has such a spirit of courtesy, the family environment will be one of mutual consideration and concessions, and there will be no conflicts. When the family has such harmony, the entire family will truly prosper. As mentioned before, “Avoid disputes when at home.” If family members take each other to court because of an unfair division, there will be no good outcome. It will even set a bad example for their descendants. Even if they have enormous wealth, it will eventually be ruined. Thus, when possible, we should always yield. In the Zhou Dynasty, Taibo and Zhongyong yielded the kingdom to their younger brother and then to their nephew, thus creating the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty for 800 years and inspiring the people of the country to emulate this spirit of filial piety.

People are often afraid of yielding, feeling that if they yield, they will lose something. People cannot only look at what is before their eyes. When you yield, you are actually perfecting your own virtue and the harmony of the family, and this yielding is accumulating blessings for yourself. When you have many blessings, there will be a corresponding return in the future. “Heaven is impartial and always helps the virtuous.” This is an immutable principle. Therefore, people should not follow their afflictions, not follow their habits, but should follow heavenly principles and people’s hearts.

**9. Cultivate Forgiveness and Empathy**

If we do not wish for others to slander or criticize us, we should not slander or criticize others. If we do not want others to offend or control us, then we should not offend or control others. Even in our thoughts, if we do not want others to wish us harm, we should not harbor thoughts of harming others. When we treat others in this way, we will naturally be able to conduct ourselves appropriately.

There is a story of a dog who ran into a space surrounded by glass. Upon entering, it saw another dog looking very ferocious and immediately started barking at “it”. As it barked, all the dogs around it also barked at it. It, in turn, was unwilling to yield and continued barking desperately. What was the final outcome? The dog died of exhaustion. From this story, we can reflect. When we feel that those around us are treating us poorly and often lose their temper at us, we need to reflect back on ourselves. It is highly likely that the people and events we are encountering are reflections of our own hearts. When we often meet others with an angry face, the image we receive back is definitely an angry face. Conversely, when we always greet people with a smile, we will receive smiles back in return. At this time, we should calm down and reflect. What kind of attitude and expressions do our relatives and friends show when they are facing us? When we think and reflect like this, we will realize how to correct and improve ourselves.

When we have a forgiving heart towards others, our relationships will undergo major changes. Therefore, “Before acting on others, ask yourself.” We should always try to think from the other person's perspective. "Forgive others as you would forgive yourself, and you will have many friends. Be as strict with yourself as you are with others, and you will have fewer mistakes." How many times a day do we forgive ourselves? That number is large, probably many times. However, if someone else makes a mistake, we might feel angry and unable to get over it. This is not fair. So, we should change our perspective and forgive others as we forgive ourselves. It will then be easy to be tolerant and accepting. Furthermore, we should do our best to help and guide others, and we will make many friends throughout the world. When we apply such a critical standard to ourselves that we would to others, our mistakes will continuously diminish. This is the meaning of "virtue improves daily, and mistakes become fewer."

Many obstacles are not external, but within our own thoughts. The reason we suffer is often because we are demanding, we only demand things from others, and not from ourselves. When we can forgive others, and see our own responsibilities, our entire life attitude will change. When people demand something, they worry about gaining and losing every day. When we see our own responsibilities, we will do our best every day. And when we do our best each day, we will grow and experience the joy of growth.

During the Song Dynasty, there was a scholar named Liu Kuan. What do you think of someone when you hear that name? (Kuan meaning “tolerant” or “lenient”) Liu Kuan was indeed a tolerant person. His family had never seen him angry, so they deliberately tested him. As Liu Kuan was dressed in his court robes, ready to go to court for the morning session, the family arranged for a maid to bring him a bowl of hot soup. As she entered the room, she pretended to trip, spilling the hot soup on Liu Kuan's clothes. Liu Kuan immediately stood up and the first words he said were: “Are you hurt?” His family was completely in awe of him. From a person's first reaction, you can see their true intention. Just like when the stable in Confucius’ house caught fire, the first thing Confucius asked upon hearing the news was: “Is anyone injured?” The Master's constant concern was that no one should be harmed. This is what it means to be "compassionate and tolerant." When we truly practice “compassion and tolerance,” we will be good parents in the family, good leaders in an organization, and respected elders in society.

**10.  Learn to be Grateful, Express Gratitude, and Repay Kindness. Do Not Punish Yourself for Others' Faults.**

"Kindness should be repaid; grudges should be forgotten." Repaying a grudge is short; repaying kindness is long. "Kindness should be repaid," which means that when a person constantly remembers the kindness of their parents, teachers, and others, their spiritual life will surely be very fulfilling. The foundation of one's happiness lies in love and gratitude. When a person understands love and giving, they will realize their own value. It is more blessed to give than to receive.

"Grudges should be forgotten." Conflicts between people are inevitable, but "there is often something pitiful in a hateful person.” People cause conflict because they do not understand the principles of life. When there are conflicts, we should first reflect on ourselves. If we are not at fault, we should try to be more tolerant. We should not put other’s faults in our hearts, because putting another's dirty things into our pure hearts is foolish. Forgiving others is actually forgiving yourself. It is unbearable if you hold the faults of others in your heart every day. So, we must be able to “not remember past wrongs and not hate people.” We should not dwell on past conflicts, because when you hold a grudge in your heart, the other person can sense it. When people hold resentment, it will definitely show in their eyes and expressions. “Sincerity within will be expressed outwardly.” And if the heart is insincere, that will also be expressed outwardly. If this resentment cannot be released, the relationship between the two people will definitely grow more distant, which is not good. After all, you may need to interact with each other every day or regularly see them in your workplace. Therefore, when two people cannot accept each other, it is very likely to impact the harmony of a family or an organization. Why put yourself in such a situation?

As the saying goes, "People who are destined to be together will meet even if they are a thousand miles apart." Whether it is a good connection or a bad one, as long as our heart remains equal and compassionate, then even a negative connection can be transformed into a positive one. Thus, we should strive for "equal treatment of those we like and those we dislike." Only when we truly practice this equality will others respect us from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, we must broaden our minds. “Kindness should be repaid, and grudges should be forgotten.” Actually, many of our attachments can be transformed into wisdom as long as we change our thoughts. Therefore, people need to know how to change their thoughts.

People often progress the most when they are in adverse situations, so we should be grateful to those who hurt us, because they temper our minds. We should be grateful to those who deceive us, because they enhance our understanding. As the saying goes, "Experience is the best teacher." We should be grateful to those who trip us up, because they strengthen our abilities. We should be grateful to those who abandon us, because they teach us to be independent. Whose reliance can you depend on for life? It is not possible! This “reliance” is not in the physical sense. A person needs to grow in their mental capacity. The most important thing in life is to rely on one's own true wisdom. So, be grateful to those who criticize us, because they are increasing our wisdom and concentration. Therefore, "When parents teach, listen respectfully. When parents criticize, obey obediently." This is not just about our parents. Whenever anyone criticizes us, we should accept it humbly and listen carefully. In doing so, we will be improving our moral character and knowledge.

“Repaying a grudge is short; repaying kindness is long.” “Repaying a grudge is short” does not mean actually repaying it. It means turning away the thought of resentment as quickly as possible. “Repaying kindness is long,” does not mean a long time, it means long lasting. How could we ever fully repay the kindness of our parents and teachers? We must have the attitude of “exerting ourselves to the utmost, even unto death.” When I said this, did your hearts suddenly light up? Because when I was in high school, I had this experience twice. The first time was when I heard Fan Zhongyan’s words in *The Yueyang Tower*: "Be the first to worry about the world’s troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures." I suddenly experienced a flash of light, for about five or ten seconds. Then I fell back into a state of confusion, because I hadn’t understood the language of the classics at that point. Then, another time, when I read *The Memorial on Going to War* and saw Kongming’s words “exerting myself to the utmost, even unto death”, I suddenly experienced another flash of light. But the light needs to be continuous. So, when we encounter sacred teachings, we should not miss them again. Sages have sincerely put on these wonderful performances for us, and we must learn from them. It is because of this kindness that we can move towards a brighter future. Without them, we wouldn't be who we are. Therefore, with this attitude, we should try our best to fulfill our duties, so that those who have been kind to us can be happy to see our growth and our happy life.

**11. Even With Servants at Home, One Should Do Their Own Tasks**

The treatment of maids and servants should be respectful, and though they are to be treated with respect, we should also be compassionate and generous. Nowadays, many families hire help to take care of their children, cook meals, and even drive. Therefore, when we are with our children, we should guide them to respect all the elders who assist us. When seeing our driver, Mr. Chen, we should tell our children to call him “Uncle Chen.” And they should call our cook, Mrs. Wang, “Auntie Wang”. We must not allow children to have a sense of social hierarchy at a young age. If they look down on those who help with tasks, then they will lose their respect from a young age, which is contrary to the Dao. Having wealth, in this way, will ruin a child’s life. Today's phenomena of comparison and vanity are very serious, and we must be cautious in how we address this.

There was a kindergartner whose father was a taxi driver. One day, his father drove him to kindergarten. After he got out of the car, this child happened to meet his classmate. As the two were walking into the classroom, his father did not immediately drive away. The two kids were having this conversation: "Who was the person driving the car?" The child replied, "That's our driver." It was his own father, but he said it was their driver. Look, even kindergarten kids these days are into comparisons and vanity. This is very dangerous. So that father became alarmed, and the next day transferred his child to another school. It is likely that all the children in that kindergarten were children of high-ranking officials.

There was a public kindergarten in Beijing where most of the students were children whose families were rich or whose parents were government officials. Each of the children was the apple of their parents' eye. One day, at the end-of-semester performance, not only were the children and parents present, but also the grandparents, drivers, and even professional photographers. Because each family wanted to get the best angle to take pictures of their children, the parents actually started fighting on the spot. So, we have to be very cautious with our words and actions. We should not use our position or power to show off to others or suppress others. We should always treat people with kindness and equality.

“Though they are to be treated with respect, we should also be compassionate and generous.” "Respect" refers to having status. If we have a high position in the country or society, we should never look down on others because of our status. Position and reputation are tied to duties and responsibilities. We have also met the wife of a high-ranking official who frequently attends activities. But she always participates in these activities to raise funds for children in impoverished areas, so they can have an education. When they go to remote areas, some of the children have to get up at 3:00 or 4:00 AM, walk for four hours to get to school, study for a few hours, and then walk for another four hours to get back home. Isn’t this hard work? There are so many people in the world who need help.

A friend of mine went to one of these fundraising locations and met these children. A sixth-grade student told them, "Uncle, I won't be able to come to school tomorrow." The uncle asked why. The student replied, “My father passed away, and I am the oldest child in the family. My grandmother and mother need me to help them with farm work, so we can survive." This friend was deeply moved by this, so he asked, "How much does it cost to attend school for a year?" The student said 200 RMB. The friend immediately took out 1000 RMB and said, "Here is enough for you to study for five years. This 1000 RMB is for your tuition.” He also took out another 1000 RMB and said, “This is for your family to use, so you can focus on your studies.” The child's mother was so moved upon receiving this money. The whole family kneeled down to thank him, saying, "How can there be such good people?" The wife of that high-ranking official said: “Having such a high social position today represents our obligation to society. We should use our reputation and position to benefit society.” They have provided help to over 160 schools already. Therefore, “Though they are to be treated with respect, we should also be compassionate and generous”. We should use a compassionate heart to care for even more people.

We should also love and care for those who come to our homes to help us cook and clean, because it is fate that brought us together. When I was in Haikou, I saw that many of the nannies who came to work were only fourteen or fifteen years old, they were still children themselves! So, if they have the good fortune to enter our home, we must take good care of them and help them develop. We hope that through this connection, their capabilities, and even their thoughts and beliefs, can be improved, so they may have a better future. We should also teach our friends who work for us *The Standards for Being a Good Student and Child*, because for someone to do lower-level work, it could be that in their past lives they had no opportunity to hear the true Dharma, and no chance to cultivate blessings. Now, in this life, they have a connection with us, we must teach them the correct thoughts and beliefs, and teach them methods for changing their lives. This is true compassion. And in that very moment, we will truly put our equality and compassion into practice.

Not only should we be compassionate, but also generous. Everyone makes mistakes, and we should not be overly demanding. “What the creator abhors is being harsh and cunning; and what makes all things interconnected is sincerity and loyalty.” Heaven has a love for life. What the creator abhors is being too harsh and cunning, and what makes all things interconnected is sincerity and loyalty. So when we treat our servants with sincerity and forgiveness, we can leave them with good memories and a positive influence on their lives.


Okay, here is a professional translation of the provided Chinese text into English, aiming for accuracy, clarity, and a natural English flow:

**12. Treat People and Handle Affairs with Equality and Reason, Not Impulsivity**

It is through power that we may subjugate people, but their hearts will not be with us. It is through reason that we convince people, and this will leave them with nothing to say against us.

If we use authority and status to suppress others, they will be very dissatisfied. Although they may appear to be respectful to us on the surface, once they bow and leave, they may begin to criticize and curse us behind our backs. If our respect for others is superficial, we should seriously reflect on ourselves, because such respect is hollow and shallow. We should pursue an authentic life. A child once said, "I forget when my mom hits me, but I always remember when my dad hits me." Why is there such a big difference when it comes to punishment? What is the mother's motivation for hitting him? It is to care for and discipline him. So, after being hit, he understands that he was wrong and will try to correct himself. However, when the father hits him, his motivation may not be to educate him, but rather to let out his anger. This leaves the child feeling resentful, and he remembers it very clearly. Therefore, we must "convince with reason, so there will be no objections." This principle applies to the family, as well as in our workplaces and organizations. Leaders should also have certain rules. They cannot promote someone they like today and then suppress the same person tomorrow, even if they are capable, simply because they no longer like them. Using power to subjugate people cannot win their support. We should follow reason and "convince with reason, so there will be no objections." Only through equality can people have peace of mind. Only through care and respect can the atmosphere of an entire group become increasingly harmonious and kind.

Looking at China’s history spanning thousands of years, dynasties that seized power through authority and force never lasted long. However, dynasties that educated the people with morality and filial piety, and led by example, have had a longer history and a deeper influence on later generations. The longest dynasty in Chinese history was the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled the country with virtue and convinced the people with reason. On the other hand, the Qin Dynasty, which seized power through force, was overthrown in just a few decades. Therefore, from history, we can learn and draw lessons: if we want our families and businesses to prosper and endure, we must absolutely win people's hearts with morality and reason. History allows us to learn from the past to understand the future and enlighten our lives. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past, so that we do not betray the help for life that our ancestors left us in the *Twenty-Five Histories*.

**6. Befriending the Benevolent**

**1. We Must Resolve to Be a Person of Benevolence**

"Though we are all human, we are different. The common are many, the benevolent are rare."

This statement is indeed felt to be true today, but "the common are many, the benevolent are rare" is just the result. We need to find the cause. Why are there so many common people and so few benevolent ones now? It is because of the loss of education. Without the teachings of sages and the distinction between right and wrong, good and evil, even though many are considered “common,” they are actually victims. As the saying goes, “If our ancestors were not good and did not understand morality, and no one told them, there is no reason for us to be surprised.” Because of the lack of education, coupled with the increasing external pollution, without any internal foundation, we are bound to be defeated when attacked from within and without. Therefore, starting from our generation, we must let the teachings of the sages shine in the world. We must firmly plant our feet, ensuring we do not follow the crowd blindly. Once we are stable, we can extend a hand to help others. As our capabilities gradually increase, we can extend our influence from self-cultivation to managing our families, governing our states, and bringing peace to the world. Therefore, we should have confidence that those who truly establish a firm foundation in the teachings of the sages can absolutely transform a family, a group, or a society.

Therefore, when we teach the phrase "the common are many, the benevolent are rare," we will tell the children that although they may not litter, others might. So, from a young age, children must have the attitude of "learning to be a teacher and acting as a model for the world," resolving to be a good example.

"Indeed, a benevolent person inspires awe. Their words are frank, and their expressions are not fawning."

When people see a truly benevolent person, they naturally feel a sense of awe. In the *Analects*, the students described their impression of Confucius, saying that "from afar, he appeared stern," that seeing their teacher from a distance made them feel reverence. "When they approached him, he was gentle." When they actually studied with him, they found their teacher to be very approachable. Because benevolent people always think of others, their words are capable of opening up the wisdom of others; hence, "when they approached him, he was gentle." "Their words are frank, and their expressions are not fawning." Their words would never be evasive, and they would always speak with integrity because those who have no desire are strong. As our motto goes, "A thousand-foot wall stands upright; one is strong without desire." Benevolent people never seek fame or fortune, and they will straightforwardly guide us with their words. "Their expressions are not fawning." “Fawning” refers to flattery and servility. Because they have no desires, they do not need to seek favor from others, and so they do not have a flattering attitude.

**2. Befriend and Associate with Virtuous Individuals**

"Befriending the benevolent brings endless good; virtue grows daily, and faults diminish."

Does "befriending the benevolent" mean seeing them once or twice a month? How often should it be? Constantly. How do we do so? By thoroughly studying the classics, keeping the teachings of the sages in our hearts, and acting in accordance with them. Furthermore, Chinese culture has a core principle: "Ruler, Parent, Teacher." The most venerable in the world are heaven and earth, rulers, parents, and teachers. The most important thing is to manifest the virtue of heaven and earth in our lives, our families, and our contributions to society. Therefore, the Chinese people have special respect for rulers, parents, and teachers. In addition to their status, rulers, parents, and teachers also have an essential meaning. As long as we are constantly aware and reflect on whether we are "acting as a ruler, acting as a parent, and acting as a teacher,” we can always be on the path of the sages. Many people say, “I'm not a business owner, how can I act as a ruler?” In fact, "acting as a ruler" means leading by example, which is leading through one’s own conduct. “Acting as a parent” means caring and nurturing, treating others as family, with love and concern. “Acting as a teacher” means guiding, teaching based on individual needs and grasping many opportunities for instruction. In other words, being an example, showing love, and teaching are the roles of ruler, parent, and teacher, and together they can resolve all interpersonal issues.

If interpersonal problems can be solved, can problems between people and society also be solved? Society is just an accumulation of people. Therefore, as long as you have a good grasp of how to treat people, the problems between people and society will be easily solved, and people and nature can certainly live in harmony. Mencius told us that "by being kind to our loved ones, we can extend that kindness to the people," meaning that we should love and protect the people. "By being kind to the people, we can extend that kindness to all things," meaning that we can extend this kindness to caring for and respecting everything. If we can handle the relationships between people well, the world will be at peace. We should constantly remind ourselves whether we are acting as a ruler, parent, and teacher in our interactions with others. By adopting this attitude, our spiritual cultivation will progress quickly.

Now, parents complain that their children are difficult to manage, teachers complain that their students are difficult to teach, and bosses complain that their employees are difficult to lead. These are the results. What is the cause? A core principle of Confucianism is, "When you encounter obstacles, look within yourself." This phrase is very meaningful, and its origin is in *The Doctrine of the Mean*. In *The Doctrine of the Mean*, Confucius mentions that "archery is similar to the way of a gentleman." When we see archery, when the bow is drawn back and ready to shoot, the arrow is released. If it misses the target, it is called "failing to hit the mark." Who should be blamed if the target is missed? “Look within yourself.” Blame your own poor technique. In contrast, people today, when they shoot an arrow and miss the target, they immediately complain: “Which company made this arrow? It’s made so poorly! Which company made this bow? Why is it so bad?" They do not find the crux of the problem. So, when children are difficult to teach and employees are difficult to lead, no one reflects on themselves.

Why do today’s parents feel they can’t teach their children well? It’s because they have not truly practiced "ruler, parent, and teacher." They also have not coordinated well in terms of being rulers, parents, and teachers. Are today’s parents leading by example? They might tell their children to be filial to their parents, but their own attitude towards their parents is poor, so the children will follow their example. If the parents do not set a good example, the upper beam will not be straight, and the lower beam will certainly be crooked.

As parents, we should consider whether we are acting as a ruler. Parents might say they are fulfilling their role as a parent, which includes providing care, working hard every day to make money for their children, but is that really love? If this kind of love lacks wisdom, it can be harmful. Spoiling children can cause more trouble! Hence, as the Fujian saying goes: “Spoil the pig, and it will knock over the stove; spoil the son, and he will be unfilial; spoil the wife, and she will nag; spoil the husband, and he'll cry in the middle of the night; spoil the daughter, and she will be difficult to manage.” These local proverbs contain deep wisdom. They are passed down from our ancestors, refined, and a single line can greatly awaken us to life.

The education of children must be based on virtue; only then is it true love. Daughters cannot be spoiled either, because if a daughter is spoiled, she may cause turmoil in her husband's family. Therefore, teaching daughters is very important. Now, many young women who get married have very bad tempers. If they get upset, they’ll say, “I’m going home to my parents!” When they return home, their parents will say: "It's okay, come back. Your parents will be your support." Is this true love for the children? No! A woman must learn how to be a wife and a mother. She must learn to endure and learn from her experiences. If she retreats as soon as she is tested, then she will never learn what she needs to learn in this life.

I remember when I was little, my maternal grandparents came to visit us, but their visits were very infrequent, maybe countable on ten fingers. Every time my grandmother came into our house, she would hold my paternal grandmother’s hand, and as they walked, she would say, “My daughter’s not sweet enough. My daughter is very slow. My daughter has many flaws.” She would list all of my mother’s shortcomings. After they sat down, my paternal grandmother would say, “This daughter-in-law is good! She’s good in so many ways!” I, being young, was baffled. I didn’t know what it meant. Now, I understand. You point out the flaws of your family members yourself, and you leave the praise to your in-laws. This is the principle behind the saying, “To be skilled in human interaction is to be able to write great works,” and the skill of human interaction can often be learned from elders who have a wealth of life experiences. Therefore, young people must respect the proper relationships, and they must respect the old and the wise. Otherwise, they will face big losses in life. Parents must also have the right method of love for their children. Only then can they truly be acting as a "parent."

Next, we must act as a “teacher." We must cherish opportunities for teaching. Some parents are too insensitive; when they should teach, they don’t. Eventually, the children develop bad habits, and it's too late. Similarly, why can’t leaders manage their employees well? Perhaps, we only have the title of manager or general manager but are not leading by example, making it hard for employees to be convinced. In addition to being a manager, are you treating your employees like family members? If not, the working atmosphere will be bad. People will just go to work every day like machines. As a supervisor, for example, if you went on a trip, you could buy some local products and share them with all the employees so that they will think that their leader always thinks of them. Running a company atmosphere like a family is being a "parent." To act as a teacher, new employees have a lot that they do not understand. As leaders, we should help and guide them. If we truly act as rulers, parents, and teachers, I believe that employees will be convinced and respectful.

Teachers must also set an example to teach their students well. They should act as “rulers.” They should treat their students like their own children; this is acting as a “parent.” They should make every effort to guide the students when needed; this is acting as a "teacher." I believe that if we act as rulers, parents, and teachers, we will be able to teach our students, employees, and children well. Therefore, as long as we use "ruler, parent, and teacher" to reflect on ourselves constantly, I believe that our moral knowledge will continue to improve.

Colleagues can also act as "ruler, parent, and teacher." If we can abide by the company's rules and set an example, this is "acting as a ruler." If colleagues often care for each other, sharing anything good without hesitation, making them feel you treat them like family, then this is "acting as a parent." If they don't understand something and you have a lot of experience, you can generously guide them; this is "acting as a teacher." Therefore, in order to have harmonious relationships with colleagues, we can use "ruler, parent, and teacher" to reflect on ourselves, and I believe that you will be a good friend who is very important and influential to your colleagues.

Can we act as "ruler, parent, and teacher" for our parents? The answer is yes. The true universal way of the universe applies everywhere. When people get old and they haven't learned from the sages, they become greedy. Therefore, Confucius warned that "the elderly should be careful about their desires," which refers to the mentality of being afraid of loss. At this time, the children need to guide them and persuade them to let go of their attachments. When you persuade them to let go of these attachments, their bodies and minds will become increasingly happy. Therefore, whether an elderly person has a good life is not determined by whether they eat well but by whether their spirit has improved. If we want to be a good spiritual teacher for our parents, we must first be a "ruler," leading by example. Otherwise, your parents will say, "You’re like that, and you still lecture me!" We must be devoted to our filial piety. Then, our parents will trust us more and more. When our parents trust us, they will naturally listen to us. Then, you can give them guidance and enlightenment. This is also acting as a "teacher." Use "ruler, parent, and teacher" to constantly reflect on your words, actions, thoughts, and intentions. That is how to truly be constantly close to the benevolent and close to the sages.

"Not befriending the benevolent brings endless harm; petty people come forward, and all things are ruined."

When we "do not befriend the benevolent," it is likely that we will begin to decline. Many parents say, "My child hasn’t made progress, nor has he regressed." Is that possible? Given the pollution today, even if you live deep in the mountains, it can come through on the television. In fact, if you don’t learn what is correct, you will definitely learn what is wrong. Therefore, both befriending the benevolent and teaching children are urgent. "Studying is like rowing against the current; if you do not advance, you will fall back." We can do an experiment: if we do not listen to the scriptures or approach a wise teacher for three days, what will we feel? Our thoughts will run wild. There is indeed no such thing as neither progressing nor regressing. We must constantly cultivate our minds over a long period of time. Hence, “The most valuable aspect of learning is to know oneself." Only when we truly understand our own nature can we wholeheartedly devote ourselves to learning. The ancients said, "One would rather not read a book for a year than to be near a petty person for even one day," especially when discussing ideas. If someone expresses doubts about our wise teachers or elders, it can easily influence us. Therefore, we should immediately stop them or leave the scene to protect our pure minds.

As elders, we must also protect the pure minds of the next generation. How do we do this? First, we must do our best to exclude anything that pollutes their minds, including television and computers. Second, we must quickly lay the foundation for their virtuous character and their ability to distinguish right from wrong. If we spend five years laying a solid foundation for our children, it will be a very wise life plan. Five years can save us decades of worry and troubles and allow us to live in peace. If these five years of foundation are not taught, we will worry about our children, even our grandchildren, for our entire lives! We might be anxious until the moment we close our eyes. Where can the wisdom of life be seen? In the order of priorities that we set.

**7. Use Remaining Energy to Study the Written Word**

**1. Don't Be Arrogant or Self-Important; Don't Be Stubborn**

“If one only learns the written word but does not act, then one’s character will be hollow. What kind of person will one become?”

Mastering *Standards for Students* is about laying a solid foundation in "primary learning." If the foundation of primary learning is not solid and we begin to read the Four Books and Five Classics, the more the children read, the more disconnected they may become from real life. Some children who have read a lot of classics will use phrases from *The Analects* to argue with their parents. One child, around six years old, was being criticized by his mother. He told his mother, "Mom, do you have the kindness, gentleness, respect, thrift, and modesty of Confucius? If you don't, you don’t have the right to tell me what to do.” His mother was shocked. The child was already using the language of the classics to argue with her. What would happen if he continued to read? Therefore, we must first establish a foundation of virtuous conduct.

“If one acts but does not learn, one will rely on one's own views, and one will be oblivious to the truth.”

I have an elder relative who came to our house with her granddaughter while my parents were also present. As soon as she sat down, she said to her granddaughter, "Come on, let’s recite some English for these elders to hear." The little girl was very fluent. I’m sure she had not just performed this for us. She had probably done it many times before. Her grandmother then asked, "How do you say 'apple'?" The little girl said, "Apple." "How do you say 'umbrella'?" The little girl said, "Umbrella." She answered many questions correctly. Suddenly, the little girl asked her grandmother, "Grandma, how do you say 'book'?" Her grandmother said, "I don't know!" The little girl said, "Grandma, you're so stupid!" If children have not learned how to be a person and how to handle affairs, the more knowledge they acquire and the more books they read, the more arrogant they will become. "Arrogance" is a great killer of learning. Once arrogance arises, it is very difficult to achieve anything in one's studies. *The Book of Rites* mentions, "Arrogance must not be allowed to grow." These are all very important reminders from the sages.

Mr. Lin Zexu, after reflecting on his life, summed up ten mistakes that would render a person’s life useless. He called them the “ten useless things.” Among these "ten useless things," two points were very important reminders regarding learning: "If one is proud and arrogant, extensive learning is useless" and "If one’s conduct is improper, reading books is useless." Therefore, if a scholar is arrogant, the higher their education, the more contempt they will have for others, and the more likely they are to hurt others. If a person's words and actions go against the teachings of the sages, reading is not beneficial if they do not practice them.

**2. In Class, We Must Learn with Diligence and Focus, and We Must Not Play While Doing Homework**

"There are three things to focus on when reading: mind, eyes, and mouth. Each must be sincere.”

We must be very focused when reading the classics in order to gain something. Therefore, we are very careful when teaching children their first lesson. First, we require them to sit properly before reading and that their books must be straight. When they read with respect, and maintain this attitude from the very beginning, it will become a lifelong habit. If they sit crookedly during their first lesson and their eyes are wandering, it will be difficult for them to gain any real benefit.

The book, *Standards for Students*, was compiled by Master Li Yuxiu of the Qing Dynasty based on the teachings of Confucius. He organized it based on everyday life, so this book was not easily compiled. Once, a child accidentally knocked another child's book to the ground. The child who dropped the book immediately picked it up and quickly dusted it off. This is called “first impressions are most important.” If you give a child a book by saying that it was a free gift, and carelessly throw the book to the child, will your child respect the book? Impossible. Therefore, we should guide our children and lead by example at every turn.

Learning depends on constant accumulation. There is a saying, "Constant dripping wears away the stone." Which is harder, stone or water? Stone. Why is it that water, which is soft, can actually wear through something as hard as stone? Because it drips constantly, one drop after another. It might take ten thousand drops, a million drops, or even more, but eventually, it will wear through the stone. This is the principle of “using the soft to overcome the hard.” "Constant dripping wears away the stone” is like our attitude toward learning. We must diligently learn each word one by one, and with time, your learning will have the strength to wear away the stone. We refer to our hand as the "constant dripping hand." Every drop brings the stone closer to being worn away. This hand must constantly and intently point at the word we are reading, remembering and understanding each word. So, in reciting the classics, we teach the children to use their eyes to look at the book, their fingers to point at the book, and their mouths to read along, all while their hearts are present. Their heart, eyes, mouth, and hand must all be focused and engaged.


Okay, here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, aiming for accuracy and readability while maintaining the tone and intent of the original:

**3.  Learning Should Not Be Greedy for Quantity or Speed; Cultivate Patience and Focus**

“Do not admire ‘that’ while reading ‘this’; do not begin ‘that’ before ‘this’ is finished.”

There is a significant pitfall in learning today: greed for quantity. People believe that more is necessarily better, but this is not the case, as more often leads to confusion. The *Book of Rites* (*Li Ji*) contains a teaching: “If things are presented in a mixed and unordered manner, they will become chaotic and unrefined.” If a child is made to learn too many things at once, without considering whether they are truly absorbing it, they will inevitably learn poorly and may even develop an aversion to learning. Many children today study three or four extracurricular activities simultaneously; what is the end result? A dislike of learning. Therefore, in learning, in acquiring knowledge, and even in learning worldly skills, one should be focused and not scattered.

Teacher Yang has been practicing calligraphy for forty-one years. When she teaches calligraphy, she insists that children write just the first stroke of the “永” (yong – eternity) character, the "dot," thousands of times before moving on to the next stroke. Do calligraphy teachers today teach like this? Many in the calligraphy world say, "Come study for three months, and I guarantee you'll win an award." Should we go? We must be calm! What is their attitude towards learning art? They are eager for quick results and personal gain. Our calligraphy is meant for self-cultivation, for nurturing the mind. Thus, beginning teaching with a utilitarian approach goes against the very essence of art. Therefore, we must provide children with the correct guidance. In the art of Chinese calligraphy, when a child can write this single “dot” well, their patience and perseverance are developed in the process. Their foundation is solid, and if their base is firm, further development will not lead to collapse. However, if their base is not solid, the faster they develop, the more dangerous it is.

Through learning calligraphy, Teacher Yang came to understand how to make each character’s structure appear perfectly orderly. Because of this approach, when handling matters, she also applies this sense of awareness – how things should be arranged to avoid chaos.  Furthermore, her focus has been strengthened through calligraphy. Once focus is achieved, she can handle both interpersonal relationships and daily tasks in an orderly fashion. The ultimate goal of learning art is to enhance moral character, which is why Confucius said, “Have your will set on the Way (道 – Dao); abide by virtue; rely upon benevolence; and enjoy the arts (遊於藝).” Even the enjoyment of the arts is inseparable from cultivating morality and fostering a good character. Therefore, with a strong foundation in calligraphy and a solid character, Teacher Yang, when learning other arts, such as traditional painting and seal carving, has a high level of artistic sensitivity, learning much faster than others, and even learning computers quickly.

“Do not admire ‘that’ while reading ‘this’” applies to learning skills as well as to reading. One should finish one book before starting another.  During the Song Dynasty, Zhao Pu told Emperor Taizu of Song that he had used half of the *Analects* to assist him in gaining control of the country. So, is it necessary to have many books? The most important thing is to grasp the key principles and put them into practice. Therefore, learning should absolutely avoid greed for quantity and never rush.  Too much haste makes the mind restless and does not align with the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, Mr. Zeng Guofan also said that one's mind should not be without books, but one's desk should not have too many books. You cannot, after a lecture, realize the greatness of Chinese culture and then pull all the *Four Books* and *Five Classics* down from your bookshelf, resolving to finish them all this month. This will be very difficult; you must grasp the key principles. Therefore, “do not begin ‘that’ before ‘this’ is finished.”

Many people, after hearing this, ask, "Does that mean my child only needs to memorize the *Standards for Being a Good Student and Child* (*Di Zi Gui*), and not any other classics?" That is not the meaning. The *Di Zi Gui* is not meant to be memorized, but to serve as a constant reminder, allowing its principles to take root in the heart. When they are also reciting other classics, they should continue to recite them; the *Classic of Filial Piety* (*Xiao Jing*) and the *Analects* are all fine. But this type of life education, moral character education, must be emphasized daily. Because reciting the classics is to cultivate focus, while the *Di Zi Gui* guides speech and behavior to be in accordance with the principles. When one’s behavior is in accordance with the principles, it naturally aligns with the profound truths found in these classics.

**4.  Take Initiative in Studying, Without Being Pushed**

“Be lenient in setting goals, but diligent in effort; when sufficient effort is made, all obstacles will be overcome.”

Do you ever feel that there are not enough hours in a day? It’s very rare now that we can find two hours in a day to read, so we can break the “spare” (餘) time in "spare time to learn" into fragments, making good use of even short bits of time. I keep the *Di Zi Gui* or *Reflections on Life* (*Geyan Lianbi*) with me in my bag and read a sentence or two whenever I have a spare moment. Don’t underestimate the accumulation of ten or twenty minutes a day; over time, even a drop of water can wear through stone.  This is the meaning of “Be lenient in setting goals, but diligent in effort; when sufficient effort is made, all obstacles will be overcome.”

Reading should be planned, but don't schedule it so tightly that you feel pressured. “Be lenient in setting goals, but diligent in effort” means that you should constantly urge yourself to work hard. What should you do if you get drowsy while studying?  The *Three Character Classic* mentions "suspending one's head from the beams" and "piercing one's thigh with an awl"; this shows the determination of the ancients. Of course, we cannot allow children to harm themselves, but we can teach them to splash cold water on their face when they feel sleepy; that will help them feel refreshed. Or you can place a picture of Confucius on their desk, so they will feel embarrassed when they are drowsy and will rally themselves to continue reading.  The methods vary for each person. Or you can create a good learning environment at home, with family members encouraging and reminding each other. Many teachers play audio recordings of the *Di Zi Gui* each morning as an alarm clock. “Be lenient in setting goals, but diligent in effort; when sufficient effort is made, all obstacles will be overcome.” When we can unite knowledge with practice, difficulties that seemed insurmountable can be readily solved, and with wisdom, we need not fear a lack of good methods.

**5.  When You Encounter Something You Don’t Understand in Studying or Life, Humbly Seek Guidance**

"If your mind has doubts, record them promptly; seek clarification from others; strive for true understanding.”

The essence of learning is learning how to ask questions. But you must ask the right person, someone who is skilled and knowledgeable in the specific area.  As the saying goes, “Those who know the Way are ahead, those skilled in their craft are specialists.”  Would you ask me how to cook?  That would be asking the wrong person. You can, however, ask me how to cook noodles.  Why? Because I live in Haikou on my own; I have no one to take care of my meals.  So, I have to do everything myself – sweep, wash clothes, mop the floor, and cook. It is through this process that I experience the labor and learn to be grateful. Who do I think about? My mother is so great! Because every day is so busy, I must emphasize efficiency, so I can only cook noodles. I boil a pot of water, then put the cut vegetables in it. In just twenty to thirty minutes, I can have a bowl of noodles, with some sesame sauce – and I am content, which is called “being content with what you have.”

When seeking advice, many people tend to ask those who agree with their own views. Do you see this tendency?  Even though they know they can't let go of something, they ask the most stubborn person they know, and then they feel like they must be right. As the saying goes, “Good medicine tastes bitter, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ear.” People are afraid to ask those who will be direct, but those people are usually the ones who can truly benefit you. Therefore, “If your mind has doubts, record them promptly; seek clarification from others; strive for true understanding.” If you have this kind of eagerness to learn, those who have virtue and knowledge will not hesitate to tell you. As your doubts diminish, it's like the clouds parting, and your mind will become clear, and wisdom will emerge.

**6. Cultivate the Habit of Tidying Your Room, Keeping It Clean and Neat**

"Rooms should be clean, walls spotless, desks clear, and writing utensils properly placed."

The most important thing here is to create a good learning environment. The place where you study or read cannot be messy, or you won't be able to settle your mind. Therefore, “Rooms should be clean, walls spotless,” so when you walk in, you feel serene and comfortable.  Also, “desks clear, and writing utensils properly placed.”  Indeed, the human mind is influenced by its external environment. When the environment is clean, the mind becomes clear. All things should have their designated place, so when you need them, your mind will not be confused, and you will easily find things.

**7.  When Learning, Keep Your Posture Upright, Your Books Straight, and Your Writing Careful**

"If you grind ink unevenly, the mind is not upright; if writing is not respectful, the mind is already ill."

Actually, the heart and actions are consistent; all our external behavior affects our state of mind. Thinking back to the teachings of the *Di Zi Gui*, when we speak disrespectfully, our hearts also become disrespectful. For example, “When elders stand, juniors should not sit; when elders sit, only then may juniors sit. In eating, drinking, walking, and sitting, the elders go first, juniors follow.”  These are all external behaviors, but they continuously influence our state of mind.  “Walk calmly, stand upright, bow deeply and respectfully, and show reverence in your greetings. Do not step on the threshold, do not lean or slouch, do not sit with your legs spread, do not shake your knees.” Why are these actions so important? When a person slouches, leans, sits with their legs spread, or shakes their knees, it not only hurts their body, but also their mind.  When our posture is casual, our minds gradually become casual and arrogant.

Why did the ancients place so much emphasis on behavior and decorum? Many people may think, “Isn’t that very tiring?”  Actually, it isn’t.  At first, you may feel unaccustomed to it, but once you break through that habit, when our speech is polite, we are respectful and know how to conduct ourselves, we will feel very comfortable and at ease, because it resonates with our true nature. It not only benefits ourselves, but also makes our family and friends happy and refreshed. Since every word and action affects our state of mind, we must always maintain proper posture.

"If you grind ink unevenly, the mind is not upright."  Grinding ink unevenly is not good. In every action, we must consider how we can do it well, how we can make our minds upright. If you use this standard, you won’t go wrong. "If writing is not respectful, the mind is already ill."  If we write in a hurried, rushed manner, and have to write so many characters every day, our mind at that time is false. Therefore, we should also write without haste, one stroke at a time, properly. Writing and letters are a means of communication. If our handwriting is poor, it will give people a bad impression. When our minds are not hurried or scattered, our handwriting will gradually become upright. We should refine our state of mind through the details of daily life.

**8.  After Finishing Homework, Put Away Books and Stationery Neatly**

"Arrange your books in a designated place, and return them there after reading."

"Arrange your books in a designated place, and return them there after reading" means that objects should return to their proper place. After reading a book, put it back where it belongs; then you will be able to find it easily next time.

"Even if in a hurry, bind and tidy them up; if damaged or broken, repair them."

We should also cherish books. "If damaged or broken," we should repair them immediately. In ancient times, books were hard to come by, so people cherished them greatly. If there was damage, it was repaired immediately. Now that printing technology is very advanced, this does not mean we should disrespect or not cherish books. We can make book covers to protect them, or put them in bookcases to extend their lifespan, which is all part of caring for books.

**9.  Do Not Watch Useless TV or Read Useless Newspapers; Choose Content That Helps Your Morality**

"Do not look at non-sage books; they will cloud your intelligence and corrupt your character."

In this era, we must have the ability to judge when choosing books. Nowadays, with the explosion of knowledge, many children read the wrong books. One child, only five or six years old, read a book on psychology. Originally, he was saying to his mother, “Mom, I want a younger brother.” After reading the psychology book, he immediately told his mother, “You can't have a younger brother, because if you do, you won't love me.”  Is reading good?  It is only good if you read the right books; reading the wrong books is pollution.

Sometimes when I chat with colleagues, they say certain variety shows are hilarious; they laugh so hard they almost fall on the floor. I ask, "Do you think the hosts are doing the right thing, when they dig into other people’s private lives and make jokes at their expense?” They say, of course not! But when you laugh, and your son laughs along with you, he will think that Dad thinks it's funny, and that it's okay to act that way. So, children, through what they see and hear, can become careless with their language and tend to take advantage of others, and will make inappropriate jokes.  When you discover that your child’s speech has lost all sense of proper measure, it will be hard to correct them. It's the same with TV and the content of books. So if a child’s mind is contaminated, you have to spend much more time clearing it, which is very troublesome! Therefore, we must use rational judgment to prevent incorrect knowledge from polluting ourselves and our children.

So what books or teachings should we study to truly build our intellect? Let’s consider this question further. A psychologist wrote one book at age forty and another at age sixty. Which book would you read? Some say the one from when he was sixty. Why? He has more experience. But experience comes in good and bad forms; should we learn from bad experience?  Many people say that his life experience means he probably has a higher level of wisdom, but we need to reflect on that "probably." Does living longer make someone wiser? Not necessarily. Society is like a giant dye vat. Is a twenty-year-old more pure, or a forty-year-old?  Is purity closer to wisdom, or is complexity?  You cannot be vague about things; you must be clear and precise, to be sure you’re placing the right bet. If you bet wrong, you can’t turn back in life, so you must be cautious and careful. If you just believe that he “probably” spoke correctly and give your life to him or even the future happiness of your children to him, that is too dangerous. You cannot simply believe whatever someone says, because what they say may not be proven to be wisdom or truth. However, Chinese culture, after thousands of years of collective human experience, has proven its truths, and the wisdom of the Chinese sages transcends both time and space.

Four or five thousand years ago, people were told to practice filial piety; after four or five thousand years, do we still need filial piety? Yes, so it transcends time. Does China need filial piety and also other countries? Foreigners who hear the teaching of filial piety are also very pleased because "At birth, people are inherently good.” We held a class on *Di Zi Gui* in Australia, and since *Di Zi Gui* contains many passages based on the virtuous deeds of the sages, like “In the morning, greet your parents; at night, check in with them.” which was practiced by King Wen of Zhou, and "In winter, make the bed warm; in summer, keep it cool.” which was practiced by Huang Xiang of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Every time, when we taught the passages, we recounted these stories in detail. We noticed that many local Australians were nodding their heads in agreement, and we wondered what they were thinking. After the class, we had a discussion with them, and these Australian friends said that people should behave like that. Therefore, filial piety transcends time and space, and this kind of truth is worth our while to pursue and study in depth during our short lives.

When we truly have intellect, we will make the right choices, the most important of which are our thoughts and beliefs. What is the state of your thoughts and beliefs right now? Why are thoughts and beliefs so important? Because thoughts determine your actions; actions determine your habits; habits form your character, and character determines your fate. So, you can know whether a person will have a happy life based on their thoughts.

Many parents say, “My child has neither improved nor worsened.” Is that possible?  Learning is like sailing upstream; if you don’t advance, you retreat.  Society today is like a big dye vat; if you don't quickly teach your child good things, they will definitely learn bad things. I used to teach in some remote areas, and people often think that since remote areas are less polluted, children there are more pure. But that is not the case, because there is a great demon, omnipresent, that can reach you whether you live in the mountains or the countryside, to tell you incorrect views. Who is this great demon? Television! So, we must be vigilant and quickly teach our children the correct attitudes and beliefs; otherwise, they will learn incorrect things little by little every day. Therefore, when you let your children watch TV, you must choose good, non-polluting programs.

Television and computers often show images of greed, anger, ignorance, and arrogance. We see that many children's speech is extremely rebellious and rude, which is not necessarily learned from their parents, but from the influence of TV and computers. And watching TV and computers has a kind of hypnotic effect. Have you noticed that people who watch TV seem isolated from the world, and they don't respond when others call them? Why? Because the radiation and magnetic waves from the TV make their brain feel as if it has been isolated in a room for 96 hours. Therefore, the more people watch TV, the less they think. TV has serious effects on children's brains. You can look up an article called “Children Raised by Television.”

“Do not look at non-sage books; they will cloud your intelligence and corrupt your character.” Non-sage books must be avoided. It is better to not read books at all rather than associate with harmful influences for even a single day. Here, "harmful influences" does not just refer to people, but also to books and media. Why is it better not to read any books rather than associate with harmful influences? Because an unpolluted person is like a glass of clear water. If it is polluted, it is like a drop of ink falling into it; that may take less than a second, but how long does it take to clean that drop of ink out? Perhaps ten or a hundred times as much time. Therefore, preventing contamination is extremely important. We must also have the ability to judge which books we must absolutely avoid. And those that we do read should be the classics that have been proven over thousands of years. We must be diligent when choosing TV for our children, not letting them watch programs that promote violence, pornography, or other harmful ideas.

**10. Believe in Yourself, Believe in the Realm of the Sages; We Can Attain It, Too**

“Do not be self-deprecating or give up on yourself; sages and worthies can be achieved through training.”

We must also have high expectations of ourselves and strive to improve, having confidence that “At birth, people are inherently good.” As long as we persevere with diligence, we will surely attain the realm of the sages. The key lies in faith. We must have faith in ourselves, in the sages, and in our teachers. You must have faith in your children and in all your family and friends, because everyone has an inherently good heart.

We must also understand why we should study the teachings of the sages. “The Way of Great Learning consists in manifesting one’s luminous virtue, in loving the people, and in abiding in perfect goodness.” Life is about self-awakening, helping others awaken, and achieving the perfection of practice. “Manifesting one's luminous virtue” means allowing our own inherent goodness to shine. When a person manifests their luminous virtue, and has wisdom, they can naturally manage their family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world, thus loving the people. “Loving” means cherishing, but it also means making them new. To make the people new means making those around us be able to be "renewed daily, renew themselves daily, and continue to be renewed.” What can be renewed daily? Our thoughts, our beliefs, and our character. When we constantly improve ourselves and help others to the greatest extent possible, reaching the point of "giving our all, and stopping only at death," then we will have "abided in perfect goodness."
